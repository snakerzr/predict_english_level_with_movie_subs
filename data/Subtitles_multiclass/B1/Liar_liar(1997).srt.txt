W- O R K! Work. Today we're going to share\Nwhat our parents do for... Work! My mommy is a doctor. My daddy is a truck driver. My mom's a teacher. And your dad? Mmm... My dad... He's... a liar. A liar? Oh, I- I'm sure\Nyou don't mean a liar. Well, he wears a suit and goes\Nto court and talks to the judge. Oh! I see. You mean he's a lawyer. Hey, Fletcher.\NHow'd it go? Just another victory\Nfor the wrongly accused. Yeah, right. Mr. Reede, great job.\NDo you want your coat back? No, I'm sure you'll be\Nneeding it again and again. Do you have a moment? I'm late. It's my day\Nto be with my son. A couple of reporters want\Nto talk about your big win. Yeah? How's my hair? Fabulous. You look great. What time is it? I am sure your dad just\Ngot held up in court again. Dad! Maximilian! Hey, how you doing, creep? Good. Me too, except my arm\Nhas been bothering me. Oh, no, Dad! Oh, yeah. It's becoming a claw! Nothing can stop the claw! Run, boy, run!\NSave yourself! Do the claw to Mom!\NDo the claw to Mom! You found the claw's\Nonly weakness. Subzero temperatures! So, did you have any trouble\Nfinding the place? Okay, I'm late. I'm sorry.\NI ran out of gas. The gauge is broken.\NRough neighborhood too. Good thing I was wearing\Nneutral gang colors. I might have had to pull out\Nmy nine and bust a cap. With my mind on my money\Nand my money on my mind They would never hurt you,\NFletcher. You're their lawyer. That was below the belt.\NKeep the gloves up. Mom, Dad's taking me\Nto see wrestling! Oh, Fletcher! Oh, Audrey! Why do you have to take him to\Nsee that stuff? It's very violent. The boy must grow\Nto be a warrior. Who better to guide him\Nthan Rick Rude and Randy "Macho Man" Savage\Nin the cage of death? Oh, good! Jerry, how's it going? Hey, gipper! You look like\Nyou grow by the minute! Fletcher, pleasure to see you. Hi, honey!\NHi. Wow. That was a nice image.\NDeleted. I have some more boxes\Nfor you. Oh, you're an angel. Boxes? Remember, I told you a few weeks\Nago, Jerry's moving to Boston. Oh, right! The job, the thing.\NWhat do you do again? Hospital administrator. Right, right! Well, the boxes are\Nin my car. Oh, those can wait. I made this young man\Na promise, didn't I? Got time to throw a few? Sure! Come on, then! I forgot the boyfriend\Nwas moving. Jerry! His name is Jerry!\NAnd yes, he's moving. I'm sorry. I hated him less\Nthan your other boyfriends. It wasn't serious, was it? Semi-serious, yes. You guys aren't...\NYou know... I have been dating him\Nfor seven months. What do you think? Really? I was hoping after being married\Nto me you'd have no strength left. Remember,\Nwhen we were married, I wasn't having sex\Nnearly as often as you were. Ouch! And the ref\Ntakes a point away. Out! Max is gonna miss him. I'll be here. Ready? Yeah! Play ball. Max, come on. We've gotta go. Dad, are we really\Ngoing to wrestling? Absolutely,\NMax Factor. We just have to stop\Nby the office for one minute. Excuse me, sir.\NAny spare change? Oh, I'm sorry.\NI'm all out. I can't do it. Fred, it's your duty to present\Nthe strongest case possible. The strongest case possible\Nconsistent with the truth. Will you let the judge\Ndecide what's true? That's what he gets paid for.\NYou get paid to win. If you insist that\NI take it to trial, I will represent Mrs. Cole\Naggressively and ethically. But Miranda, I won't lie. Then we'll just have\Nto find someone who will. Twenty-first floor.\NMen's wear. Hi, Mr. Reede! Hey. Did you do\Nsomething to your hair? It's a bit extreme,\Nisn't it? No! That's the thing\Nnowadays, right? He said it would\Naccent my facial features. That's what it does! It completely accents\Nyour facial features. We're just gonna go\Nto my office... Hey, Fletcher. Hey, Pete. You losing a little weight? I don't know. Maybe. Looks and personality.\NA double-threat guy. Hey, Mr. Reede.\NHey... man. It's, uh, Randy. Yeah, I know. Taking lunch orders.\NAnything? No, thanks. I had so much for breakfast,\NI'm ready to pop. I mean, I'm full. Okay. Great. Max! Hi, Greta. Hey, what's new? It's my birthday tomorrow,\Nand we're having a party. Wow! I am sure your daddy has\Ngot you something wonderful. Yeah? Yeah, you bet!\NListen, kiddo. Why don't you play\Nin my office for a minute. Sue somebody for\Neverything they've got. Maybe you can send a fax to one\Nof your girlfriends. Hey, sorry. Damn it!\NI completely forgot. Oh, what a surprise. You are a saint.\NI should buy you a gift. You did. I always do the classy thing.\NAny calls? Judge Rawlings' clerk\Nneeds your filing. Tell him it's in the mail. Right.\NYou'll do it next week. Mr. McKinley phoned to\Nconfirm your meeting tomorrow. Strep throat. Some kind of\Nvirus. What's going around? Asian flu? Good one. And your mother called. I'm on vacation. It's your fifth week. Snowed in.\NPhones are down. Break mother's heart.\NDone. That's it. Except Miranda's\Nlooking for you. How much ass do I have\Nto kiss to make partner? Tell her I broke my leg\Nand I had to be shot. Tell her yourself. And then send out a notice\Nof judgment on my win today! I'll get right on it. Miranda!\NHey, I didn't see you. You look beautiful today. Here!\NI bought you a gift. Oh, thanks. I heard about\Nyour victory. Congratulations. You're making quite an impression\Non the partnership committee. That's right! You folks\Nare meeting again soon. I've been so busy, I haven't\Neven thought about it. Anyway. I have\Na client in my office. Better not\Nkeep him waiting. Actually, something rather\Nimportant's just come up. You're not busy tonight,\Nare you? We're not going, are we? Audrey. You know how there are\Nmoments you know are critical? Mmm-hmm. And choices that\Nhave to be made upon which all one's\Nfuture happiness will depend? Mmm-hmm. This is one of those moments. What are you trying to say? Will you marry me? You're moving. I know, but I want you\Nand Max to come with me. Audrey, I've been giving this\Na lot of thought. You know I'm not prone to\Nwild flights of romantic fancy. But the thought of you and I\Ntogether just makes sense. Now I'm ready. I think\Nyou're ready. I love Max. You love Max.\NIt's right. It fits. So what do you say? Hey, creepy. Happy birthday. How old are you now, 22 or 23? I'm five, Dad. Okay. Return the beer keg. Cancel the dancing girls. I don't know\Nwhat I'm gonna do. I feel completely\Nunprepared for this. You see, I bought you\Na present, but last night I accidentally swallowed it. Dad, it's in your belly! Scalpel. I hope it's not\Npartially digested! Look out! Cool! What is it?\NCool! It's... It's a surprise. All right, it's a pony.\NJust open it! I'm gonna help,\N'cause I can't stand it! Baseball stuff! Cool! Can we play? I'll be Nomo. You can be\NJose Canseco. Can we play? Absolutely. Yeah! Right after your\Nparty tonight, we'll do it. You and me. I just have to really\Nconcentrate on this right now. Hi! Hey! Happy birthday. Thanks, Mom. Happy birthday, Max! One, two, three, four, five.\NAnd one for good luck! He struck the child.\NDid you see that? Look at what Dad got me! Whoa! Great! Hey, I have\Nmy glove in the car. Maybe we can stop at the park\Non the way home and play catch. Then tonight we can rub oil in it\Nand wrap a big rubber band around it. It'll be great.\NHey, great gift, Dad! Thanks, son. I'm so glad my gift\Ncould bring those two together. My plan to phase myself out\Nis almost complete. Something's come up,\Nand we need to talk. Come on, Mom.\NI want to go play! And actually it's kind of important,\Nso maybe we could talk tonight? Tonight? Yes. Max's birthday party. Oh! Yeah. Sure. Of course.\NWe'll talk then. Great! Maximus! I'm outta here. Bye, Dad. Jerry, enjoy my wife. Well, this is good. This is really smart. Thank you.\NOnly... Well, it's not true.\NDoes that present a problem? Mrs. Cole,\Nthe only problem here is that after you've provided years\Nof faithful service and loving support, of raising his children,\Nthey are his? Huh? Oh. Yeah, yeah.\NOne for sure. After all that, your husband\Nwants to deny you a fair share of the assets\Nbased on one act of indiscretion. Seven.\NPardon me? Seven single acts\Nof indiscretion. Seven acts of indiscretion, only\None of which he has any evidence of and all of which he himself\Nis responsible for. He is? Mrs. Cole. You're the victim here. The wife\Nof a cold, distant workaholic. Starved for affection, driven\Ninto the arms of another man! Seven.\NYeah, whatever! You're not trying to deny him\Nwhat is rightfully his. All you're insisting on\Nis what is rightfully yours. Yeah.\NAnd maybe a... fraction more. I think you're bending\Nover backwards. Yeah. I did offer to give him\Njoint custody of the kids. He is, after all,\Na wonderful father. And how does he repay you? By dragging you through\Na painful litigation process! No, no, no, no!\NThis can't happen! With all due respect, this isn't\Nabout you and Mr. Cole anymore. This is about all women. Where would Tina Turner be right\Nnow if she'd rolled over and said, "Hit me again, Ike,\Nand put some stank on it?" Rolling on the river,\Nthat's where she'd be. But she's beyond Thunderdome,\Nbecause she decided to send a message. Wake up, sisters! There's no such thing as a weaker sex! You know what? You're right, Mr. Reede. I am\Ntired of getting kicked around! Good for you! Thank you. I am so grateful to have an attorney\NI can trust. Oh, you are good. You are very, very good. The Cole case is worth a\Ntruckload of money to this firm. If you win, I guarantee\Nyou'll make partner. In fact, how would you like to make a partner right now? Oh, I don't know. I should... Happy, happy, happy\Nhappy, happy, happy Happy\NI'm so happy today I live in the USA So honey? Have you thought about... You know,\Nwhat we talked about? Yeah. I can't go. What? Why not? Because of Max. But he'll love it there. I'm gonna take him\Nto Fenway Park. There's hiking and camping... Well, really,\Nit's... Fletcher. Fletcher? Come on, honey. He wouldn't even come over\Nunless you reminded him. I know, but when he does\Ncome over, Max is so happy. It's like they have their\Nown little world together. The gipper and I\Nhave that too! I know, but it's different. How? Well... He does the claw. The what? The claw. You know, it's like this... I don't... Run for you life.\NIt's the claw! The claw! I can't really do it that\Ngood. That's not the point. The point is if they're 3,000 miles apart,\Nthey're never gonna see each other. Fletcher's never gonna\Ncome to Boston. Hello.\NAudrey? Fletcher! Where are you? We're waiting. Max won't cut\Nthe cake until you get here. Oh, man! Actually, something\Nhas come up. I've... I've got this problem\Non a new case. What happened?\NNothing! I stubbed my toe on the desk! I'm really sorry,\Nbut I just can't make it. The boss is, uh,\Nreally riding me. Fletcher, it's his birthday! I know, I know. I'll make it up to him,\NI promise. I'll pick him up\Nfrom school tomorrow, okay? You're gonna pick him up? Yes! All right, hold on a minute.\NYou can say happy birthday. No! Gotta go! Goodbye. Hello. Happy birthday to you Happy birthday, dear Max Happy birthday to you Okay, birthday boy.\NMake a wish. Come on, Max.\NIt can be anything you want. Anything in the whole world. Max. Your father is sorry.\NHe had to work. He said he was gonna\Nbe here. He promised. I know, but he promises that\Nhe is gonna see you tomorrow. Okay? He's gonna pick you up\Nfrom school. All right? So come on. Make a wish. I wish that for only one day\NDad couldn't tell a lie. That was incredible. Was it good for you? I've had better. "I've had better"? "I've had better"? "I've had better"? Hi.\NHi. New in the building? Yeah,\NI just moved in Monday. Oh! You like it so far? Mmm-hmm.\NEverybody's been real nice. Well, that's because\Nyou have big jugs. I mean, your boobs are huge. I mean, I wanna squeeze them. Mama. Any change, mister? Absolutely. Could you spare some? Yes, I could. Will you?\NHow come? Because I believe you will\Nbuy booze with it! I just wanna get\Nto the office without being confronted by\Nthe decay of Western society! Plus, I'm cheap! Jerk-off! You look like you're\Nhaving a rough morning. Ding, ding, ding! What do\Nwe have for her, Johnny? Fletcher. Dana. All right, Samantha. How much will it take\Nto put an end to all this? Fifty percent\Nof your estate. Fifty percent? With a pre-nup and proof of\Nadultery? What's your case? Our case is simply this. Very funny, Fletcher! You wanna play hardball?\NI'm game. "You wanna play hardball?\NI'm game. " What are you doing?\NWhat is wrong with you? All rise for the Honorable\NJudge Marshall Stevens. Honorable? Good morning.\NCall case number BD-00305. Samantha Cole v. Richard Cole. How are we doing this morning,\NCounsel? Fine. Thank you. And you, Mr. Reede? I'm a little upset about a\Nbad sexual episode last night. Well, you're still young.\NIt'll happen more and more. In the meantime, what do you\Nsay we get down to business? First, Mr. Reede, I see... I would like a continuance! This case has been delayed\Nseveral times, Mr. Reede. I realize that, Your Honor, but I\Nwould really, really like a continuance. I'll have to hear good cause,\NCounsel. What's the problem? I can't lie! Commendable, Mr. Reede, but\NI'm waiting to hear good cause. Do you have one or not? Not. Motion for continuance denied. Is there any chance\Nof a settlement in this case? I don't think so,\NYour Honor. My client has already offered\NMrs. Cole $2.4 million. But Mr. Reede has made it\Nclear he has no desire... Settle! Settle, settle,\Nsettle, settle! I don't want to settle. Mr. Reede. You convinced me\Nyesterday, I'm the victim! I'm starved for affection. I'm\Ndriven into the arms of another man. Seven!\NYeah, whatever. With the story you came up\Nwith, I don't think we can lose. I want to proceed. Mrs. Cole,\Nyou don't understand. Mr. Reede.\NDo we have a settlement? No! No, Your Honor. There's no settlement. Trial to commence 1:30 sharp. It was me! Hi, Mr. Reede!\NLike the new dress? Whatever takes the focus\Noff your head. What's up, Fletcher? Your cholesterol, fatty!\NDead man walking. Hey, Fletcher.\NHey! You're not important enough\Nto remember. What's it gonna be,\NMr. Reede? A pockmark, eventually! Don't ask!\NFor God's sakes, don't ask. All right.\NYou can beat this. It's all a matter\Nof willpower! A test. Something small. Red. Red. All right?\NNow focus. The color of this pen is... The color of this pen is... The color of the pen\Nthat I hold in my hand is... royal blue! One lie, and I can't say it! I'll write it. Write it! Write it,\Nor I'll break it off! No! Come on! Stop it. Boss? What happened? The pen is blue.\NThe pen is blue! The goddamn pen is blue! Mr. Reede,\Nare you all right? I gotta go home. Home?\NWas the case settled? No! I have to be\Nin court at 1:30! Then how are you\Ngoing to go home? I don't know. I don't know. Okay. Mr. Reede,\NReuben and Dunn called. They need to know where the\NDarby settlement offer stands. I just proposed a settlement\Nto dick with them! Dick with them. Got it. And your mother called. Are you still on vacation? No. Then you're here?\NYes. Thank you for clearing\Nthat up, sir. And your ex-wife called. She wants to know when you're\Ncoming to pick up your son. Oh, I'm such a shit! Hello.\NAudrey? Fletcher, hi. Are you still\Npicking Max up from school today? Here's the thing.\NI really can't! I had a case I was\Ncertain would settle, and it didn't,\Nand I have to go to court. Right. It's true! I really\Nwant to see Max today! I really do. But things just keep coming up\Nat the last minute. Yes, but this time\Nit's different. I see. How is that? Now I'm telling the truth. And last night you weren't.\NNo. Well, what were you doing? Having sex! Well, I hope that it was\Nwith someone very special. No! That's the thing. I don't\Neven like her, but she's a partner. I thought I could help my\Ncareer by making her squeal. What's wrong with me? I'm getting what I deserve.\NI'm reaping what I sow. I'm... Is Dad still picking me up? No, Max, he's not. I'm sorry, but I'm gonna\Npick you up, okay? I'll work it out. I guess my wish\Ndidn't come true. What wish? I wished that for just one day\NDad couldn't tell a lie. Max? I have something important\Nto talk to you about, okay? Okay.\NOkay. Hello? Audrey! Let me explain.\NSomething has happened to me. Well, something else\Nis about to happen to you. Max and I are\Nmoving to Boston. What? Jerry has asked me\Nto marry him, and Max and I are going this\Nweekend to look at houses. I thought it was semi-serious! It's just been given\Na violent shove into serious. You can't move to Boston,\NI'll never see Max! You'll have the same relationship\Nyou have with him now, won't you? Where are you?\NI'm going home. When you get there, just stay there.\NI'm coming over. We have to talk. Fletcher!\NI'll be right there. Hey, Mr. Reede... Fletcher.\NHoly hell! You can run,\Nbut you can't hide. What's your problem, schmuck? I'm an inconsiderate prick! Oh, shit! Shit! You know why\NI pulled you over? Depends on how long\Nyou were following me! Why don't we take it\Nfrom the top? Here goes. I sped, I followed too\Nclosely, I ran a stop sign, I almost hit a Chevy, I sped\Nsome more, I failed to yield, I changed lanes without\Nsignaling while speeding! Is that all? No. I have unpaid parking tickets. Be gentle. Audrey! Wait! Wait, Audrey. Hold on. Wait! Wait. I just had an insight\Ninto myself. I'm crazy. You call and say,\N"Wait, I'll be right over," and here's the crazy part,\NI actually wait. I can explain this. I have missed\Na department meeting. Did you come in a cab?\NYes! Where's your car? Thank you! I can't tell you\Nhow much this means to me. I can. $1,654.11. How do you sleep at night? I'm taking this. You scratched my car! Where? Right there! Oh, there.\NThat was already there. Why, you... You liar! You know what\NI'm gonna do about this? What? Nothing! Because if I take you to court,\Nit'll drain eight hours out of my life, and you won't show up, and if I got the judgment,\Nyou'd just stiff me anyway! So I'm gonna piss and moan\Nlike an impotent jerk and then bend over\Nand take it up the tailpipe! You been here before,\Nhaven't you? Well, I can't remember\Nwhen I've had more fun, but if you'll excuse me,\NI have a class. Are you marrying this guy\Nbecause you're mad at me? No, I divorced you\Nbecause I was mad at you. Wait. I want to\Ntalk about this! What do you want to say? Is this guy right for you?\NHe is so not me! That's one of his\Nbest qualities. But he's kind of a magoo. I'm sorry.\NYou're wrong. Sometimes\Nmaybe he is a little... Magoo! Yes. But since\Nwe've been going out... My God, I'm not having this\Nconversation with you. Audrey, you can't go. This is not fair. Fair? Okay, let's define fair. Last\Nnight a 5-year-old boy was crushed because his father lied to him\Nabout coming to his birthday party. Fair?\NLast night... Was none of my business.\NThank you. None of my business. Two years ago, it was my business.\NBut I don't have to care anymore. That's the magic of divorce.\NBut it matters to Max! Everything you do matters,\Nand everything you don't do. All right. Now let me\Ntell you something. I'm a bad father! I mean... I'm a bad father. You're not a bad father,\Nwhen you show up. What if I come right\Nafter court and play ball? Then you and I can talk before\Nyou make any rash decisions! No, we are leaving tonight. Please, Audrey.\NGive me one more chance. I'm throwing myself\Non the mercy of the court. I lost you, but please\Ndon't make me lose Max, too. Give me a chance to be the\Nfather I started out to be. You're really coming? This is ironclad. This is the mother of\Nall promises. What time? Okay, 6:00. 5:50. All right. All right. But if I tell Max\Nthat you're coming, and you don't show up and I have\Nto see that look on his face, that heartbreaking look, we're going to Boston. If I don't show up,\NI'll pack you myself. I will lovingly wrap your\Nnicknacks with bubble paper. I hope so. Do you know what your son\Nwas doing at Ā·:15 last night? He was making a birthday wish\Nthat for just one day his father couldn't\Ntell a lie. Oh, my God! That's it! "I do not like them, Sam I Am. "I do not like green eggs\Nand ham. "Would you like them here\Nor there? "I would not like them... " Excuse me. Hi. I'm Max's bad father...\NI'm his father. Dad! Could I borrow him\Nfor just one second? Monster Max! You came to play catch? I'd like to, but I can't.\NI gotta talk to you. Your mommy told me about that wish\Nyou made last night. It came true, Max. Really? You mean you\Nhave to tell the truth? Yes. No matter what?\NNo matter what! Is wrestling real? In the Olympics, yes.\NOn channel 23, no. Will sitting too close to\Nthe TV set make me go blind? Not in a million years. If I keep making this face,\Nwill it get stuck that way? Uh-uh. In fact some people\Nmake a good living that way. Now listen, Max. You've\Ngotta do something for me. I need you to\Ntake back that wish. So you can lie? Yes. But not to you.\NYou see, Max, sometimes grownups\Nneed to lie. It's hard to explain,\Nbut if... Look, here's a good example. When your mommy was pregnant\Nwith you, she gained 40 pounds, there was nothing\Nshe wouldn't eat. And Daddy was scared. But when\Nshe'd ask me, "How do I look?" I'd say, "Honey, you look\Ngreat. You're glowing. " If I had told Mommy\Nshe looked like a cow, it would have\Nhurt her feelings. Understand? My teacher tells me\Nreal beauty's on the inside. That's just something\Nugly people say. Max, no one can\Nsurvive in the adult world if they have to\Nstick to the truth. I could lose my case,\NI could lose my promotion, I could even lose my job. Now, I need your help, Max. Okay. Okay. Do whatever\Nyou did last night, only this time,\Nmake it an "unwish". I did it. Excellent! Now, I just need\Na little test. Did it work? Not like I'd hoped.\NDid you unwish it? Only... What? Only what? Yesterday, when I wished it,\NI really meant it. This time when I unwished it, I\Nonly did it 'cause you told me to. All right. Do it again.\NAnd this time, mean it. But I can't! Why not? 'Cause I don't\Nwant you to lie. I explained this. I have to lie.\NEverybody lies. Mommy lies.\NEven the wonderful Jerry lies. But you're the only one\Nthat makes me feel bad. Max, recess is over.\NCome on in! Mom says we're\Nmoving to Boston. That isn't for sure yet. She promised\Nwe'd talk about it tonight. I am coming! You believe me,\Ndon't you, Max? I'll see you later, buddy. Fletcher. How's it hanging? Short, shriveled\Nand always to the left. Boss, it's Skull.\NHe knocked over another ATM. This time at knife-point.\NHe needs your legal advice. Stop breaking the law,\Nasshole! Boss, are you all right? My son hates me. Max loves you. I've seen you\Ntogether. You're his hero. Oh, yeah? Last night at his birthday\Nparty, he made a wish that I wouldn't be able to lie\Nfor one whole day. Kids. It came true. What?\NMax's wish! It came true. Boss, maybe you should\Njust take a few days off. Greta! Didn't it seem weird to you that\NI kept telling the truth all morning? Well, yeah. But... What are you saying? That\Nyou are incapable of lying? That's right!\NI am incapable of lying! Just for today? Apparently.\N'Til 8·:15 tonight. It's one of those\N24-hour curses. Those are going around. You don't believe me, do you? Of course not. How ironic! Okay. Ask me something you\Nthink I would normally lie about. All right. Remember a couple of\Nmonths ago when I wanted a raise? I don't want to do this. And\Nthe company wouldn't give me one and I asked if you would give\Nit to me out of your own pocket. And you said the company\Nwould not allow it, because it would create jealousy\Namong the other secretaries. Was that true, or did you just\Nnot want to pony up the dough? Greta, please! Judge Stevens, hi! Fletcher Reede. I'm\Nscheduled in your court in half an hour. Judge Stevens, I badly,\Nbadly need a continuance. Ill? Am I ill? That is the perfect\Nquestion for you to ask. Please lie for me! I remember when you bought me this antique frame from\NTiffany's... Tiffany's? Garage sale. $6.50,\Nmarked down from ten. I'll give you the raise! Here's your raise. Hi, Judge Stevens! I know I\Nhaven't given you an answer. But illness could mean\Nso many things. Can you hold?\NHello? Mom! Hi! I wasn't really\Non vacation. Because I didn't\Nwant to talk to you! Because you insist on talking about Dad's\Nbowel movements, size, color, frequency! I'll call you later! Hello? Oh, damn it! I cut him off. I cut off the judge! Greta! Don't leave! I'm on my knees\Nin a $000 suit! Mr. Reede. Several years ago, a\Nfriend had a burglar on her roof. He fell through the skylight, landed\Non a butcher's knife, cutting his leg. The burglar sued my friend.\NHe sued my friend! Because of guys like you,\Nhe won! My friend had to pay the\Nburglar $6,000. Is that justice? No.\NI'd have got him $10,000. Goodbye, Mr. Reede. No, wait! I didn't understand!\NAsk me again! Have a nice day in court. Greta! Hi.\NGod in heaven! It's nice to see you too,\NFletcher. Are you busy? Extremely. Good. Would you\Nfollow me, please? Did you know\Nthat the partnership committee is headed by\NMr. Allan himself? You used to work directly\Nfor Mr. Allan. Yeah. Tell me.\NWhat do you think of him? He's a pedantic, pontificating,\Npretentious bastard! A belligerent old fart! A steaming pile of cow dung!\NFiguratively speaking. Really? How delightful.\NThis way. Pardon me for interrupting. Mr.\NAllan, you remember Fletcher Reede? Oh, yes! Nice to\Nsee you again, Fletcher. I'll be observing you\Nin court this afternoon. I've been hearing\Nsome good things about you. Well, Fletcher has just been\Ntelling me how much he thinks of you. Why don't you tell Mr. Allan?\NWell, what do you think of him? He's a pedantic, pontificating,\Npretentious bastard! A belligerent old fart. A\Nworthless, steaming pile of cow dung. Figuratively speaking. That's the funniest damn thing\NI've ever heard! You're a real card, Reede! I love a good roast! Do Simmons! Simmons is old! He should have been\Nout years ago, but he can't stay home\N'cause he hates his wife! You've met her\Nat the Christmas parties. She's the one that gets\Nplastered and calls him a retard. And you, Tom. You're the\Nbiggest brownnose I've ever seen! You've got your head so far\Nup Mr. Allan's ass, I can't tell where\Nyou end and he begins! Priceless! You have bad breath\Ncaused by gingivitis. You couldn't get\Na porn star off. Your hairpiece looks like\Nsomething that was killed. I don't know whether to comb it or\Nscrape it off and bury it in lime! Loser! Idiot! Wimp!\NDegenerate! Slut! I like your style, Reede! That's\Nwhat this stuffy company needs! A little irreverence! Good! I'll see you later,\Ndick-head! Dick-head! Priceless! Keep your eye on that boy. Dick-head! Third District Court\Nis now in session. The honorable Judge\NMarshall Stevens presiding. Afternoon, Counselors. Are we ready to begin? No, sir! We are not ready to begin\Nbecause my client has not arrived! Hurry up!\NMove it, move it! Here she comes\Nto wreck the day Mr. Reede! Sorry, Your Honor. Go, go, go. Lupe, you keep those kids\Nquiet. I'm not even close to kidding. Sorry. Billy threw up\Nin the car. You brought your kids\Nto your divorce? Sympathy.\NWell, it's working. I feel sorry for them already. Miss Appleton,\Nyou may begin. From March 6 through June 12 I surveilled Mrs. Cole\Nat the behest of Mr. Cole. During that period, I noted that Mr.\NCole left each day between 7:40 and 7:50. Thereafter Mrs. Cole\Nwould frequently have a male visitor arrive and stay\Nfrom one to four hours. I was able to take several\Nphotographs of the male visitor. I see. Do you know what Mrs. Cole\Nand her male visitor did during these frequent visits? Well, they were pretty good\Nabout keeping the shades drawn, but I was able to make a\Nrecording of one such session. Your Honor, as you are aware, under\Nthe terms of the prenuptial agreement, if Mrs. Cole commits adultery,\Nshe is entitled to nothing. With your permission, we'd like to\Nplay the following tape recording. Here comes big daddy! Ohh, God! Do it to me! Do it to me! Harder! Harder! Oh, come on! Your Honor,\Nhow can it be proved that the male voice on that\Ntape is not Mr. Cole himself? You are such a better lover\Nthan my husband! Your Honor, I object! And why is that, Mr. Reede? It's devastating to my case! Overruled. Good call! I gotta go.\NI haven't cleaned your pool. Your witness. All right. Well, Mr. Reede,\Nyou may proceed. How? Your Honor, would the court be willing\Nto grant me a short bathroom break? Can't it wait? Yes, it can. But I've heard that if you hold it,\Nit can damage the prostate gland, making it very difficult\Nto get an erection! Is that true? It has to be. Well, in that case, I better\Ntake a little break myself. But you get back here\Nimmediately so we can finish this. How am I going to\Nget out of this? Think. Think. Think! What the hell are you doing? I'm kicking my ass!\NDo you mind? I found him like this\Nin the bathroom, Your Honor. Somebody beat\Nthe hell out of him. Who did this? A madman,\NYour Honor! A desperate fool at the end\Nof his pitiful rope! What did he look like? About 6'2", 180 pounds,\Nbig teeth, kind of gangly. Bailiff, have the deputy\Nsearch the building. Yes, sir. Order! Order! Under the circumstances, I have\Nno choice but to recess this case until 0:00 a. m.\Ntomorrow morning. Unless, of course, you\Nfeel you can still proceed. Can you? Yes, I can. I admire your courage,\NMr. Reede. We'll take a short recess so\Nthat you can compose yourself, and then we'll get started. Here you go. Hello?\NDad? Max? How's it going? Great. You know Paul and\NEmanuel from across the street? Yeah. Well, they never want\Nto play baseball with me. But I told them I'm\Nplaying tonight with my dad. So now they want to play.\NIs that okay? Sure. The more the merrier. Coolest! Do you\Nwanna be Jose Canseco? Oh, yeah. Who else is gonna\Nhit that famous Nomo slider? Mr. Reede. I gotta go now, Max. I'll see you in a\Ncouple hours. Okay? Bye. Bye, Dad. He's really coming!\NI'm gonna go change. Okay, go ahead! Yeah! Mr. Reede! "Mr. Reede! Mr... " This is my lawyer.\NHe's a little unorthodox. Mr. Reede, you remember Kenneth\NFalk, the man from the tape. How could I forget? Hey, how you doing? I've slipped into the seventh\Ncircle of hell! Thank you. You? Shouldn't we be going over\Nour testimony right now? Basically, the plan is,\NI walk you through the tape. Step-by-step,\NI ask you questions. And we give the explanation\Nyou came up with. Exactly. All we gotta do is lie.\NThat sounds simple enough. Doesn't it! Then I'll finish up\Nwith dramatic questions. Something like, "Mr. Falk, isn't it true that you\Nand Mrs. Cole have never made... " Oh, God!\NI can't do it. I can't finish the question\Nif I know the answer is a lie. You may proceed, Mr. Reede. Respondent calls... Kenneth Falk. Raise your right hand. Do you swear\Nto tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing\Nbut the truth, so help you God? I do! I mean... I do. Mr. Falk. Do you know my client,\NSamantha Cole? Yes. Isn't it true that your relationship\Nwith my client is entirely platonic? I object, Your Honor! To yourself? Yeah. But I would like to\Nrephrase the question. Mr. Falk, would I be accurate if I described your relationship with\NMrs. Cole as totally professional? I object, Your Honor,\Nand I move to strike! Mr. Reede, I don't know what you're on,\Nbut you better get to the point and quick. Thank you, sir. Is your relationship with\Nmy client entirely platonic? Not! Is not your\Nrelationship with my client, "Boink! Bad baby, bad baby!" Did you ever not make... Did you... Mr. Reede! You had sex with her every time you\Nmet, didn't you? Didn't you! Liar! He's badgering the witness. It's his witness. You slammed her! You dunked her\Ndonuts! You gave her dog a Snausage! You stuffed her like\Na Thanksgiving turkey! All right, it's true, okay!\NI humped her brains out! There! Now you happy? No further questions. No questions. You may step down. Do I dare ask you to\Ncall your next witness? I have no further witnesses,\NYour Honor. What are you doing?\NCall me! You do not understand.\NI can't lie. I can't do anything dishonest\Nuntil Ā·:15 tonight! Listen, you bastard!\NI want my money! I am not going to end up a\N31-year-old divorcee on welfare because my scumbag attorney had\Na sudden attack of conscience! Thirty-one? If Mr. Reede has\Nno further witnesses, then I have no choice\Nbut to rule in favor of... Your Honor! I call Samantha Cole\Nto the stand. Order. Order! Order! Knock it off! Sit down! Mr. Reede, it is out\Nof sheer morbid curiosity I'm allowing this\Nfreak show to continue. Mrs. Cole if you dare. Mrs. Cole, is this a copy of\Nyour driver's license? Yes. It says here you're a blond.\NAre you? If you don't remember,\Nperhaps Mr. Falk will. Brunette. We can play the tape again.\NMaybe it's on there. I'm a brunette! Thank you.\NNow let's see. "Weight, 105."\NYeah! In your bra. Your Honor, I object!\NYou would! Bastard!\NHag! Quiet! Overruled! Weight? 118. All right, fine, fine.\NI'm 127. And it says here you were born in\N1064, but that's not true either, is it? Is it!\NNo. Will you tell me what it says here on your\Nbirth certificate under "Date of birth"? Your Honor, what does this\Nhave to do with anything? Overruled. Mrs. Cole,\Nanswer the question. "1065." Now let me get this straight. That would mean that you lied about\Nyour age to make yourself older. But why would any woman\Nwant to do that? I changed it\Nso I could get married. And the truth\Nshall set you free! My client lied about her age! She was only 17 when she got\Nmarried, which makes her a minor, and in the great state\Nof California, no minor can enter into any legal contract\Nwithout parental consent, including... Prenuptial agreements. Prenuptial agreements!\NThis contract is void! The fact that my client has been ridden\Nmore than Seattle Slew is irrelevant. Standard Community Property\Napplies, and she is entitled\Nto half of the marital assets, or $11.305 million! Jordan fades back. Swoosh!\NAnd that's the game! Nothing further,\NYour Honor. Order. Order. Order! In light of this new evidence, the\Ncourt must rule in favor of Mrs. Cole. Yes! She is hereby awarded\Nhalf the marital assets. The son of a bitch\Npulled it off! I didn't know! It doesn't matter.\NThe contract's void. Order. Order. I understand both parties\Nhave agreed to joint custody. Is that correct?\NYes. Yes.\NNo. I'm contesting custody. What? If I get sole custody, that's another 10 grand\Nin child support payments. You just won $11 million! Hey, I'm the victim here.\NYou said it yourself. Now I'm gonna hit him\Nwhere it hurts. But you... You said\Nhe was a good father. So? Well, Mr. Reede, do we have\Nan agreement on custody or not? No. I see. In that case, there will be a custody\Nhearing on the 10th at 0:00 a. m. Court is adjourned. Come on, let's go. Daddy! You stop that whining, or I'll\Ngive you something to whine about! I wanna go with Daddy! Come here, kids. Come on. It's\Nall right. Don't you worry. I promise we'll be together,\Nwhatever I have to do. It's okay. It's okay. Oh, for God's sake, will you\Ngive me those? They're mine! Let go of Daddy! Let go\Nof him! Let go of Daddy! We're leaving now!\NLupe, come on! Don't you have some checks to\Nwrite? You haven't paid for them yet. I love children. They give you so much\Nleverage in a case like this. You did an incredible job,\Npartner. Look at him. He's stunned.\NHe can't believe it. Your Honor, may I please\Napproach the bench? We're adjourned,\NMr. Reede. Your Honor, I think\Nwe've made a big mistake. Mr. Reede,\NI am tired and very cranky. I know, but this is\Njust... wrong, isn't it? I manipulated the system. Just because you bought it doesn't\Nmean I'm right. It's a technicality! Young man, having my judgment\Nmocked in my own court is not something\NI'm prepared to tolerate! Well, tell that to the kids when\Nthey're adopted by the Manson family! One more word out of you, Mr.\NReede, and I'll hold you in contempt! I hold myself in contempt! Why should you\Nbe any different? Bailiff, take him away! This man is a good father,\Nand children are not leverage! Oh, no, don't do this! I have\Na date to play ball with my son! I can't be late!\NIt's my last chance! I'm Jose Canseco! Phone call!\NPhone call! I get a phone call!\NI get a phone call! I get a phone call! Hello? Audrey, it's me.\NDon't hang up! I can't talk right now.\NOur flight leaves at Ā·:00. What? I'm taking Max someplace where\Nyou can't do this anymore. Audrey, wait! The most amazing\Nthing has happened to me. I'm a changed man! Just come to the courthouse\Nwith $1,000 and bail me out. Hello? Hello? Time's up, pal. No, just one\Nmore call. Just one more call. Okay, let's go. Ready?\NYeah. Will you get the door, please? Okay. Thank you. Mr. Reede, you made bail. Greta! Oh, thank God! Am I too late? Have you\Nbeen sexually molested yet? Because I could\Ncircle the block. How did you know\NI was here? One of the other secretaries\Ncalled me at home, said you went all noble\Nin front of Mr. Allan. Yeah, I think I'm fired.\NIsn't that great? I'll start my own firm.\NDo you need a job? I don't think\Nyou can afford me. Oh, man, I gotta get my car.\NAudrey's on her way to the airport. I could lose Max forever. I\Ncan't let that happen. I love him! You know, this truth stuff\Nis pretty cool. I love my son!\NI love my son! I love my son!\NI love my son! Hey, need some change?\NTake everything! But it's not gonna\Nmake you happy. I love my son! Hey, there you are! Hi.\NJust in time. Oh, this is the happiest\Nmoment of my entire life. Well, me... Mine...\NWell, ours... also. Hey, gipper. I have\Nsomething for you, young man. Watch yourself.\NIt's the claw! The claw's coming at you. You're scared of the claw.\NYou're scared of the claw. Jerry. Jerry. Huh? It's okay.\NYou don't have to... Tower Air Flight 1511\Nto Boston is now boarding. That's us.\NYeah. Ready to go? Yes. You ready? Okay.\NGreat. Jim Rubing, please report\Nto Airport Security. Excuse me! What gate is flight 1511\Nleaving from? It's an emergency! Gate number 123, but you'll never\Nmake it. Flight's already boarding. It takes more than a half hour\Nto get through security. If you want to go to Boston, there's another flight leaving\Ntomorrow morning at 7:00 a. m. Flight number 12... Ladies and gentlemen,\Nwelcome aboard Flight 1511 from Los Angeles\Nto Boston's Logan Airport. We'll be departing shortly, and if you need help stowing\Nyour carry-on items... Honey, can I help you?\NI'm fine. Are you sure?\NJerry, I can open the bag! Would you like anything\Nto drink before takeoff? Yes. Anything with alcohol,\Nplease. Audrey. If you'll focus on the screen,\Nwe'll be running a safety video. How about that drink? Max! Max! Max! Wait! That ought to do it. Hey! Thanks! It's running great! Max! Hey! Max! Hey! Max! I'm coming! Max! Max! Max, where are you? I love you. Thank you. That wasn't exactly\Nthe answer I was looking for. Thank you very much? I'm sorry.\NIt's just... Too fast? It was too fast, wasn't it? No, it's... Chemistry? Whatever it is,\Nwe can work on it. No, no, no.\NIt's just that... Oh, my God, it's Fletcher! No, no, this has nothing\Nto do with Fletcher. No, honey, it's Fletcher. What? Dad? I made it! I'm late,\Nbut I made it! What is he doing? He came to see us off.\NWave. I won't let you go! Oh, shit! Control one-nine, this is Tower\N1511, heavy. Ready for takeoff. Hey! What was that? Looked like a shoe. Pull over! Pull this thing over! Control one-nine, some idiot\Nhas hijacked a flight of stairs. We're gonna stop this plane. One-nine Control. We copy. Yeah! No! You people are all\Ndoing a wonderful job! That's far enough, folks. He's my husband.\NWas my husband. All right, go ahead.\NOkay. Max, you stay here with Jerry,\Nand I'll be right back, okay? Audrey! Great news!\NFletcher! Both my legs are broken, so\Nthey can't take me right to jail. Fletcher, what were you doing?\NAre you out of your mind? No, I'm thinking clear.\NI've never been this clear! Dad? Creep. He was getting kind of upset. Are you all right? Yeah. I'm hurting here,\Nthough. I'm a dope, Max. All this time you've been here and I\Ncould see you anytime, but I didn't. Then your mom told me\Nyou were moving to Boston, and I started thinking. I could be sitting around\Nsometime and want to look at you and hold you\Nand play with you, and I won't be able to. I don't think I'm gonna\Ndo too well with that. I love you more than anything\Nelse in the world, Max, and you know it's true. I couldn't say it if it\Nwasn't true. Not today. I love you,\Nand I'll never hurt you again. He's telling the truth, Mom.\NHe's not allowed to lie. I made a wish, and anything Dad\Nsays today has to be the truth. Max. It's Ā·:45. You made the wish at Ā·:15. I've been able to lie\Nfor the last half hour. So you weren't... No, it was the truth! I just wanted to be honest with you.\NI always want to be honest with you. Mom, do we have to\Ngo to Boston? No, Max,\Nyou don't have to go. Yeah! I, on the other hand,\Ndo have to. A hospital to run. That's an open-ended ticket\Nif you ever change your mind. Thank you. Looks like\Nhe's got his father back. Happy birthday, dear Maximus Happy birthday to you Okay, Max,\Nmake a wish. Wait! I don't know\Nif we should do this. Oh, Fletcher, come on. What are\Nthe odds of that happening again? Yeah, I guess you're right. Okay, Max, go ahead. Mom? Dad? Max! Did you wish for your mom and\NI to get back together again? No, I wished for Rollerblades. Do you want to\Ncut the cake, Dad? I'd love to. But I have this horrible pain\Nin my arm. Oh, no, it's the claw! No one can stop the claw! No one can stop it! Nothing can stop the claw! If I was a boxer, I would bounce\Nthose things like Sugar Ray Leonard. I'm sorry. Brought your kids\Nto your divorce? Sympathy.\NWell, it's working. I feel sorry for them already. For this you will\Npay a terrible price. Well, it's working!\NI feel sorry for them already. Mrs. Cole. A goose. Including... Prenuptial agreements. No. I'd have got him $10,000. Goodbye, Mr. Reede.\NNo, wait! I didn't know she had... Oh, shit. Now, let's see.\N"Weight, 105"? Yeah! In your bra. Your Honor, I object!\NYou would! Overactor! Jezebel! He put me up to it. Yeah, sure he did. Oh, no.\NThey're onto me.
