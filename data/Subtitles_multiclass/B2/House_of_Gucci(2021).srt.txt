Patrizia, how come I've never\Nseen you before? You weren't looking\Nhard enough. I would have noticed\Nthat Bianca was friends\Nwith Elizabeth Taylor. I can assure you... I'm way more fun.

[Patrizia chuckles] Father, I would like to introduce\Nyou to Patrizia Reggiani. Patrizia, this is my\Nfather, Rodolfo. Delighted to meet you. I trust Adele has been\Nkeeping you amused. Picasso? No. No, no. No, it's Klimt. How silly of me. Oh, no, no, no. It's an easy mistake.\NI've made worse myself. Must be worth a fortune. [all laughing] Yes. But you know, to me, art,\Nlike beauty, has no price. I made a reservation for us\Nat the Gallia. Perfect choice. [indistinct chatter] [Rodolfo] So Patrizia... What... What exactly\Nare your interests? I'm a very social person. Are you? - A people pleaser.\N- Oh. And, do you study? I work for\Nmy father's business. [Rodolfo] Ah. And his business is? Ground transportation. Oh. Maurizio said\Nyou used to be an actor. Yes, I was. You may remember a film,\N<i>The Ancestor?</i> No, no, no. Of course. You're too young. But sometimes on the TV, they play a movie\N<i>Tourist Train.</i> - <i>Tourist Train</i> sounds familiar.\N- Yeah, well... Maybe you noticed a dashing young\Nactor, Maurizio D'Ancora. That would have been me. I didn't know I was sitting\Nwith a movie star. Can I get an autograph? [Rodolfo] Oh, no, no, no. The only good thing that came\Nfrom my career was meeting Maurizio's mother. Now she,\Nshe was a star. I remember at her funeral... during a moment of\Nsilent remembrance, Maurizio noticed the priest\Nlighting candles... and he began to sing\N"Happy Birthday." He turned, maybe\Nthe saddest moment of my life, into something... How do you say,\Nsomething sweet. That's my son. That is my dear boy. - <i>Grazie,</i> Franco.\N- Thank you, sir. Ah, Maurizio. I liked your Patrizia. Charming. Father, she really\Nliked you. Tell me,\Nwhere did you meet her? I met her at a party. [Rodolfo] Party? Yeah, Luca Sarzana's house.\NAt the Palazzo Serbelloni. [Rodolfo] Yes, I know\Nwhere the Sarzanas live. You know... there is a certain sort of\Nyoung woman... who makes their fortune from getting their hooks\Ninto someone like you. Well, yes, Father,\Nbut Patrizia is not like that. [Rodolfo] Well, I had Franco\Ndo a little investigation. I think\Nshe's after your money. Like they all are. The Reggianis... are truck drivers. Her father has\Na very successful transportation business. It is... It is an empire. Oh! A truck driving empire.\NHow many? - How many what?\N- How many trucks? Fifty? Five hundred? What does he transport,\Ngarbage? Huh? Mafia! [coughing] Oh... Listen, I've... I give you everything. I give you this house,\NI give you money. You have a life. You... What is it you want? What I want is to marry her. Live with her. Fuck her. Have a good time with her.\NDo what you want. Go away on holiday.\NGo to Sardinia. But, no, not marry. No, don't walk away. Okay, listen to yourself. You're so bitter\Nand you don't even realize it. Who cares\Nwhat her family name is, or how many trucks\Nthey have. You hide here in the past and you expect me\Nto hide here with you? Not anymore! These are your ghosts. These are your ghosts,\Nnot mine. These are your regrets. Don't do this to me. You can't stop it. I can, I will. I will...\NI cut you from my will. I'll leave you with nothing. That's fine. I love her. [Rodolfo]\NYou're making a big mistake. Oh, she's fine,\Nbut, you know, she's a...\NShe's just a... I love what she is. [doorbell rings] <i>Si?</i> <i>Commendatore</i> Reggiani,\Nmy name is Maurizio Gucci. - [woman] Patrizia!\N- [Patrizia] Uh-huh? [woman speaks\Nin other lanugage] I have had a disagreement\Nwith my father that has forced me to leave my\Nhome and my family business. I am still in school. I'm studying to be a lawyer,\Nso as of this moment I do not have a job, but I... [speaks Italian] But I'm in love\Nwith your daughter. And I would like to marry her.

We have history flowing through\Nthese green and red webbings. And yes, we are expensive. But quality is remembered\Nlong after price is forgotten. Huh? Thoughts on Paolo's outfit,\NDomenico? You're the fashionista. It's eccentric. I designed this myself. Well, you should reconsider\Nyour wardrobe choices, Paolo. You are Gucci,\Nyou need to dress the part. It's chic. My father's problem is that\Nhe's stuck in the past. He refuses to take Gucci\Ninto the next century. - [Aldo] Yes, Gucci is doing fine under my watch.\N- [Paolo] No! - No, don't worry about it.\N- Oh, no! No. No. It needs new ideas. - New energy.\N- Of course. And I happen to be\Nbursting with creativity. - Yes, yes.\N- Yes, my bladder may be full... but my dreams are even fuller.

Okay? - <i>Ciao,</i> Aldo.\N- <i>Ciao!</i> - <i>Ciao.</i>\N- [laughs] [bidding farewell in Italian] Oh, it's good to see you. I couldn't believe\Nyou got into the car. How did you do that? [Maurizio] It's all bullshit. We're not royalty. My grandfather Guccio was\Na bellhop in London. That's where he got the idea\Nfor leather goods. By carrying bags around\Nfor rich aristocrats. Gucci is like that cake. What? Once you think there's enough\Nto go around... then you'll have a taste,\Nand then you'll want more... and then you'll want\Nthe whole thing for yourself. What about you? You just gonna sit around\Nand watch them eat everything? Me? I am Gucci by name. I don't have\Ntheir Tuscan character. It was diluted by\Nmy mother's German blood. The only wedding gift\Nthe Guccis gave us. Coupons. Feels like cash. I doubt it. It's not cash. Fucking Concorde. To where? New York. New York. Ah, Patrizia. We can't drive to New York,\Nwe have to fly. You wanna go to New York? No. Everybody likes New York. I don't. I wanna go to New York. [gasps] New York. I love New York. What are you doing?

"Havana Libre." Lots of pastels. Rum inspired, sun-soaked\Nand lots of browns. You have pastels\Nand brown together. Yes, yes, yes. I know, it's musical. Paolo. Yeah. You must not show these\Nto anyone. Keep them hidden. I mean it. You feel they might steal\Nmy ideas, right? Oh, call me a lawyer. Not you.

Well, you could\Nsell your shares. [Maurizio] To who? - I can think of a few qualified individuals.\N- Thank you. Leave them with us. We'll review them\Nas soon as we're done mourning.

Well, you know what else\Nwould surprise you? How profitable this stuff is. What about quality? Your sacred cows? [Aldo] Quality is for the rich. If a Long Island housewife\Nwants to... live with the illusion that\Nshe is a Gucci customer... why not? Let her. Because it damages\NGucci's credibility. Patrizia, this is us. This is not a girl's game. [Maurizio] Yeah, but, Aldo,\Nshe's right. This stuff is junk. It's not what Gucci is. Gucci... is what I say it is. I turned it into an empire. Not Rodolfo. Certainly not my son. And, uh... of course, not you, so... Without me... you'd all still be\Nshoveling cow shit in Tuscany. That's a fact. Remember that. We should remember that. [upbeat music playing] <i>Brava!</i> [woman] Bravo! Bravo! [audience cheering] A martini, please. [bartender] Yes, sir. Did you like the show? Oh, it was incredible. The... The...\NThe lines and tones. Well, what's your name? My name? Maurizio. Maurizio what? Maurizio Gucci. Maurizio Gucci.\NHow about that? Gucci. You know, I used to\Ndress windows for Gucci. Oh, really? Which store? I can't remember. It was... It was God-awful though. Walter, by the way. I'm a designer. Okay, Walter. Well, maybe you will design\Nfor me someday. No. No designer here's gonna\Nwork for Gucci. Right now, Gucci... Gucci's just a cheap operetta. - <i>Grazia.</i>\N- <i>Salud.</i> Well, enjoy yourself. Do you want to be left\Nin the dust? You want to keep selling\Ncoffee mugs in airports? Is that your legacy? It's time to\Ntake out the trash. Aldo and Paolo, they're poison. They're an embarrassment\Nto this company... and everybody knows it. They have to go. And you need to get your\Nfucking business organized. [Maurizio] Patrizia... they're my family. [exhales] So am I. He's starting a trade war. Paolo barely has enough\Nto bankroll a pair of socks, let alone start a war\Nwith anyone. I don't want to see it. [Domenico] Yes, but he could\Nstill be a problem. Aldo has awarded him a number\Nof shares in the company. Yes, but Aldo didn't realize\Nwhat an idiot Paolo turned out to be. Maurizio, we need\Nto build a bridge with Paolo and work things out. You know how emotional he gets. He's around all this\Nmale energy all the time. His wife isn't exactly\Nthe brightest. He needs someone\Nhe can talk to, who he trusts,\Nwho listens to him. Someone like who? [laughs] - Paolo likes me.\N- [Domenico scoffs] You do have\Na natural advantage. You are not a Gucci. I... I need an espresso. Can I ask you a question? You just did. Huh? You just asked me a question. And what you really\Nwant to know is whether you can ask me\Ntwo questions, one of which\Nyou've already asked. [laughing] That's good.\NDomenico, very funny. Okay, here is\Nmy second question. What do you see as being\Nyour purpose at Gucci? Is this a job interview? Maybe. I'm a conservationist. Gucci is a rare animal.\NIt must be protected. Protected from who? From whoever threatens it. I find it very interesting that you have such\Na strong connection to that which is not yours. Uh... Sometimes it takes an outsider\Nto see the truth. <i>Bravo.</i> Paolo, this one reminds me\Nof childhood. Yeah, well, it's a memory\Nwrapped in lycra. It's just so you.\NIt's exquisite. Do you think so? You have a gift,\NI'm telling you. Oh, well, stop. Stop, you're going\Nto make me... you're going to make me cry. Nobody has ever\Nsaid that to me. Nobody. Paolo, why don't you have\Nyour own line? These are just mock-ups. I can't afford to get serious. With your gift,\Nand your talent, and your vision... Are you kidding? Gucci needs new blood. Goodbye 1930s. Hello, '80s. Huh? Oh, you took the words\Nright out of my guts. - Paolo Gucci is coming.\N- [Paolo scatting] Come on. [continues scatting] [groans] [sighs] I'm disgusted by the way\Nyour father treats you. [sighs] Leaving you behind\Nto groom Maurizio. It's not right. Who does he think he is? Well, a dinosaur posing\Nas a butthole. [chuckles] [laughing] You were a comedian\Nin a past life. [Paolo wheezing] Maurizio likes you. - [Paolo] Ah...\N- He always has. Well, I like my cousin too. He's quiet like a...\Nlike a little mouse. Uh, tiny little mousy. Doesn't scream like the others. No, he doesn't. And you\Nand Maurizio together... That would be amazing. - That's a new chapter for Gucci.\N- [Paolo] No, no, no. My father,\Nhe would never allow it. He's got my little peaches\Nin a very tight grip. Paolo... maybe it's time... to respectfully... leave him behind. You are justified. I do have... something on my father. Can you keep a secret? Cross your heart\Nand hope to die. Father, Son,\Nand House of Gucci. [Paolo] Okay. Okay. Well, you know... [Patrizia] You don't\Nhave to tell me. - Listen...\N- It's just... I can come back any time.\NWe can talk about your designs. But what would I get\Nout of this? We could offer you\Nan exclusive deal to distribute your own line\Nunder Gucci. I should talk to Maurizio. [Maurizio] <i>You talked to him?</i> When? [thunder rumbling] Today. He showed me his designs. Why didn't you tell me? [Patrizia] I'm telling you now,\Naren't I? [sputters] Patrizia,\Nthat's not the point. Don't focus on the process,\Nfocus on the result. I told him... we'd distribute\Nhis clothing line under Gucci\Nand he committed to a deal. Maurizio, those designs\Nwon't see the light of day. We need Paolo on our side. What game are you playing? I'm looking out\Nfor our best interests. Is that a game? [rain pattering] [thunder rumbling] [beeps] [Paolo exclaims] Mau, Mau! Thank you for coming. You thought I lost my touch. No, not yet. [Maurizio] <i>Ciao,</i> Paolo. You sounded urgent,\Nso I came right away. Very well. I got these from three\Nof his ex "secretaries." He's not exactly\Na favorite among the ex's. In fact,\Nthey all hate his guts. Gucci is a very black hole\Nof undeclared income. Paolo, this is fraud... on a global scale. In Italy taxes are okay,\Nbut in America... it is very different. We should keep this\Nto ourselves. [sputters] But we can use it... as leverage\Nto persuade him a bit. And with you... on my side... we have the majority we need for you to become your own man. And he won't get into\Nany real trouble, right? No. [sputters] At this point... worst case scenario,\Nhe pays his taxes. They slap his wrists. Happens all the time. But more importantly,\Nhe would see you. He would see you. [sighs] I could finally soar... [exhales] like a pigeon. [Paolo] I'm tired of being\Nheld back. Father, I'm tired\Nof being held back. I'm serious. I'm serious. I'm tired of being held back. I want freedom. I'm serious. No, I'm serious. <i>Hello?</i> <i>Hello?</i> - Yeah. The...\N- [Paolo] <i>Hello, can you hear me?</i> No, it's a terrible line,\Nand I... [Paolo] <i>Can you hear me now?</i> - <i>I can call you back.</i>\N- No, no. It's midnight. <i>It's late here. Just tell me\Nwhat's on your mind.</i> <i>What happened?</i> I, uh... I want my freedom. I'm tired of being held back. I'm serious. [Aldo] <i>Freedom?</i> Uh... Paolo,\Nplease just wait till tomorrow. I'll talk to you about it\Ntomorrow, all right? I'm busy here. I have your tax filings. Taxes? What are\Nyou talking about? - <i>That's it, Paolo.</i>\N- I don't want to expose you, Father. I'll talk to you tomorrow.\NGo to bed. - <i>You need to go to bed, Paolo.

I heard the way you spoke\Nto me at lunch. He's not the problem? [Maurizio] I was tired. Next time, don't embarrass\Nme in front of those people. Those people\Nare friends of mine. I've known most of them\Nlonger than you. He is the problem. Say it! Patrizia, I was tired.\NI'm tired. Then wake yourself up\Nand say it. [Maurizio] Okay. When you make me\Nsneak around my own family. When you set father and son\Nagainst each other... and me against Paolo. When you second-guess a person\Nlike Domenico De Sole... the only person\Nmy father trusted. These things have an effect on the\Nenvironment I operate in. On me. Actions have consequences. [Patrizia] I did that for you.\NI was being constructive. I'm not gonna apologize\Nfor that. No thanks. My uncle is in prison and\Nmy cousin thinks I'm scum. And you think\Nthat's constructive? Don't pin Gucci's problems\Non me, okay? I'm just here mopping up\Nyour fucking mess. I never asked for your help. Maurizio... we're only stronger together.

Would you like a cigarette? No. [thanking in Italian] You ever steal anything, Paola? What? Forgive me. I am trying to teach\NAlessandra... the importance of not touching\Nother people's belongings. I don't consider myself a\Nparticularly ethical person... but I am fair. What I cannot\Nwrap my head around... is people who steal\Njust for ego. Or the pleasure of it. For personal satisfaction. I'll have my maid\Ndrop off the strudel. Good to see you. [scoffs] [clock chiming] [clears throat] [Patrizia]\NDo you like my hair? Maurizio,\Ndo you like my hair? Oh, yes, very nice. Very chic.

He had a business in Paris. - He's lying and so are you.\N- Maurizio is very busy, Patrizia. He didn't even have the decency to\Ncome to his daughter's last recital. What kind of a father is he? There will be\Na new arrangement. And why did he send you, huh? Hey, Domenico,\Nwhy did he send you? What, you're his\Nlittle fucking messenger? He didn't have\Nthe decency to come here. He's too much of a coward\Nto do it himself? I have the papers right here. Papers? Ah, papers!\NI'm not signing any papers. You can tell him to come here and talk\Nto me like a fucking normal human being. Maurizio said you and Alessandra can\Ncontinue to live in the penthouse since it's no longer\Nhis primary residence. He's happy to extend payments until\Nyou're able to stand on your own two feet. - What are you talking about?\N- Please. What are you saying?\NWhat are you saying to me? Huh? - These are words, Domenico.\N- Support for Alessandra. - I'm not talking to you.\N- Shared custody. You come to my daughter's school.\NWhat the fuck is wrong with you? Shared custody.

To be able to finally sit down\Nwith a member of the dynasty. It's something\Nwe will cherish forever. And truly... I understand\Nhow difficult this is. Please don't patronize me. Please.

That shoe you showed me\Nbefore... take a look inside your shoe\Nand see at the heel. There's something\Nyou should see. I remember ordering\Na pair of those... for Clark Gable. 1953. Right before\Nhe did the film <i>Mogambo.</i> This is the rarest of shoes. You see that? You see that? It's a gold leaf. You know... I had to stop doing that. It got too expensive. So. Where did you get that shoe? Where? There's no way you bought\Nthat shoe in London. Who gave it to you? Would you know? My, he doesn't wanna answer. [Paolo]\NWell, that's the least...

[Maurizio] Ms. Wintour, walk into any one\Nof Gucci's 144 international boutiques and you will find you are\Nwalking into a new world. A new vision. But wasn't the lure of Gucci\Nprecisely its historical appeal? The legacy is remarkable. [Maurizio] Well, this is true. <i>We are products of our past but we\Ndon't have to be prisoners of it.</i> <i>I don't fear change.</i> <i>I embrace it.</i> Where Ralph Lauren stores,\Nthey feel like movie sets and Versace\Nis a rock concert, Gucci stores will feel\Nlike the Vatican of fashion. ["Ashes to Ashes" playing] <i>Grazie.</i> How are you funding\Nyour vision? - [Maurizio] Well, that is a very good secret.\N- [chuckles] Don't ask. It may take some time\Nto recover... but this is a long-term plan. <i>Sometimes you have to go down\Nto come back up again.</i> Ferre, Armani, and Versace! That's who I said I wanted\Ndesigning our new line. And they would be honored\Nto be working for us. De Sole,\Nwhere the fuck are they? Maurizio, they have\Ntheir own lines. They're their own bosses. I know they have... I've spoken to everybody.\NNobody wants to... Then you haven't tried\Nhard enough. There is someone. Maybe. Here. Who am I looking at? He's from Texas. A mechanic? Maybe you should meet him. [man] I see cranked up blacks. Jewel-tone velvet. And unconventional\Nstyling touches. Loafers, sans socks. I see pole dancers\Nflanking the runways. Female... and male, of course. I have a vocabulary that\Nwill allow you to expand. That's what the brand requires. That's where we need to head. Without sacrificing the family\Ncharacter of what this brand is. The family character\Nis the brand. I'm here to embellish.\NI'm here to resurrect. [chuckles] [Patrizia] Maurizio. Stop. Please,\Nplease, please. I'm begging you.\NPlease stop. Okay, I... I don't want\Na confrontation. Me neither. I tried calling. Yes, and calling\Nand calling and calling. What do you want? I want to talk. [Maurizio] Okay. Alessandra misses you. I saw Alessandra\Ntwo weeks ago. She talks about you\Nall the time. And I'll see her very soon.\NI've been very busy. Will you come back home? [distant dog barking] You bought Aldo and Paolo out.\NYou did what I said. Good night, Patrizia. [Patrizia] Come back home. Patrizia, you know that's...\Nthat's not possible. Now, it is getting very late. Go home. If not for me,\Njust for our daughter. [Maurizio] No, no, no.\NDon't do that. - Don't...\N- Don't... [Maurizio] I'll take\Ncare of her and you. - [bottle clinking]\N- [people chattering] We made something\Nbeautiful together. No, what? Take it. Do you like it? Patrizia, what is this? Do you like it? I made it for you. You're humiliating yourself. Why are you talking to me\Nthis way? Because you can't see\Nwhat you've become. This book... A story has\Na beginning and an end. And ours ended\Na few chapters ago. So, what do you want\Nfrom me now? I want you to myself. I love you. Patrizia... No. I don't love you. I don't hate you... but I don't want to spend\Nthe rest of my life with you. Now, I'm sorry. I truly am. What happened\Nto my Maurizio? Nothing. Absolutely nothing. I had no idea\NI married a monster. You didn't.\NYou married a Gucci. He's always away on business. - He moved, you know.\N- [Giuseppina] Hmm. [Giuseppina] Mmm-hmm. I've told you so many times. He moved into the penthouse\Nwith that fucking horse. I've seen them together. Maybe you should\Nstop following them. The things they buy... Antiques worth billions,\Ncars, paintings. With our money. [Giuseppina]\NThat he has thanks to you. He's not even a businessman. He can't even\Nrun a parking meter. How the fuck\Nis he gonna run Gucci? [Giuseppina] You're right. I know. I made him what he is. But when you're right,\Nyou're right. And you're very, very right. I'm gonna go see him tomorrow. Maybe you should wait until\Nwe come back from the Caymans. And then we can... we can do\Na nice evil eye on him. Hmm? Another spell? We've run out of spells. We need something stronger. Maybe I can still do something\Nthat will work. But for that,\Nyou have to be positive. I am being\Nvery fucking positive. [beeps] [Patrizia] <i>You are\Na waste of skin</i> <i>that belongs on the front\Npage of every newspaper.</i> [answering machine beeps] <i>I want the world to know\Nwhat you're really like.</i> <i>I will not give you\Na minute of peace.</i> [answering machine beeps] <i>You tried to crush me,\Nbut you couldn't.</i> [answering machine beeps] <i>You are a painful appendage\Nthat needs to be removed.</i> <i>The inferno for you\Nis yet to come.</i> [bird cawing] [greeting in Italian] Two, Rita. Where the fuck are they? If I knew how to use a pistol, I'd fucking do\Nthis shit myself. Calm down. Calm down. [Giuseppina]\NThey'll show up. Come sit. [car doors closing] - Thank you.\N- Enjoy. Pina. Yeah. Ivano, I told Patrizia that I know\Nyou since you were a child, huh. That we trust you. I am Ivano Savioni. This is my associate\NBenedetto Ceraulo. Who does what? Sicilian. How soon can you do it? As soon as\Nwe know his routine... and his security. And we are set on our rate. Our rate? What rate? - What is that?\N- You told me six. Yeah, yeah. - Are you crazy?\N- Why is he saying eight? - I don't what he's playing.\N- Why the fuck is he saying eight? - No, I don't know.\N- We said eight. - No, it's six. 600 million lire.\N- We said eight. That's it. What are you doing? Keep your fucking voice down. We said eight. - I'd consider it if only it was eight.\N- Yeah. Somebody else quoted me\Nfor far less. Six is all I'm willing to do. It will have to be\Na rush job then. Yeah. - And you have to provide us now with photographs.\N- [Patrizia] Uh-uh-uh. Six is all I will pay. We'll give you half now... half later when it's done. Okay. Okay. Don't miss. Deal with her. Really. You don't wanna\Nmake any mistakes. Catch. Pay for the coffee\Nand don't fuck this up. 'Cause I'll put a spell on you. [both chuckling] Ready. [upbeat music playing] [audience cheering] Wait. <i>♪ One, two, three, four ♪</i> That's amazing. I think he's incredible.\NLove him. <i>♪ One, two, three, four ♪</i> Are you sure\Nthis is a Gucci show? Yeah, yeah. Very nice, this jacket,\Nwe've talked about for months. It's beautiful. I love it. You're in for a surprise. [upbeat music continues] [audience exclaiming] <i>♪ One, two, three, four ♪</i> Very modern. Three, two, one. Go! [crowd cheering] He looks great. Bravo! Bravo! [Tom Ford] "When Tom Ford took over\Nthe creative reins of Gucci in 1994... "there was little hope for\Nthe Milanese fashion house." "It took a German designer\Nto stir up Chanel... "and it is an American who has put Gucci\Nfar and away in the front of fashion." "Some say Mr. Ford will give\NMr. Lagerfeld a run for his money." I have to call my mother\Nin Austin. [speaking other language]\NWatch what you say, he's here. What an unforgettable night. Maurizio. And the response\Nis incredible. I've never seen\Nanything like it. Indeed. It marks\Na new chapter for Gucci. Hey, try the carpaccio.\NIt melts in your mouth. Okay. [speaking other language]\NDon't say anything while I talk to him. I'll call on you when you can talk. I think we can all be honest with\Neach other around this table, yeah? We're all friends here. We can, we all\Nrespect each other. [Maurizio] <i>Grazie.</i> We're very concerned. What concerns you? Numbers. Specifically, Gucci's. Well, you said you didn't care\Nabout numbers. That you trusted your instinct. Yeah. I care about numbers\Nwhen they're terrible numbers. Our projections for 1996\Nare abysmal. By slashing hundreds of\Nprofitable items... You mean\Nmy uncle's knickknacks? [man] Losses are likely to total\N$30 million this year on sales of $180 million. Down from $210 million in 1991. And $270 million. There is $85 million\Nin bank debts. We may even have trouble paying\Nsalaries for the next couple of months. Profits remain elusive. And I've always said that our\Nstrategic plan would take five years. It's not about\Nimmediate profit. You go down\Nto come back up again. That is how you get out\Nof a stall. But the personal items\Nare a concern as well. All paid for through Gucci's\Naccounts and charged as expenses. The multimillion-dollar\Nantiques in the stores. The purchase\Nof countless cars including a Ferrari F40\Nand a Lamborghini Countach. $3 million on a watch,\Na Patek Philippe 2523. $7 million on\Na luxury penthouse. I could go on and on. An 18th century palatial villa\Noutside Florence for use as a training center. I have justifications\Nfor all of these things but it doesn't seem that\Nyou're in a place to hear them. Maurizio, please try and take this\Nin the spirit of our friendship. We've been through\Na lot together. You have many qualities. But we must be realistic. You're not a natural manager. You can't run a business purely\Non charm and eccentricities. No. You need time as well. Last night does mark\Na new chapter for Gucci and I am the one\Nthat brought it to you. Maurizio, I want you\Nto understand whatever happens between\Nboth of our companies, I have never stopped\Nrespecting you or your vision. But I have vision\Nfor my people too. And I have a business to run. We want to offer you\N$150 million for your 50% stake in Gucci. [chuckles softly]\NYou want to buy me out. [Domenico]\NWe want to save the business. And who would be\Nappointed CEO? [chuckles] She was right about you. $150 million. You'll be a rich man. If you really think\Nit's about money, then you know less about Gucci\Nthan I thought. [speaking other language]\NHurry up and eat, boys. [speaking other language] I've never tasted\Nsuch good meat in my life. - Excuse me.\N- Yes. This meat.\NWhere is it coming from? This is the finest beef\Nin Tuscany. It comes from\Nthe Val di Chiana. The cows\Nare treated like royalty. [sighs] [door slams shut] [intense music playing] [horn blaring incessantly] [alarm beeping] That's him. - Good morning!\N- [Maurizio greeting in Italian] <i>Signor</i> Gucci? - [gunshot]\N- [grunts] - [gunshot]\N- [groaning] What's going on? [man groans] [soft instrumental music\Nplaying] [indistinct chatter] [horns honking] [reporters clamoring] [sighs] Patrizia. [Patrizia crying] I know. Please see <i>Signorina</i> Franchi\Nout of my house. ["Baby Can I Hold You" playing] [male judge] <i>Signora</i> Reggiani. <i>Signora</i> Reggiani. [gavel banging] <i>Signora</i> Reggiani.
