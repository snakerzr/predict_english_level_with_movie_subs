Forget it. It's too risky.\NI'm through doing that shit. You always say that.\NThe same thing every time. "l'm through, never again,\Ntoo dangerous." I know that's what I always say.\NI'm always right too. - You forget about it in a day or two.\N- The days of me forgetting are over. The days of me remembering\Nhave just begun. You know, when you go on like this,\Nwhat you sound like? - I sound like a sensible fuckin' man.\N- You sound like a duck. - Quack, quack, quack.\N- Take heart, 'cause you're never\Ngonna have to hear it again. Since I'm never gonna\Ndo it again, you're never\Ngonna have to hear me quack. - After tonight?\N- Correct. I got all tonight to quack. - Can I get anyone more coffee?\N- Oh, yes! - Thank you.\N- You're welcome. I mean, the way it is now, you're takin' the same risk\Nas when you rob a bank. Takin' more of a risk.\NBanks are easier. Federal banks ain't supposed to stop you\Nin any way during a robbery. They're insured. Why should\Nthey give a fuck? I don't even\Nneed a gun in a Federal bank. Heard about this one bloke, he walks\Ninto a bank with a portable phone. He gives the phone to a teller.\NThe bloke on the other end says, "We got this guy's little girl.\NIf you don't give him all your\Nmoney, we're gonna kill her." - Did it work?\N- Fuckin' right it worked.\NThat's what I'm talkin' about. Knucklehead walks into a bank\Nwith a telephone. Not a pistol,\Nnot a shotgun, a fuckin' phone. - Cleans the place out.\NThey don't lift a fuckin' finger.\N- Did they hurt the little girl? There probably never was\Na little girl. The point of\Nthe story isn't a little girl. The point of the story is they\Nrobbed a bank with a telephone. - You want to rob banks?\N- I'm not saying I wanna rob banks. I'm illustrating if we did, it'd be\Neasier than what we've been doing. -No more liquor stores?\N-What've we been talkin' about?\NYeah, no more liquor stores. Besides, it ain't the giggle\Nit used to be. There's too many\Nforeigners own liquor stores. Vietnamese, Koreans,\Ndon't even speak fuckin' English. You tell 'em empty out\Nthe register, they don't know\Nwhat you're talkin' about. They make it too personal. - We keep on, one of these gook\Nfuckers gonna make us kill him.\N- I'm not gonna kill anybody. I don't want to either.\NBut they'll probably put us\Nin a situation where it's us or them. And if it's not the gooks, it's these old fuckin' Jews who've owned\Nthe store for 15 fucking generations. You got Grandpa lrving sitting\Nbehind the counter with\Na fucking Magnum in his hand. Try walkin' into one of those places\Nwith nothing but a phone. See how far that gets you.\NForget it. - We're out of it.\N- Well, what then, day jobs? - Not in this life.\N- What then? Garçon, coffee! This place. Garçon means boy. This place?\NA coffee shop? What's wrong with that? Nobody ever robs restaurants.\NWhy not? Bars, liquor stores, gas stations; you get your head\Nblown off stickin' up one of them. Restaurants, on the other hand,\Nyou catch with their pants down. They're not expectin' to get robbed.\NNot as expectin' anyway. - I bet you could cut down on the\Nhero factor in a place like this.\N- Correct. Same as banks,\Nthese places are insured. Manager.\NHe don't give a fuck. They're just trying to get you out\Nbefore you start pluggin' the diners. Waitresses. Fuckin' forget it.\NNo way they're takin' a bullet\Nfor the register. Busboys. Some wetback gettin'\Npaid $1.50 an hour... really give a fuck\Nyou're stealin' from the owner? Customers sittin' there\Nwith food in their mouths,\Nthey don't know what's goin' on. One minute, they're havin'\Na Denver omelet, the next, someone\Nis stickin' a gun in their face. See, I got the idea the last\Nliquor store we stuck up, remember? - All the customers kept comin' in.\N- Yeah. You got the idea\Nof takin' their wallets.\NNow, that was a good idea. - Thank you.\N- Made more from the wallets\Nthan we did from the register. - Yes, we did.\N- A lot of people come to restaurants. - A lot of wallets.\N- Pretty smart, huh? Pretty smart. I'm ready. Let's do it.\NRight now, right here. - Come on.\N- All right. Same as\Nlast time, remember? You're crowd control.\NI'll handle the employees. - I love you, Pumpkin.\N- I love you, Honey Bunny. Everybody be cool!\NThis is a robbery! Any of you fucking pricks move, and I'll execute\Nevery motherfuckin' last one of you. and I'll execute\Nevery motherfuckin' last one of you. [ "Miserlou" ] [ Radio Dial Tuning ] [ "Jungle Boogie" ] -  Jungle boogie\N-  Get down with the boogie -  Jungle boogie\N-  Get it on -  Jungle boogie\N-  Get down with the boogie -  Jungle boogie\N-  Get it on -  Jungle boogie\N-  Get up with the boogie -  Jungle boogie\N-  Get up with the get down -  Jungle boogie\N-  Get down and boogie -  Jungle boogie\N-  Shake it around - Okay, so tell me again\Nabout the hash bars.\N- Okay, what you want to know? - Hash is legal there, right?\N- It's legal, but it ain't 100% legal. You just can't walk into a restaurant,\Nroll a joint and start puffin' away. I mean, they want you to smoke in\Nyour home or certain designated places. - Those are hash bars?\N- Yeah. It breaks down like this. It's legal to buy it.\NIt's legal to own it. And if you're the proprietor\Nof a hash bar, it's legal to sell it. It's illegal to carry it,\Nbut-but that doesn't matter,\N'cause get a load of this. If you get stopped by a cop\Nin Amsterdam, it's illegal\Nfor them to search you. - I mean, that's a right the cops\Nin Amsterdam don't have.\N- Oh, man! I'm goin'. That's all there is to it.\NI'm fuckin' goin'. I know, baby.\NYou'd dig it the most. - But you know what the funniest thing\Nabout Europe is?\N- What? It's the little differences.\NI mean, they got the same shit\Nover there that they got here, - but it's just there,\Nit's a little different.\N- Example. You can walk into a movie theater\Nin Amsterdam and buy a beer. And I don't mean just like no paper cup.\NI'm talkin' about a glass of beer. And in Paris, you can buy\Na beer in McDonald's.\NYou know what they call... a Quarter-Pounder\Nwith Cheese in Paris? They don't call it\Na Quarter-Pounder with Cheese? They got the metric system.\NThey wouldn't know what the fuck\Na Quarter-Pounder is. - What do they call it?\N- They call it a Royale with Cheese. - Royale with Cheese.\N- That's right. What do they call a Big Mac? Big Mac's a Big Mac,\Nbut they call it Le Big Mac. [ Imitating French Accent ]\NLe Big Mac. [ Laughs ] - What do they call a Whopper?\N- I don't know. I didn't\Ngo into Burger King. - You know what they put on French fries\Nin Holland instead of ketchup?\N- What? - Mayonnaise. [ Chuckles ]\N- Goddamn! - I seen 'em do it, man.\NThey fuckin' drown 'em in that shit.\N- Yuck. We should have shotguns\Nfor this kind of deal. - How many up there?\N- Three or four. - That's countin' our guy?\N- Not sure. - So that means that it could be\Nup to five guys up there?\N- It's possible. We should have\Nfuckin' shotguns. - What's her name?\N- Mia. - Mia. How did Marsellus and her meet?\N- I don't know. However people meet people.\NShe used to be a actress. Oh, really?\NShe do anything I'd have seen? - I think her biggest deal\Nwas she starred in a pilot.\N- Pilot? What's a pilot? - Well, you know the shows on TV?\N- I don't watch TV. Yeah, but you are aware that there\Nis an invention called television, - and on this invention\Nthey show shows, right?\N- Yeah. The way they pick TV shows is they make\None show. That show's called a pilot. Then they show that one show\Nto the people who pick shows... and on the strength of that\None show, they decide if\Nthey wanna make more shows. Some get chosen and\Nbecome television programs.\NSome don't, become nothin'. She starred in one of the ones\Nthat became nothing. You remember\NAntwan Rockamora? Half-black, half-Samoan.\NUsed to call him "Tony Rocky Horror." - Yeah, maybe. Fat, right?\N- I wouldn't go so far as to\Ncall the brother fat. I mean, he got a weight problem.\NWhat's a nigger gonna do? He's Samoan. - I think I know who you mean.\NWhat about him?\N- Marsellus fucked him up good. Word 'round the campfire is\Nit was on account of\NMarsellus Wallace's wife. [ Elevator Bell Rings ] - So what he'd do? Fuck her?\N- No, no, no, no, no. Nothin' that bad. - Well, then what then?\N- He gave her a foot massage. A foot massage? - That's it?\N- Mm-hmm. Then what'd Marsellus do? Sent a couple cats over to his place.\NThey took him out on his patio. Threw his ass over the balcony.\NNigger fell four stories. He had a little garden down\Nat the bottom enclosed in glass,\Nlike a greenhouse. Nigger fell through that. Since then, he kind of\Ndeveloped a speech impediment. - That's a damn shame.\N- Hmm. - But still, you play\Nwith matches, you get burned.\N- What do you mean? You don't be givin' Marsellus Wallace's\Nnew bride a foot massage. You don't think he overreacted? Antwan didn't expect Marsellus\Nto react the way he did,\Nbut he had to expect a reaction. It was a foot massage.\NA foot massage is nothin'.\NI give my mother a foot massage. It's laying your hands in a familiar way\Non Marsellus's new wife. I mean, is it as bad as eatin'\Nher pussy out? No, but it's\Nthe same fuckin' ballpark. Whoa, stop right there.\NEatin' the bitch out... and givin' the bitch a foot massage\Nain't even the same fucking thing. - It's not. It's the same ballpark.\N- Ain't no fuckin' ballpark neither. Now, look, maybe your method\Nof massage differs from mine. But touchin' his wife's feet\Nand sticking your tongue\Nin the holiest of holies... ain't the same fuckin' ballpark;\Nit ain't the same league;\Nit ain't the same fuckin' sport. - Foot massages don't mean shit!\N- Have you ever given a foot massage? [ Scoffs ]\NDon't be tellin' me about foot massages. - I'm the foot fuckin' master.\N- You given a lot of them? Shit, yeah!\NGot my technique down and everything.\NI don't be ticklin' or nothin'. Would you give a guy\Na foot massage? - Fuck you.\N- [ Chuckles ] - You give 'em a lot?\N- Fuck you. - You know, I'm kind of tired.\NI could use a foot massage.\N- Yo, yo, yo, man. You best back off.\NI'm gettin' a little pissed here. - This is the door.\N- Yeah, it is. What time you got? 7:22 in the a.m. No, it ain't quite time yet.\NCome on. Let's hang back. Look, just 'cause I wouldn't give no man\Na foot massage don't make it right... for Marsellus to throw\NAntwan off a building into\Na glass motherfuckin' house, fuckin' up the way the nigger talks;\Nthat shit ain't right. Motherfucker do that shit to me,\Nhe better paralyze my ass,\N'cause I kill the motherfucker. I ain't sayin' it's right,\Nbut you sayin' a massage don't mean\Nnothin'. I'm sayin' it does. Now, look, I've given a million\Nladies a million foot massages,\Nand they all meant somethin'. We act like they don't,\Nbut they do. That's what's\Nso fuckin' cool about them. There's a sensuous thing goin' on... where you don't talk about it,\Nbut you know it and she knows it. Fuckin' Marsellus knew it. And Antwan\Nshould've fuckin' better known better. That's his fuckin' wife, man.\NThis ain't a man with a sense\Nof humor about this shit. You know what I'm sayin'? It's an interestin' point. Come on.\NLet's get into character. - What's her name again?\N- Mia. - Mia.\N- Why you so interested\Nin big man's wife? He's goin' out of town, Florida.\NAnd he asked me if I'd take care\Nof her while he's gone. - Take care of her?\N- No, man. Just take her out. Show her a good time.\NMake sure she don't get lonely. You're gonna be takin'\NMia Wallace out on a date? It is not a date. It's just like if you were\Ngonna take your buddy's wife\Nto a movie or somethin'. - It's just good company, that's all.\N- [ Sighs ] - It's not a date.\NIt's definitely not a date.\N- [ Sighs ] Hey, kids.\NHow you boys doin'? Hey, keep chillin'. You know who we are? We're associates of your\Nbusiness partner, Marsellus Wallace. You do remember\Nyour business partner, don't you? Now, let me take\Na wild guess here. - You're Brett, right?\N- Yeah. I thought so. You remember\Nyour business partner Marsellus Wallace, don't ya, Brett? Yeah, I remember. Good. Looks like me and Vincent\Ncaught you boys at breakfast. Sorry about that.\NWhatcha havin'? Hamburgers. Hamburgers! The cornerstone\Nof any nutritious breakfast. What kind of hamburgers? - Uh, ch-cheeseburgers.\N- No, no, no. Where'd you get 'em?\NMcDonald's, Wendy's, Jack-in-the-Box? - Where?\N- Uh, Big Kahuna Burger. Big Kahuna Burger!\NThat's that Hawaiian burger joint. I hear they got some tasty burgers.\NI ain't never had one myself.\NHow are they? They're-- They're good.

You know what they call\Na Quarter-Pounder with Cheese\Nin France? - No.\N- Tell 'em, Vincent. - A Royale with Cheese.\N- A Royale with Cheese. You know why they call it that? Uh, because of\Nthe metric system? Check out the big brain\Non Brett! You're a smart motherfucker.\NThat's right. The metric system. - What's in this?\N- Sprite. Sprite. Good. You mind if I have some of your\Ntasty beverage to wash this down with? Go right ahead. [ Slurping, Sighs ] That hit the spot. You.

I never-- Oh, I'm sorry,\Ndid I break your concentration? - [ Gasping ]\N- I didn't mean to do that. Please. Continue. You were saying something\Nabout "best intentions." What's the matter?\NOh, you were finished! Oh, well, allow me to retort. What does Marsellus Wallace\Nlook like? What? - What country you from?\N- What? - "What" ain't no country I ever\Nheard of. They speak English in What?\N- W-What? - English, motherfucker!\NDo you speak it?\N- Yes! - Then you know what I'm sayin'!\N- Yes.

I dare ya!\NI double dare you, motherfucker! - Say "what" one more goddamn time!\N- H-H-He's black. - Go on!\N- He's bald! - Does he look like a bitch?\N- What? - [ Gunshot ]\N- [ Screaming ] Does he look... Iike a bitch? - No!\N- Then why you tryin'\Nto fuck him like a bitch? - I didn't.\N- Yes, you did. Yes, you did, Brett! - You tried to fuck him.\N- [ Gasping ] No, no. But Marsellus Wallace don't like to be\Nfucked by anybody except Mrs. Wallace. - You read the Bible, Brett?\N- Yes! Well, there's this passage\NI got memorized. Sort of\Nfits this occasion. Ezekiel 25:17. "The path of the righteous man... is beset on all sides\Nby the inequities of the selfish... and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he who,\Nin the name of charity and goodwill, shepherds the weak\Nthrough the valley of darkness, for he is truly\Nhis brother's keeper... and the finder\Nof lost children. And I will strike down upon thee\Nwith great vengeance... and furious anger... those who attempt to poison\Nand destroy My brothers! And you will know\NMy name is the Lord... when I lay My vengeance\Nupon thee!"

The thing is, Butch, right now...\Nyou got ability. But painful as it may be, ability... don't last. And your days are just about over. Now, that's a hard\Nmotherfuckin' fact of life. But that's a fact of life your ass\Nis gonna have to get realistic about. You see, this business is filled to\Nthe brim with unrealistic motherfuckers. Motherfuckers who thought\Ntheir ass would age like wine. If you mean it turns\Nto vinegar... it does. If you mean it gets better\Nwith age... it don't. Besides, Butch, how many fights you think\Nyou got in you anyway? Hmm? Two? Boxers don't have\Nan old-timers' day. You came close,\Nbut you never made it. And if you were gonna make it,\Nyou would have made it before now. [ Music Continues ] You my nigger? Certainly appears so. [ Chuckles ] The night of the fight,\Nyou may feel a slight sting. That's pride fuckin' with you. Fuck pride! Pride only hurts. It never helps. You fight through that shit. 'Cause a year from now,\Nwhen you kickin' it in the Caribbean, you gonna say to yourself,\N"Marsellus Wallace was right." [ Chuckles ] I got no problem\Nwith that, Mr. Wallace.

It was a show about a team of female\Nsecret agents called Fox Force Five. - What?\N- Fox Force Five. Fox, as in were a bunch\Nof foxy chicks. Force, as in we're a force\Nto be reckoned with. And five, as in there's\None-two-three-four-five of us. There was a blond one,\NSommerset O'Neal. She was the leader. The Japanese fox\Nwas a kung fu master. The black girl\Nwas a demolition expert. French fox's speciality was sex. - What was your speciality?\N- Knives. The character I played,\NRaven McCoy, her background was she grew up\Nraised by circus performers. According to the show,\Nshe was the deadliest woman\Nin the world with a knife. And she knew\Na zillion old jokes. Her grandfather,\Nan old vaudevillian, taught her. And if we would have got picked up,\Nthey would've worked in a gimmick... where every show\NI would've told another joke. You know any of them old jokes? Well, I only got the chance to say one\N'cause we only did one show. - Tell me.\N- It's corny. Don't be that way.\NTell me. - No, you wouldn't like it,\Nand I'd be embarrassed.\N- You'd be embarr-- You told 50 million people,\Nand you can't tell me? - I promise I won't laugh.\N- That's what I'm afraid of, Vince. That's not what I meant.\NYou know it. Now I'm definitely not gonna tell you\N'cause it's been built up too much. What a gyp.\N[ Sighs ] Martin and Lewis. Vanilla Coke. Mmm. Yummy. You think I could\Nhave a sip of that? Be my guest. I gotta know what\Na five-dollar shake tastes like. - You can use my straw.\NI don't have cooties.\N- Yeah, but maybe I do. Cooties I can handle. All right. Goddamn, that's a pretty\Nfuckin' good milkshake! -Told ya.\N-I don't know if it was worth $5,\Nbut it's pretty fuckin' good. [ Music Continues ] - Don't you hate that?\N- Hate what? Uncomfortable silences. Why do we feel it's necessary\Nto yak about bullshit\Nin order to be comfortable? I don't know.\NThat's a good question. That's when you know\Nyou found somebody really special. When you can just shut the fuck up for\Na minute and comfortably share silence. Well, I don't think we're quite\Nthere yet, but don't feel bad.\NWe just met each other. I'll tell you what. I'm gonna go to the bathroom\Nand powder my nose. You sit here...\Nand think of something to say. I'll do that. Okay. [ Wolf Whistle ] [ People Applauding ] [ Sniffing ] I said goddamn! Goddamn!\NGoddamn. [ Woman ]\NI need some hair spray. [ "Since I First Met You" ] Mmmm. Don't you just love it when you\Ncome back from the bathroom to\Nfind your food waiting for you? We're lucky\Nwe got anything at all. I don't think Buddy Holly's\Nmuch of a waiter. Maybe we should've sat\Nin Marilyn Monroe's section. - Which one? There's two Monroes.\N- No, there's not. That is Marilyn Monroe. That is Mamie Van Doren. I don't see Jayne Mansfield,\Nso she must have the night off. - Pretty smart.\N- Yeah. I got my moments. - So did you think of somethin' to say?\N- Actually, I did. However... you seem like\Na really nice person, and l-- - I don't want to offend you.\N- Oooh. This doesn't sound like\Nthe usual, mindless, boring,\Ngettin'-to-know-you chitchat. This sounds like you\Nactually have somethin' to say. Well, well, I do. I do. - [ Inhales ] But you have\Nto promise not to be offended.\N- No, no. You can't promise somethin' like that.\NI have no idea what you're gonna ask me. You can ask me what you're gonna\Nask me, and my natural response\Ncould be to get offended. Then, through no fault of my own,\NI would have broken my promise. - Let's just forget it.\N- That's an impossibility. Trying to forget anything\Nas intriguing as this would be\Nan exercise in futility. - Is that a fact?\N- And besides, - isn't it more, uh, exciting\Nwhen you don't have permission?\N- All right, all right. Well, here goes. What did you think about\Nwhat happened to Antwan? - Who's Antwan?\N- Tony Rocky Horror. You know him. - He fell out of a window.\N- Hmm. Hmm. Well, that is one way to say it.\NAnother way to say it would be\Nthat he was thrown out. Another way would be\Nhe was thrown out by Marsellus. Yet even another way is to say\Nhe was thrown out of a window\Nby Marsellus because of you. - Is that a fact?\N- No. No, it's not a fact. It's just what\NI heard. That's just what I heard. - Who told you?\N- They. "They" talk a lot, don't they? [ Chuckles ] They certainly do.\NThey certainly do. - Don't be shy, Vincent.\NWhat else did "they" say?\N- I'm-- I'm not shy. - Um--\N- Did it involve the "F" word? No, no, no, no, no.\NThey just said that Antwan\Nhad given you a foot massage. - And?\N- And-- And nothin'. That's it. You heard Marsellus... threw Tony Rocky Horror\Nout of a fourth-story window\Nfor giving me a foot massage? - Mm-hmm.\N- And you believe that? [ Chuckles ] Well, at the time\NI was told it sounded reasonable. Marsellus throwing Tony out\Nof a fourth-story window... for massaging my feet\Nseemed reasonable? No, it seemed excessive,\Nbut that doesn't mean it didn't happen. I understand that Marsellus\Nis very protective of you. A husband being protective\Nof his wife is one thing. A husband almost killing\Nanother man for touching\Nhis wife's feet is something else. But did it happen? Only thing Antwan ever touched\Nof mine was my hand when he\Nshook it... at my wedding. Really? Truth is, nobody knows why Marsellus\Nthrew Tony out that window... except Marsellus and Tony. When you little scamps get together,\Nyou're worse than a sewing circle. Ladies and gentlemen. Now the moment\Nyou've all been waiting for. The world-famous\NJackrabbit Slim's twist contest. [ Applause ] Now, this is where\None lucky couple... will win this handsome trophy\Nthat Marilyn here is holding. Now, who will be\Nour first contestants? - Right here!\N- [ Man ] All right! - I wanna dance.\N- No, no, no, no, no. No, no, no, no, no. I do believe\NMarsellus, my husband, your boss, told you to take me out\Nand do whatever I wanted. Now I wanna dance;\NI wanna win; I want that trophy. - So dance good.\N- All right. You asked for it. - So dance good.\N- All right. You asked for it. Let's hear it\Nfor our first contestants. Now let's meet our first\Ncontestants here this evening.\NYoung lady, what is your name? Mrs. Mia Wallace. And how 'bout your fella here? Vincent Vega. All right, let's see what you can do.\NTake it away! - [ Woman ] Go for it.\N- [ Man ] Come on! [ "You Never Can Tell" ] It was a teenage wedding\Nand the old folks wished them well You could see that Pierre\Ndid truly love the mademoiselle And now the young monsieur\Nand madame have rung the chapel bell C'est la vie say the old folks\NIt goes to show you never can tell They furnished off an apartment\Nwith a two-room Roebucks sale The 'coolerador was crammed\Nwith TV dinners and ginger ale But when Pierre found work\Nthe little money comin'\Nworked out well C'est la vie say the old folks\NIt goes to show you never can tell They had a hi-fi phono\Nand boy did they let it blast Seven hundred little records\Nall rock, rhythm and jazz But when the sun went down\Nthe rapid tempo of the music fell C'est la vie say the old folks\NIt goes to show you never can tell They had a teenage wedding\Nand the old folks wished them well You could see that Pierre\Ndid truly love the mademoiselle [ Sighs ] [ Alarm Faintly Beeping ] [ Beeping Stops ] [ Both Laughing ] Is that what you call\Nan uncomfortable silence? I don't know\Nwhat you call that. - [ Chuckles ]\N- Drinks! Music! I'm gonna take a piss. That's a little bit more information\Nthan I needed, but go right ahead. Girl Bomp, bomp, bom You'll be a woman soon I love you so much\NCan't count all the ways I'd die for you, girl\Nand all they can say is [ Singing With Tape ]\NHe's not your kind You never get tired of putting me down\Nand I never know when I come around What I'm gonna find Don't let them\Nmake up your mind Don't you know, girl You'll be a woman soon One drink, and that's it.

Whether or not\Nyou can maintain loyalty. Because... being loyal\Nis very important.

All right, tell me what to do. Okay, you're giving her an injection\Nof adrenalin straight to her heart. - But she's got a breastplate--\NYou gotta pierce through that.\N- [ Thumping ] You gotta bring the needle\Ndown in a stabbing motion. - I gotta-- I gotta\Nstab her three times?\N- No, just stab her once! But it's gotta be hard enough to get\Nthrough her breastplate into her heart. Once you do that,\Nyou p-press down on the p-plunger. - Okay. Then what happens?\N- Kinda curious about that myself. This ain't no fuckin' joke!\NAm I gonna kill her? - She's supposed to come out\Nof it like that. It's--\N- All right, count to three. - All right. Ready?\N- One. [ Vincent Panting ] Two. Three! - [ Loud Thump ]\N- [ Gasps, Screams ] [ Gasping Continues ] [ Coughs, Gasps ] If you're all right,\Nthen say something. Something. [ Chuckles ]\NThat was fuckin' trippy. [ Chuckles ] - Ohh.\N- Oh, man. [ Car Pulls Up ] [ Door Opens, Closes ] - [ Engine Stops ]\N- [ Door Opens, Closes ] Mia. Mia. What's-- What's your thoughts on-- on-- on how to handle this? What's yours? Well, I'm of the opinion\Nthat if Marsellus lived his whole life, he doesn't need to know\Nnothing about this incident. If Marsellus knew\Nabout this incident, I'd be in as much trouble as you. I seriously doubt that. I can keep a secret if you can. Shake on it? Mum's the word? Cool. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going\Nto go home and have a heart attack. Vincent. Do you wanna hear\Nmy Fox Force Five joke? Sure. Except I think I'm still\Na little too petrified to laugh. No, you won't laugh\N'cause it's not funny. But if you still wanna hear it,\NI'll tell it. - I can't wait.\N- Okay. Three tomatoes\Nare walkin' down the street. Papa Tomato, Mama Tomato\Nand Baby Tomato. Baby Tomato starts lagging behind,\Nand Papa Tomato gets really angry. Goes back and squishes him\Nand says, "Ketchup." [ Weak Chuckle ] Ketchup.

Stand up. Now, do you remember when I told you\Nyour daddy died in a P.O.W. camp? Well, this here is Captain Koons. He was in the P.O.W. camp\Nwith Daddy. Hello, little man. Boy, I sure heard\Na bunch about you. See, I was a good friend\Nof your dad's. We were in that Hanoi\Npit of hell together... over five years. Hopefully... you'll never have to\Nexperience this yourself, but when two men are in a situation\Nlike me and your dad were... for as long as we were, you take on certain responsibilities\Nof the other. If it'd been me who'd-- not made it, Major Coolidge'd be talking right now\Nto my son Jim. But the way it turned out,\NI'm talking to you. Butch... I got something for ya. This watch I got here... was first purchased\Nby your great-grandfather\Nduring the first World War. It was bought in a little general store\Nin Knoxville, Tennessee. Made by the first company\Nto ever make wristwatches. Up 'til then, people just\Ncarried pocket watches. It was bought\Nby Private Doughboy Erine Coolidge... on the day he set sail for Paris. This was your\Ngreat-grandfather's war watch, and he wore it every day\Nhe was in that war, and... when he'd done his duty,\Nhe went home to your great-grandmother, took the watch off,\Nput it in an old coffee can,\Nand in that can it stayed... until your granddad, Dane Coolidge,\Nwas called upon by his country... to go overseas and fight\Nthe Germans once again. This time they called it\NWorld War ll. Your great-grandfather gave this watch\Nto your granddad for good luck. Unfortunately, Dane's luck\Nwasn't as good as his old man's. Dane was a Marine,\Nand he was killed... along with all the other Marines\Nat the battle of Wake lsland. Your granddad was facing death. He knew it. None of those boys ever\Nhad any illusions about\Nleaving that island alive, so three days before the Japanese\Ntook the island, your granddad asked\Na gunner on an Air Force transport,\Nname of Winocki-- a man he'd never met before\Nin his life-- to deliver to his infant son, who he'd never seen in the flesh,\Nhis gold watch. Three days later, your granddad\Nwas dead, but Winocki kept his word. After the war was over,\Nhe paid a visit to your grandmother, delivering to your infant father\Nhis dad's gold watch. This watch. This watch was on your daddy's wrist\Nwhen he was shot down over Hanoi. He was captured,\Nput in a Vietnamese prison camp. He knew if the gooks\Never saw the watch, it'd be confiscated,\Ntaken away. The way your dad looked at it,\Nthis watch was your birthright. He'd be damned if any slope's\Ngonna put their greasy, yellow\Nhands on his boy's birthright, so he hid it in one place he knew\Nhe could hide something-- his ass. Five long years\Nhe wore this watch up his ass. Then he died of dysentery--\NHe give me the watch. I hid this uncomfortable\Nhunk of metal up my ass two years. Then... after seven years,\NI was sent home to my family and... now... Iittle man,\NI give the watch to you. - [ Bell Rings ]\N- [ Gasps ] [ Crowd Cheering ] [ Grunting ] [ Cheering Continues ] It's time, Butch. [ Exhaling ] [ Ring Announcer ]\Nln the heavyweight division, - in the right corner\Nwearing the blue trunks,\N- [ Grunts ] weighing 210 pounds, Floyd Ray Wilson! - [ Crowd Cheering, Yelling ]\N- [ Bell Rings ] [ Announcer ]\NIt's official. It's official. - Wilson is dead!\N- [ Announcer #2 ] Well, Dan,\Nthat had to be the bloodiest, hands down, the most brutal fight\Nthis city's ever seen. Coolidge was out of there\Nfaster than I've ever seen\Na victorious boxer leave the ring. - Do you think he knew Wilson was dead?\N- My guess would be yes. I could see the frenzy in his\Neyes give way to the realization\Nof what he was doing. - I think any man would've\Nleft the ring that fast.\N- Do you feel this tragedy... is gonna affect\Nthe world of boxing? A tragedy like this can't help\Nbut shake the world of boxing\Nto its very foundations. It's of paramount importance,\Nduring the sad weeks ahead,\Nthe eyes of the W.B.A. remain-- [ Crowd Cheering,\NYelling Continues ] - [ Engine Starts ]\N- [ Tires Screeching ] [ Horn Honking ] [ Man ]\NMan, you know I didn't-- - Marsellus.\N- No, it wasn't. I didn't do it. I didn't do it. - How you doing?\N- Great. I never thanked you\Nfor dinner. - What you got?\N- He booked. - His trainer?\N- Says he don't know nothin'.\NI believe him. - I think Butch surprised\Nhis ass same as us.\N- No, we don't wanna "think." We wanna know. Take him to\Nthe kennel, sic the dogs on his ass. We'll find out for goddamn sure\Nwhat he knows and what he don't. Butch's search--\NHow do you want it done? I'm prepared to scour the Earth\Nfor that motherfucker. If Butch goes to lndochina, I want\Na nigger hiding in a bowl of rice... ready to pop a cap in his ass. I will take care of it. Mister. - Hey, mister.\N- What? You were in that fight,\Nthe fight on the radio. - You're the fighter?\N- Whatever gave you that idea? No, come on. You're him. I know you're him. Tell me you're him. I'm him. You killed the other boxing man. He's dead? The radio said he was dead. Sorry about that, Floyd. What does it feel like? What does what feel like? Killing a man. Beating another man to death\Nwith your bare hands. What are you, a weirdo? No. It is a subject\NI have much interest in. You are the first person\NI have ever met who has killed somebody. So? - What does it feel like to kill a man?\N- [ Sniffs ] I'll tell you what. Give me one of them cigarettes\Nyou got up there, and I'll\Ntell you all about it. So, Esmarelda... Villa Lobos--\NIs that Mexican? The name is Spanish,\Nbut I am Colombian. - That's some handle\Nyou got there, honey.\N- Thank you. And what is your name? Butch. Butch. - What does it mean?\N- I'm an American, honey.\NOur names don't mean shit. So, moving right along, Esmarelda, what is it you want to know? - I want to know what it\Nfeels like to kill a man.\N- I couldn't tell ya. Didn't know he was dead\N'til you told me he was dead. Now that I know he's dead,\Nyou wanna know how I feel about it? I don't feel\Nthe least bit bad about it. What the fuck'd I tell ya?\NHuh? As soon as the word got out\Nthe fix was in, man, the odds\Nwent through the roof. I know. I know.\NUnbelievable. Hey, fuck him, Scotty. If he was\Na better boxer, he'd still be alive. If he never\Nlaced up his gloves, which he never shoulda done in the first\Nfuckin' place, he'd still be alive. [ Hawks, Spits ] Yeah, well, who gives a fuck?\NIt's over now. Yeah, well, enough about the poor,\Nunfortunate Mr. Floyd. Let's talk about the rich\Nand prosperous Mr. Butch. How many bookies did you\Nlay it around on? All eight?\NHow long to collect? So you'll have it all\Nby tomorrow night? No, I understand. A few stragglers aside.\NOh, fuck, Scotty, that is good news. That is great news, man. Yeah. Mm-hmm. No, me and Fabienne\Nare gonna leave in the morning. It'll probably take us\Na couple days to get down to Knoxville. Okay, my brother. [ Laughing ]\NYou're right. You're goddamn right. All right, Scotty, next time I see you,\Nit'll be on Tennessee time. Cool, brother. $45.60. And, uh, here's a little something\Nfor the effort. Now, if anybody asks you who your fare\Nwas tonight, what are you gonna say? The truth. Three well-dressed,\Nslightly toasted Mexicans. Bonsoir,\NEsmarelda Villa Lobos. Buenas Noches, Butch. Whew. Keep the light off. - Is that better, Sugar Pop?\N- Oui. - [ Siren Wailing ln Distance ]\N- [ Dog Barking ] Hard day at the office? Pretty hard. Got in a fight. Poor baby. Can you make spoons? You know what?\NI was thinkin' about takin' a shower. - I'm stinkin' like a dog over here.\N- I like the way you stink. Let me take this jacket off. - I was looking at myself in the mirror.\N- Uh-huh. I wish I had a pot. You were looking\Nat yourself in the mirror,\Nand you wish you had some pot? A pot. [ Giggles ]\NA pot belly. Pot bellies are sexy. Well, you should be happy,\N[ Grunts ] 'cause you have one. Shut up, fatso.\NI don't have a pot. I have a bit of a tummy,\Nlike Madonna when she did "Lucky Star." It's not the same thing. I didn't know there was\Nsuch a difference between\Na pot belly and a tummy. The difference is huge. [ Kissing ]\NWould you like it if I had a pot belly? No. Pot bellies make a man\Nlook either oafish or like a gorilla. But on a woman\Na pot belly's very sexy. The rest of you is normal-- normal face,\Nnormal legs, normal hips, normal ass-- but with a big,\Nperfectly round pot belly. If I had one, I'd wear a T-shirt\Ntwo sizes too small... to accentuate it. You think men\Nwould find that attractive? I don't give a damn\Nwhat men find attractive. It's unfortunate what we find pleasing\Nto the touch and pleasing to the eye... is seldom the same. [ Sighs ] If you had a pot belly,\NI would punch you in it. - You'd punch me in the belly?\N- Right in the belly. Ohh! I'd smother you! - I'd drop it right on your face\N'til you couldn't breathe!\N- [ Laughing ] - You'd do that?\N- Yeah. - Promise?\N- Yeah. [ Moaning Softly ] - Mmm.\N- Mmm. [ Moaning, Laughing ] Oh.\N[ Inhaling ] [ Grunting ] Did you get everything? - Yes, I did.\N- Good job, Sugar Pop. Did everything\Ngo as planned? - You didn't listen to the-- Ow!\N- [ Giggles ] You didn't listen to the radio? I never listen to your fights.\NWere you the winner? I won, all right. - Are you still retiring?\N- Sure am. So it all worked out\Nin the finish. We're not at the finish yet, baby. [ Moaning ] We're in a lot of danger,\Naren't we? If they find us,\Nthey'll kill us, won't they? But they won't find us,\Nwill they? Do you still want me\Nto go with you? I don't want to be a burden\Nor a nuisance. It's-- [ Moans ] Say it. - [ Moans ]\N- Fabienne, I want you to be with me. - Forever?\N- Forever and ever. Do you love me? Very, very much. [ Moaning ] - Butch.\N- Yes?

Will you hand me a dry towel,\NMiss Beautiful Tulip? - Oh, I like that.\NI like being called a tulip.\N- [ Coughs ] "Tulip" is much better\Nthan "mongoloid." I didn't call you a mongoloid.\NI called you a retard. And I took it back. - [ Grunts ]\N- Butch? Yes, Lemon Pie? - Where are we going to go?\N- Well, I'm not sure yet. Wherever you want. We're gonna get a lot\Nof money from this, but it ain't gonna be\Nthe kind of money... that we can live like hogs\Nin the fathouse forever. I was thinking maybe we could go\Ndown someplace in the South Pacific. Kind of money we're gonna have's gonna\Ncarry us a long way down there. - If we wanted,\Nwe could live in Bora Bora?\N- You betcha. And if after a while you didn't\Ndig that, we could go someplace else. Maybe Tahiti, Mexico. But I do not speak Spanish. Well, you do not speak\NBora-Boran either. Besides, Mexican's easy. - ¿Donde esta el zapateria?\N- What does that mean? Where is the shoe store? - ¿Donde esta--\N- Spit, please.

It's a little early in the morning\Nfor explosions and war. - What was it about?\N- How should I know?\NYou were the one watching it. - No, imbecile,\Nwhat was your dream about?\N- I don't know.

Wow, that looks nice.\N[ Giggles ] To drink-- A tall glass\Nof orange juice... and a black cup of coffee. - After that, I'm going to\Nhave a slice of pie.\N- Pie for breakfast? - [ Laughing ]\N- Any time of the day\Nis a good time for pie. Blueberry pie\Nto go with the pancakes. And on top, a thin slice\Nof melted cheese. Where's my watch? It's there. - No, it's not.\N- Have you looked? Yes, I've fuckin' looked.\NWhat the fuck do you think I'm doin'? You sure you got it? Yes.\NBedside table drawer. - On the little kangaroo?\N- Yes, it was on the little kangaroo. Yeah, well,\Nit's not here now. - [ Rummaging ]\N- Well, it should be. Yes, it most definitely should be,\Nbut it's not here now!\NSo where the fuck is it? Fabienne,\Nwhere's my father's fucking watch? Do you have any idea what he had\Nto go through to get me that watch? I don't have time to go into it,\Nbut he went through a lot. All this other shit you could've set\Non fire, but I specifically reminded\Nyou not to forget the fucking watch. Now think. - Did you get it?\N- I believe so. "You believe so"?\NWhat the fuck does that mean?\NYou either did or didn't get it. Then I did. Are you sure? No. Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Motherfucker!\NMotherfuckin'-- - [ Screaming ]\N- [ Crash ] Do you know how fucking stupid\Nyou fucking are? No!\N[ Grunts ] It's not your fault. You left it at the apartment. If you left it at the apartment,\Nit's not your fault. I had you bring\Na bunch of stuff. [ Exhaling ] I reminded you about it, but I didn't illustrate\Nhow personal the watch was to me. If all I gave a fuck about was\Nthe watch, I shoulda told you that. You're not a mind reader. Are you? [ Sniffling ] I-- I'm sorry. Don't be. Just means\NI can't have breakfast with you. Why does it mean that? Because I gotta go back to my apartment\Nand get my watch. Won't the gangsters\Nbe looking for you there? Well, that's what\NI'm gonna find out. If they are, and I don't think\NI can handle it, then I'll split. I saw your watch. I thought\NI brought it. I'm so sorry. Here's some money.\NGo out and get those pancakes. Have a nice breakfast. I'll take your Honda. I'll be back\Nbefore you can say "blueberry pie." Blueberry pie. Maybe not that fast. - But pretty fast. Okay?\N- Okay. - Bye.\N- Bye. Shit! Of all the fuckin' things\Nshe could fuckin' forget, she forgets my father's watch! I specifically reminded her-- bedside table, on the kangaroo. I said the words:\N"Don't forget my father's watch."

No, no, no, no.\NThat shit wasn't luck. - Yeah, maybe.\N- This was divine intervention. You know what\Ndivine intervention is? I think so. That means that God came down\Nfrom Heaven and stopped the bullets. That's right.\NThat's exactly what it means. God came down from Heaven\Nand stopped these motherfuckin' bullets. I think it's time for us\Nto leave, Jules. Don't do that.\NDon't fuckin' blow this shit off! - What just happened here\Nwas a fuckin' miracle!\N- Chill. This shit happens. Wrong! Wrong.\NThis shit doesn't "just happen." Do you want to continue\Nthis theological discussion in a car... or in a jailhouse\Nwith the cops? We should be fuckin' dead,\Nmy friend! What happened here was a miracle, and I\Nwant you to fucking acknowledge it! All right, it was a miracle.\NCan we go now? Let's go, nigger!\NCome on! Shit. [ Vincent ]\NYou ever seen that show Cops? I was watching it one time,\Nand there was this cop on, and he was talkin' about this\Ngunfight he had in the hallway\Nwith this guy, right? He just unloaded on this guy and nothin'\Nhappened. He didn't hit nothin'. Okay? It was just\Nhim and this guy. I mean, you know, it's,\Nit's freaky, but it happens. You wanna play blind man,\Ngo walk with the shepherd,\Nbut me, my eyes are wide fuckin' open. - What the fuck does that mean?\N- It means that's it for me. From here on in, you can\Nconsider my ass retired. - Jesus Christ. Goddamn it.\N- Don't blaspheme. - I said, don't do that!\N- Hey, why are you fuckin'\Nfreakin' out on us? Look, I'm tellin' Marsellus today--\NI'm through. - Why don't you tell him\Nat the same time why?\N- Don't worry, I will. - And I bet you $10,000\Nhe laughs his ass off.\N- I don't give a damn if he does. [ Sighs ]\NMarvin, what do you make of all this? Man, I don't even\Nhave an opinion. You gotta have an opinion.

I didn't mean it.\NIt was an accident. - Man, I seen some crazy-ass\Nshit in my time, but this--\N- Chill out, man! It was an accident. We probably\Nwent over a bump or somethin'. The car ain't hit\Nno motherfuckin' bump. I didn't mean to shoot\Nthe son of a bitch. The gun went off. Look at this fuckin' mess! We're on\Na city street in broad daylight here! - I don't believe it!\N- Well, believe it now, motherfucker! We gotta get this car off\Nthe road. Cops notice shit\Nlike a car drenched in blood. - Just take it to\Na friendly place, that's all!\N- This is the Valley, Vincent. Marsellus ain't got\Nno friendly places in the Valley. - Well, Jules, this ain't\Nmy fuckin' town, man!\N- Shit! - What you doing?\N- I'm calling my partner in Toluca Lake. -Where's Toluca Lake?\N-Over the hill here, by Burbank Studios. If Jimmie's ass ain't home,\NI don't know what the fuck we gonna do, 'cause I ain't got\Nno other partners in 818. Jimmie, how you doin', man?\NIt's Jules. Just listen up, man. Me and my homeboy are in a car, and we\Ngotta get it off the road, pronto. I need to use your garage\Nfor a couple hours. We gotta be real fuckin' delicate\Nwith this Jimmie situation. He's one remark away\Nfrom kickin' our asses out the door. - If he does, what do we do?\N- We ain't leavin'\N'til we make a couple calls, but I don't want it to reach\Nthat pitch-- Jimmie's a friend. You don't come into your friend's house\Nand start tellin' him what's what. Just tell him\Nnot to be abusive. He kinda freaked out back there\Nwhen he saw Marvin. Put yourself in his position--\NIt's 8:00 in the morning,\Nhe just woke up. He wasn't expectin' this shit. We gotta remember here\Nwho's doin' who a favor. If that favor means I gotta\Ntake shit, he can stick that\Nfavor straight up his ass. - Fuck, nigger, what the fuck'd\Nyou just do to his towel, man?\N- I was dryin' my hands! - You're supposed to wash 'em first!\N- You watched me wash 'em. - I watched you get 'em wet.\N- I was washin' 'em.\NThis shit's hard to get off. Maybe if he'd had Lava\NI coulda done a better job. I used the same\Nfuckin' soap you did, and when I finished, the towel\Ndidn't look like no goddamn maxi-pad! What if he was to come in here\Nand see his towel like this? It's shit like this that's gonna bring\Nthis situation to a head, man! Look, I ain't threatenin' you\Nor nothin', all right? You know I respect you and all.\NBut just don't put me\Nin this position, all right? All right.\NFine. Fine. Ask me nice like that,\Nno problem. Just go handle your friend.\NGo ahead. I don't care. Mmm! Goddamn, Jimmie! This some serious\Ngourmet shit. Me and Vincent\Nwould've been satisfied... with some freeze-dried\NTaster's Choice. Right?\N[ Chuckles ] And he springs this\Nserious gourmet shit on us. - What flavor is this?\N- Knock it off, Julie. - What?\N- I don't need you to tell me\Nhow fuckin' good my coffee is. I'm the one who buys it.\NI know how good it is. When Bonnie goes shopping,\Nshe buys shit. I buy the gourmet expensive stuff 'cause\Nwhen I drink it, I wanna taste it. But you know what's on\Nmy mind right now? It ain't\Nthe coffee in my kitchen. It's the dead nigger\Nin my garage. - Jimmie, don't even worry--\N- Don't tell me about anything.\NI wanna ask you a question. When you came pulling in here, did you notice the sign\Non the front of my house that said,\N"Dead Nigger Storage"? - You know I ain't seen no--\N- Did you notice the sign on\Nthe front of my house... that said,\N"Dead Nigger Storage"? No. I didn't. - You know why you didn't\Nsee that sign?\N- [ Sighs ] Why? 'Cause it ain't there,\N'cause storing dead niggers\Nain't my fuckin' business, that's why! - We're not gonna store\Nthe motherfucker--\N- Don't you fuckin' realize... that if Bonnie comes home and\Nfinds a dead body in her house,\NI'm gonna get divorced? No marriage counselor.\NNo trial separation.\NI'm gonna get fuckin' divorced. Okay? And I don't wanna\Nget fuckin' divorced! Man, you know, fuck, I wanna help you,\Nbut I don't wanna lose my wife doin' it. Jimmie, Jimmie,\Nshe ain't gonna leave you. Don't fuckin' "Jimmie" me, Jules!\NOkay? Don't fuckin' "Jimmie" me. There's nothin' you're gonna\Nsay that's gonna make me forget\NI love my wife. Is there? Now, look, you know, she comes home\Nfrom work in about an hour and a half. The graveyard shift\Nat the hospital. You gotta make some phone calls?\NYou gotta call some people? Well, then, do it, and then get the fuck\Nout of my house before she gets here. That's Kool and the Gang.\NWe don't wanna fuck your shit up. All I wanna do is call my people\Nand get 'em to bring us in. You're fucking my shit up\Nright now! You're gonna fuck my shit up\Nbig time if Bonnie comes home. Do me that favor, all right?\NThe phone is in my bedroom.\NI suggest you get going. Well, say she comes home. What do you think she'll do? Oh, no fuckin' shit she'll freak. That ain't no kinda answer. I mean, you know, I don't.\NHow much? A lot or a little? You got to appreciate\Nwhat an explosive element... this Bonnie situation is. She comes home from a hard day's work,\Nfinds a bunch of gangsters\Nin her kitchen... doing a bunch of gangster shit, there ain't no tellin'\Nwhat she's liable to do. [ All Gasping ] Yeah, I grasp that, Jules. All I'm doing is\Ncontemplating the ifs. I don't wanna hear about\Nno motherfuckin' ifs! All I want to hear from your ass\Nis, "You ain't got no problem,\NJules. I'm on the motherfucker. Chill them niggers out\Nand wait for the cavalry,\Nwhich should be coming directly." You ain't got no problem, Jules. I'm on the motherfucker. Chill them niggers out and wait for\Nthe Wolf, who should be coming directly. You sendin' the Wolf? Oh, you feel better,\Nmotherfucker? Shit, yeah, negro! That's all you had to say! -  [ Piano ]\N- [ Man ] She the hysterical type? - When is she due?\N- [ Partygoers Chattering ] Mm-hmm. Give me\Nthe principals' names again. [ Man ]\NPlace your bets. - Jules. Mm-hmm.\N- Cards, please. Vincent. Jimmie. Bonnie. Mm-hmm. It's thirty minutes away.\NI'll be there in ten. [ Tires Screeching ] [ Doorbell Rings ] You're... Jimmie, right?\NThis is your house? - It sure is.\N- I'm Winston Wolf. I solve problems. - Good. We got one.\N- So I heard. May I come in? Uh, yeah. Please do. You must be Jules.\NWhich would make you... Vincent. Let's get down\Nto brass tacks, gentlemen. If I was informed correctly, the clock\Nis ticking. Is that right, Jimmie? Uh, one hundred percent. - Your wife Bonnie comes home\Nat 9:30 in the a.m., correct?\N- Uh-huh. I was led to believe if she\Ncomes home and finds us here,\Nshe wouldn't appreciate it much. - She wouldn't at that.\N- That gives us 40 minutes\Nto get the fuck outta Dodge, which, if you do what I say,\Nwhen I say it, should be plenty. Now, you got a corpse\Nin a car, minus a head,\Nin a garage. Take me to it. [ Sighs ] - Jimmie.\N- Uh-huh. Do me a favor, will ya? Thought I\Nsmelled some coffee back there. - Would you make me a cup?\N- Uh, yeah, sure. Oh, uh, um,\Nhow do you take it? Lotsa cream, lotsa sugar. About the car, is there anything\NI need to know? Does it stall? Does it smoke? Does it make\Na lot of noise? ls there gas in it? - Aside from how it looks,\Nthe car's cool.\N- Positive? Don't get me on the road and I find out\Nthe brake lights don't work. - As far as I know,\Nthe motherfucker's tip-top.\N- Good enough. Let's go back\Nto the kitchen. [ Exhales ] - Here you go, Mr. Wolf.\N- Thank you, Jimmie. Mmm. Okay, first thing.\NYou two. Take the body,\Nstick it in the trunk. This looks to be\Na pretty domesticated house. - That would lead me to believe\Nyou got cleansers and shit.\N- Yeah. Under the sink. Good. What I need you two fellas to do\Nis take those cleaning products... and clean the inside of the car--\NI'm talkin' fast, fast, fast. Go in the back seat, scoop up all\Nthose little pieces of brain and skull. Get it out of there.\NWipe down the upholstery. It don't need to be spick-and-span.\NYou don't need to eat off it. Just give it a good once-over.\NWhat you need to take care of\Nare the really messy parts. The pools of blood that have collected,\Nyou gotta soak that shit up. We need to raid\Nyour linen closet. I need blankets,\NI need comforters, quilts, bedspreads. The thicker the better,\Nthe darker the better.\NNo whites. Can't use 'em. We'll need to camouflage the front seat\Nand back seat and floorboards... with quilts and blankets, so if a cop starts stickin'\Nhis big snout in the car,\Nthe subterfuge won't last, but at a glance the car\Nwill appear to be normal. Jimmie, lead the way.\NBoys, get to work. "Please" would be nice. - Come again?\N- I said, a "please" would be nice. Get it straight, buster.\NI'm not here to say please.\NI'm here to tell you what to do. And if self-preservation\Nis an instinct you possess, you'd better fuckin' do it\Nand do it quick. I'm here to help. If my help's\Nnot appreciated, lotsa luck, gentlemen. No, Mr. Wolf, it ain't like that;\Nyour help is definitely appreciated. Mr. Wolf, listen. I don't\Nmean disrespect, okay? I respect you. I just don't like people\Nbarkin' orders at me. If I'm curt with you,\Nit's because time is a factor. I think fast, I talk fast,\Nand I need you guys to act fast\Nif you wanna get out of this. So pretty please, with sugar on top,\Nclean the fuckin' car. Don't be lookin' at me like that,\Nall right? I can feel your look. It's a 1974 Chevy Nova. [ Sipping ] Green. Nothin' except for\Nthe mess inside. Mmm, about 20 minutes. Nobody who'll be missed. You're a good man, Joe.\NThanks a bunch. - How we comin', Jimmie?\N- Pretty good. - I got it all here, but, uh,\N- [ Sighs ] - Mr. Wolf,\Nyou gotta understand something.\N- Winston, Jimmie, Winston. Okay. You gotta\Nunderstand something, uh, Winston. Uh-- Uh, no,\Nthank you. Uh, this is\Nour best linen here, and it's, uh--\Nit was a wedding present... from my Uncle Conrad\Nand my Aunt Ginny. - They're not with us anymore.\NI wanna help--\N- Let me ask you a question. - If you don't mind.\N- No, no, please. Go ahead. Your Uncle Conrad and Aunt Ginny,\Nwere they millionaires? No. Well, your Uncle Marsellus is. And I'm positive that if\NUncle Conrad and Aunt... - Ginny.\N- Ginny were here, they would furnish you\Nwith a whole bedroom set, which your Uncle Marsellus\Nis more than happy to do. I like oak myself.\NThat's what I have in my bedroom. How about you, Jimmie? You an oak man? Oak's nice. Oh, man, I will never\Nforgive your ass for this shit. This is some fucked-up,\Nrepugnant shit. Jules, did you ever hear the philosophy\Nthat once a man admits he is wrong... that he is immediately forgiven\Nfor all wrongdoings? Get the fuck out my face\Nwith that shit! The motherfucker that said\Nthat shit never had to pick up\Nitty-bitty pieces of skull... - on account of your dumb ass.\N- I got a threshold, Jules,\Nfor the abuse that I will take. Right now, I'm a fuckin' race car,\Nand you got me in the red. I'm just sayin' it's fuckin' dangerous\Nto have a race car in the fuckin' red. That's all.\NI could blow. - Oh, you ready to blow?\N- Yeah. Well, I'm a mushroom-cloud-layin'\Nmotherfucker, motherfucker. Every time my fingers touch brain,\NI'm Superfly T.N.T. I'm the Guns of the Navarone. In fact, what the fuck\Nam I doin' in the back? You're the motherfucker should be on\Nbrain detail! We're fuckin' switchin'. I'm washin' windows, and you're\Npickin' up this nigger's skull! Fine job, gentlemen. You may get out of this yet. I can't believe\Nthis is the same car. Well, let's not start suckin'\Neach other's dicks quite yet. Phase one is complete-- Clean the car--\Nwhich moves us right along to Phase two: Clean you two. Strip. - All the way?\N- [ Wolf ] To your bare ass. Quickly, gentlemen.\NWe got about 15 minutes... before Jimmie's better half\Ncomes pulling into the driveway. Goddamn, this morning air\Nis some chilly shit. Are you sure this is\Nabsolutely necessary? - You know what you two look like?\N- [ Vincent ] What? Like a couple of guys\Nwho just blew off somebody's head. Strippin' off those bloody rags\Nis absolutely necessary. Toss 'em in Jimmie's garbage bag. Don't do nothin' stupid,\Nlike leavin' this shit out front\Nfor the garbageman to pick up. Don't worry, we're taking it with us.\NJim, the soap. - Vincent.\N- [ Wolf ] Okay, gentlemen. You both been to County before,\NI'm sure. Here it comes. - Goddamn! The water's fuckin' cold!\N- Yo! Yo! Yo! Better you than me, gentlemen.\N[ Chuckling ] - Don't be afraid of the soap.\NSpread it around.\N- [ Yelling Continues ] - Get 'em there a little bit.\NVincent's hair.\N- Hey, get out of my hair! - Come on. Do it, goddamn it! Do it!\N- Uh, um-- Towel. [ Wolf ] You're dry enough.\NToss 'em their clothes. [ Wolf Laughing ]\NPerfect. Perfect. We couldn't have\Nplanned this better. You guys look like-- What do they look like,\NJimmie? - Dorks. They look like\Na couple of dorks.\N- [ Laughing ] - [ Both Laughing ]\N- Ha-ha-ha. They're your\Nclothes, motherfucker. Come on, gentlemen.\NWe're laughing our way\Nright into prison. Don't make me beg. Okay, gentlemen, let's get\Nour rules of the road straight. We're going to a place\Ncalled Monster Joe's Truck and Tow. Monster Joe and his daughter Raquel\Nare sympathetic to our dilemma. The place is North Hollywood, so a few twists and turns aside,\Nwe'll be goin' up Hollywood Way. Now, I'll drive the tainted car.\NJules, you ride with me. Vincent, you follow\Nin my Acura. Now, if we come across the path\Nof any John Q. Laws, - nobody does a fuckin' thing\N'til I do something.\N- Right. - What did I say?\N- Don't do shit unless. - Unless what?\N- Unless you do it first. Spoken like a true prodigy. How about you, Lash LaRue?\NCan you keep your spurs\Nfrom jingling and jangling? The gun went off. I don't know why.\NI'm cool. I promise you. Fair enough. Now, I drive real\Nfuckin' fast, so keep up. If get my car back\Nany different than I gave it, Monster Joe's gonna be\Ndisposing of two bodies. - [ Metal Door Slamming ]\N- [ Engine ldling ] Outta my way, Rex. - We cool?\N- Like it never happened. - [ Vincent ] All right.\N- Boys, this is Raquel. Someday all this will be hers. Hi. So, what's\Nwith the outfits? - You guys going to\Na volleyball game or something?\N- [ Wolf Laughs ] I'm takin' milady\Nout for breakfast. Maybe I could drop you two off.\NWhere do you live? - Redondo.\N- Inglewood. It's--\NIt's your future. I-- I see a--\Na cab ride. Move outta the sticks, fellas.\NSay good night, Raquel. - Good night, Raquel.\N- I'll see you guys around. Stay outta trouble,\Nyou crazy kids. Mr. Wolf, I just wanna tell you it was\Na real pleasure watching you work. Yeah, really.\NAnd thank you very much, Mr. Wolf. Call me Winston. - You see that, young lady? Respect.\N- [ Alarm Deactivates ] - Respect for one's elders\Nshows character.\N- I have character. - Because you are a character\Ndoesn't mean that you have character.\N- [ Chuckles ] - [ Tires Screeching ]\N- Wanna share a cab? - I'd go for some breakfast.\NFeel like havin' breakfast with me?\N- [ Phone Dialing ] Cool. I don't know why, I just thought\Nhe'd be European or something. - Yeah, he's about as European\Nas fuckin' English Bob.\N- I know that now. - But was he cool or what?\N- Thank you. Totally fuckin' cool,\Nin control. Didn't even really get pissed when you\Nwere fuckin' with him; I was amazed. - [ Chuckles ]\N- Want some bacon? No, man, I don't eat pork. - Are you Jewish?\N- I ain't Jewish; I just don't\Ndig on swine, that's all. - Why not?\N- Pigs are filthy animals. I don't eat filthy animals. Yeah, but bacon tastes good.\NPork chops taste good. Sewer rat may taste like pumpkin pie,\Nbut I'd never know... 'cause I wouldn't eat\Nthe filthy motherfuckers. Pigs sleep and root in shit.\NThat's a filthy animal. I ain't eatin' nothin' ain't got\Nsense enough to disregard its own feces. - What about a dog?\NDog eats its own feces.\N- I don't eat dog either. Yeah, but do you consider\Na dog to be a filthy animal? I wouldn't go so far\Nas to call a dog filthy, but they're definitely dirty. - But a dog's got personality.\NPersonality goes a long way.\N- Ah, so, by that rationale, if a pig had a better personality,\Nhe would cease to be a filthy animal. - Is that true?\N- We'd have to be talkin' about\None charming motherfuckin' pig. I mean, he'd have to be\Nten times more charming than\Nthat Arnold on Green Acres. [ Both Laughing ] Oh, man, that's good. That's good, man.\NYou're startin' to lighten up. You've been sittin' there,\Nall serious and shit. - I just been sittin' here, thinkin'.\N- About what? - About the miracle we witnessed.\N- Miracle you witnessed. - I witnessed a freak occurrence.\N- What is a miracle, Vincent? - Act of God.\N- And what's an act of God? When, um, God makes\Nthe impossible possible. But this morning... - I don't think qualifies.\N- Hey, Vincent. See, that shit don't matter.\NYou're judging this shit the wrong way. It could be God stopped the bullets,\Nchanged Coke to Pepsi,\Nfound my car keys. You don't judge shit like this\Nbased on merit. Now, whether or not\Nwhat we experienced... was an according-to-Hoyle miracle\Nis insignificant. But what is significant is,\NI felt the touch of God. God got involved. But why? Well, that's what's fuckin' with me:\NI don't know why. - But I can't go back to sleep.\N- You're serious. You're really thinkin'\Nabout quittin'. - For life? Most definitely.\N- Yeah. Fuck.\NWhat you gonna do then? Well, that's what I been\Nsitting here contemplating. First I'm gonna deliver\Nthis case to Marsellus. Then, basically, I'm just\Ngonna walk the Earth. - What you mean, "walk the Earth"?\N- Like Caine in Kung Fu. Walk from place to place,\Nmeet people, get in adventures. And how long do you intend\Nto walk the Earth? - 'Til God puts me\Nwhere He wants me to be.\N- What if He don't do that? - If it takes forever,\Nthen I'll walk forever.\N- So you decided to be a bum. I'll just be Jules, Vincent.\NNo more, no less. No, Jules,\Nyou decided to be a bum, just like all those pieces of shit\Nout there who beg for change, who sleep in garbage bins,\Neat what I throw away. They got a name for that, Jules.\NIt's called a bum. And without a job,\Na residence or legal tender,\Nthat's what you're gonna be, man. You're gonna be\Na fuckin' bum. Look, my friend,\Nthis is just where you and I differ. Garçon! Coffee! Jules, look, what happened this morning,\Nman, I agree it was peculiar. - But water into wine, l--\N- All shapes and sizes, Vincent. - Don't fuckin' talk\Nto me that way, man.\N- If my answers frighten you, then you should cease\Nasking scary questions. I'm gonna take a shit. Let me ask you something. When did you make this decision?\NWhen you were sittin' there\Neatin' that muffin? Yeah. I was sittin' here\Neatin' my muffin, drinkin' my coffee, replayin' the incident\Nin my head, when I had what alcoholics refer to\Nas a moment of clarity. Fuck. To be continued. - I love you, Pumpkin.\N- I love you, Honey Bunny. - Everybody be cool!\NThis is a robbery!\N- [ Customers Murmuring ] Any one of you fucking pricks move,\Nand I'll execute every one\Nof you motherfuckers! - You got that?\NYou just be quiet over there!\N- Waitresses on the floor! Get on the fuckin'--\NGet the fuck down! You're in a blind spot.\NTake your dames over to that booth,\Non the count of ten! - Mexicans, out of\Nthe fucking kitchen!\N- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8-- What the fuck are you doing,\Nyou fucking yuppie? Get down! - Get down!\N- Throw those bags! - Fucking move! Move!\N-  [ Ranchero ] - [ Cooks Speaking Spanish ]\N- Move! Get the fuck-- Get down on the fucking floor! Grandpa! Down! I'm the manager here, and there's\Nno problem. No problem at all. - You gonna give me a problem?\N- No, sir, I'm not. Thought you said you were gonna\Ngive me a fucking problem! - I think we got\Na hero here, Honey Bunny.\N- Well, just execute him! - [ Panting ]\N- I am not a hero. - I'm just a coffee shop manager.\N- Get the fuck down! The restaurant's ours! - Just take whatever you want.\N- [ Panting ] - You talk to the customers.\N- Yeah. You tell them to be fucking cool\Nand everything will be over. - You understand me?\N- Yes! Listen, everybody. Be calm, cooperate, and this'll all be over\Nin a minute! Get the fuck down!\NWell done. [ Country/Western Muzak ] All right, now, people, gonna\Ncome around and collect your wallets! You don't fucking talk. You just\Nthrow 'em in the bag! Are we clear? I said, are we fucking clear? Good!\NNow, wallets out! [ Pumpkin ] That's it.\NGet the fuck down. In the bag. - In the fucking bag!\N- [ Customer ] I don't\Nhave nothin' on me, man. In the bag. What am I waiting for?\Nln the fucking bag. Laura. Laura. Tips.\NIn the bag. - Is that a cellular phone?\N- Yeah. In the fucking bag. Tidy up, tidy up, that's it.\NNow get the fuck down on the floor. In the bag.\NIn the bag. In the bag. - What's in the case?\N- My boss's dirty laundry. - Your boss makes you do his laundry?\N- When he wants it clean. - Sounds like a shit job.\N- Funny, I was thinkin' the same thing. - Open it.\N- 'Fraid I can't do that. - I didn't hear you.\N- Yes, you did. What's going on? - Looks like we got\Na vigilante in our midst.\N- Shoot him in the face! I hate to shatter your ego,\Nbut this ain't the first time\NI've had a gun pointed at me. - If you don't take your hand off\Nthat case, it'll be your last.\N- Stop causing problems! You'll get us all killed! Give 'em\Nwhat you got and get 'em outta here! Shut the fuck up, fat man! This ain't\Nnone of your goddamn business! Be cool, Honey Bunny, be cool. No problem.\NI got it under control. Now, I'm gonna count to three. If you don't open that case,\NI'm gonna unload in your fucking face. We clear? One. Two. - Three.\N- Okay, Ringo. You win. It's yours. - Open it.\N- [ Latches Springing ] [ Honey Bunny ]\NHey, what is it? What is it? Is that what I think it is? Mm-hmm. It's beautiful. [ Giggling ]\NGoddamn it, what is it? You let him go!\NYou let him go! - Let go of him, or I'm gonna kill you!\N- Tell that bitch to be cool. - Say, "Bitch, be cool!"\NSay, "Bitch, be cool!"\N- Be cool! Be cool! - Tell that bitch to chill!\N- You're gonna die so fuckin' bad! - Chill that fuckin' bitch out!\N- Chill out, Honey Bunny! - Let go of him!\N- Chill out, Honey Bunny! - Now, promise her\Nit's gonna be all right!\N- I promise! - Tell her to chill!\N- Chill out, Honey Bunny! - Now tell me her name.\N- Yolanda. All right, now, Yolanda, we're not\Ngonna do anything stupid, are we? - Don't you hurt him!\N- Nobody's gonna hurt anybody! We're all gonna be like three little\NFonzies here. And what's Fonzie like? - Come on, Yolanda!\NWhat's Fonzie like?\N- He's cool. - What?\N- Cool. Correctamundo.\NAnd that's what we're gonna be. We're gonna be cool. Now, Ringo,\NI'm gonna count to three. And when I count three, I want you to\Nlet go of your gun, put your palms flat on the table\Nand sit your ass down. And when you do it, you do it cool. You ready? One, two, three. - [ Panting ] Okay, now you let him go!\N- Yolanda! I thought you were gonna\Nbe cool. Now, when you yell\Nat me, it makes me nervous. When I get nervous,\NI get scared. When motherfuckers get scared,\Nthat's when motherfuckers\Naccidentally get shot. Just know, you hurt him, you die. Well, that seems to be\Nthe situation. But I don't want that. And you don't want that. And Ringo here definitely\Ndoesn't want that. So let's see what we can do. Now... here's the situation. Normally both your asses would be\Ndead as fuckin' fried chicken, but you happened to pull this shit\Nwhile I'm in a transitional period, and I don't wanna kill you;\NI wanna help you. But I can't give you this case,\N'cause it don't belong to me. Besides, I been through too much shit\Nover this case this morning... to just hand it over\Nto your dumb ass. - Vincent!\N- [ Yells ] - Be cool! Yolanda, it's cool, baby.\N- Get back! It's cool!\NWe still just talkin'. - Come on. Point the gun at me.\NPoint the gun at me. There you go.\N- [ Yolanda Whimpering ] Now, Vincent, you just hang back... and don't do\Na goddamn thing. Tell her it's still cool. - It's still cool, Honey Bunny.\N- How we doin', baby? I-- I gotta go pee. I wanna go home. Hang in there, baby. I'm proud of you.\NAnd Ringo's proud of you. It's almost over.\NTell her you're proud of her. - I'm proud of you, Honey Bunny.\N- I love you. - I love you too, Honey Bunny.\N- Now, I want you to go in that bag\Nand find my wallet. - Which one is it?\N- It's the one that says\N"Bad Motherfucker." That's it.\NThat's my bad motherfucker. Open it up.\NTake out the money. [ Jules ]\NCount it. How much is there? About 1,500 dollars. Okay, put it in your pocket.\NIt's yours. Now, with the rest\Nof those wallets and the register, that makes this a pretty successful\Nlittle score, huh? Jules, you give that fuckin'\Nnimrod 1,500 dollars, and I'll\Nshoot him on general principle. No, Yolanda! Yolanda! He ain't gonna\Ndo a goddamn, motherfuckin' thing! Vince, shut the fuck up! - Shut up!\N- Come on, Yolanda. Stay with me, baby. Now, I ain't givin' it\Nto him, Vincent. I'm buyin' something\Nfor my money. - Wanna know what I'm buyin', Ringo?\N- What? Your life. I'm givin' you that money\Nso I don't have to kill your ass. You read the Bible, Ringo? Not regularly, no. Well, there's this passage\NI got memorized. Ezekiel 25:17. "The path of the righteous man\Nis beset on all sides... by the inequities\Nof the selfish... and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he who,\Nin the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak\Nthrough the valley of darkness, for he is truly his brother's keeper\Nand the finder of lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with\Ngreat vengeance and furious anger... those who attempt to poison\Nand destroy My brothers. And you will know\NI am the Lord... when I lay My vengeance\Nupon you." I been sayin' that shit for years, and if you heard it,\Nthat meant your ass. I never gave much thought\Nto what it meant. I just thought it was some coldblooded\Nshit to say to a motherfucker... before I popped a cap\Nin his ass. But I saw some shit this morning\Nmade me think twice. See, now I'm thinkin'\Nmaybe it means... you're the evil man,\Nand I'm the righteous man, and Mr. 9-millimeter here,\Nhe's the shepherd... protecting my righteous ass\Nin the valley of darkness. Or it could mean... you're the righteous man,\Nand I'm the shepherd, and it's the world\Nthat's evil and selfish. Now, I'd like that. But that shit\Nain't the truth. The truth is, you're the weak... and I'm the tyranny\Nof evil men. But I'm tryin', Ringo. I'm tryin' real hard... to be the shepherd. Go. I think we should be\Nleaving now. -  [ "Surf Rider" ]\N- Yeah, that's probably a good idea. [ Music Continues ]
