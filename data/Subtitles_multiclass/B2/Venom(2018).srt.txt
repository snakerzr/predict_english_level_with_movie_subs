Hey, Richard! - Lookin' good!\N- Eddie, you can't park there, bro. Come on, man. There's\Nno such thing as can't. How'd she do? Berkeley. Brown.

You know what I love\Nabout this view? - It never gets old.\N- Yeah, well, uh... Height's not really my thing. But, uh...\NWhat's the deal? - I got you the big one, exclusive.\N- Yeah? Who? Carlton Drake. - Carlton Drake?\N- The man's a visionary. He wants to talk\Nabout his rockets, assure everyone they're safe,\Nthat the crash was an anomaly. Uh... He's... He's seriously off. I'm gonna level with you. Carlton Drake could buy us\Nwith his pocket cash, turn this building into his\Nown garage if he so wished. Now, you're just gonna ask him\Nabout his space program, you're gonna thank him, and\Nyou're gonna bid him a nice day. He's a crook. Eddie, when you had nowhere\Nto go, we gave you a home. Now, you know we love\Nthe Eddie Brock show. There isn't a better investigative\Nreporter working today, but no one\Nis above the network. So do me a favor, Eddie,\Ndon't start your shit again. All right, all right. - For me.\N- All right. I'll do it. I don't know why he gave\Nme this assignment, Annie. It's not...\NIt's not what I do. Well, my mother\Nalways told me that anything in life worth\Nhaving would take sacrifice... - Mmm-hmm.\N- Patience... - Mmm.\N- And be a lot of work. - Oh.\N- That's you... - That's not.\N- ...that I'm talking about. - Nah.\N- Yeah. Well, you're lucky\Nto have me. To be fair,\NI'm quite a catch. That's what my mom told me. Are you gonna\Nbehave yourself tomorrow? No. No, I'm gonna do my job.\NThat's what I'm gonna do. I can't, you know,\Nnot do my job. The guy you work for\Nis a complete... I don't work for Drake.\NI work for my firm, and my firm works for him. And I'm sure\Nthat they defend many people that you don't deem worthy,\Nbut we don't want a repeat. - A repeat?\N- Of the <i>Daily Globe</i> incident. Ow! Really? - Incident? That's not an incident.\N- Mmm-hmm. - Baby, you were run out of New York.\N- I was not. I did not. I don't want you\Nrun out of San Francisco. No, I still have\Ncurrency in New York. I was going places. I wasn't running. I was going places. In fact, I moved\Nto San Francisco for you. - Me?\N- You are my home. You're not so bad yourself,\Nchamp. - Less talking, more kissing.\N- All right. Let's just get the check. I'm gonna get a drink. Shh. Very soon,\Nanother Life Foundation rocket will be sent\Non an exploratory mission. And that's how, one day,\Nwe might all live in space. Cool, huh? And now that I've shown you some of the cool stuff\Nthat we do here, I'm hoping I've inspired\Neach and every one of you to go out there\Nand create things that others - have only dreamt of.\N- Mr. Drake? - Shh!\N- It's okay. Don't silence her. Come here. What's your name? - Allie.\N- It's okay, Allie. You know, sometimes\Nthat's what people do. They try and silence\Nthose of us who ask questions. But you know what?\NIn the end, we're the ones\Nwho change the world. Take good care\Nof that, Allie. Guys, this is Dr. Skirth. - Say hi.\N- Hi. Hello, kids. Um, sorry to interrupt, but it's time to get changed\Nfor your interview. Yeah. Uh, kids,\Nsorry to leave you. Allie, you're in charge.\NHigh five up top. Dr. Skirth will answer Allie's\Nquestion, and any others. - See you next time, guys. Bye!\N- Bye! <i>What do you say,\NMr. Drake,</i> we just start\Nat the beginning? - Born to British parents.\N- Mmm-hmm. And then at 19, you\Ndiscovered a gene therapy that literally doubles\Nthe life expectancy - of pancreatic cancer patients.\N- Well, actually, it tripled their\Nlife expectancy. But it's okay. Okay, um, 24.\NThat's still extremely young. All right, you create - the Life Foundation!\N- It didn't happen overnight. - And then...\N- Rockets. You then decide,\Nlike any normal human being, that you're gonna go\Nand explore space. You know what it is?\NI have always believed... - Uh-huh.\N- ...that space exploration is crucial\Nin our quest to cure everything that ails us\Nhere on Earth. But if you think about\Neverything we've found... - Uh-huh.\N- ...in the oceans and on land, - isn't it time to look up there?\N- Mmm-hmm. To this plethora\Nof untapped resources? And you have a plethora\Nof untapped resources, also, from your pharmaceutical\Ncompanies that you're involved with,\Nyou know, to help you realize - that ambition, I suppose.\N- Of course. - Yeah.\N- Full circle. So, I have to ask,\Nhow does that work, you know, exactly,\Nthe Life Foundation thing? How does it...\NHow does it, um... I don't know,\Nhow does it go about, - say, testing pharmaceuticals?\N- Eddie, we're talking - about the rocket here.\N- No, I'm not. I'm not. I'm talking\Nabout the allegations. - I'm sorry, I don't...\N- It says that your entire empire\Nhas been built - on dead bodies.\N- Eddie. It's true, right?\NIt says that you recruit the most vulnerable of us\Nto volunteer for tests... - Hmm.\N- ...that more often than not end up killing people. Yeah, I'm aware\Nof these rumors online. There's a lot of fake news\Nout there these days. Right. What about\Nthe legal cases? Sorry? Uh, the actual legal cases,\Nlike Sarah Chambers, - Phil Barclay, Rob MacDonald.\N- That's it. Time to go. Thank you so much for coming\Nto talk to me, Mr. Brock. And they're just some\Nof the people who walked - through these doors...\N- Have a nice day. - Cut the camera off, please.\N- Thank you very much. - Time is up. Come on.\N- They're dead. The Dead... - Could you show him out, please?\N- The Dead Found... Don't touch me.\NThe Dead Foundation thing. - Get out of here, Brock.\N- We're not finished. Yes, you are, Mr. Brock. Is that a threat? Have a nice life. I know what\Nyou're going to say, but... This guy, he is\Nall the way bad, Jack. - If you just give...\N- Who's your source? - Excuse me?\N- Who's your source, Eddie? I don't have a source, per se.\NBut I have a hunch. This isn't the Wild Wild West. We don't go off half-cocked\Nbased on a hunch. We do the work. We substantiate\Nour accusations. We provide evidence. You know, for a smart guy,\Nyou really are a dumb-ass. You're fired, Eddie. I can't trust you. Have a nice life. - Will just take a second.\N- Okay. Hey. You are pathologically\Nself-absorbed. Annie. Annie,\Ncan you talk to me first? Your ego requires\Nconstant attention, and you're stubborn as hell. But I was willing to roll with\Nit, Eddie, because I loved you. You "loved" me?\NWhat is that supposed to mean? What you did\Ngot me fired. You used me. Annie? Annie. Oh, my God. You're beautiful. Test 36. Biological interactions between two different organisms. These creatures need to bond\Nwith a respiratory host in order to survive\Nfor any amount of time in an oxygen-rich environment. Well, why are\Nall these hosts showing this hyper-acute\Nrejection? That's what\Nwe're trying to find out. The bonding process\Nis starting. It's equalizing. But why? Why this rabbit? - It's similar to an organ transplant.\N- Huh. Where the donor and recipient\Nmust be an exact match? - That's correct.\N- Okay. So wait, think about it. If we do achieve symbiosis, they\Nshould be able to survive here, but also we would\Nbe able to survive there. "We"? - Begin human trials.\N- Oh, it's way too soon to even begin to think\Nabout something like... Dr. Skirth, you're at the forefront\Nof a scientific breakthrough. I need you to hold your nerve.\NAll right? I understand,\Nbut it's an ethical question. Think of future generations.\NThink of your kids. Hey, how are your kids? Let's begin human trials. Good work. Hey, Jack. Do you ever feel\Nlike your life - is like one monumental screwup?\N- Nope. <i>Here at the Life Foundation,</i> - <i>we've always believed...</i>\N- Isn't that your buddy? <i>...in finding the lessons\Nin our disappointments.</i> <i>In the months\Nsince our rocket failed,</i> <i>we've learned so much.</i> Do you think we could,\Nlike, switch him off?

Yeah, we're empty. Cost you $5. $5 for a paper that's free? I walked all the way over\Nto the vending machine, got the papers out and\Nbrought 'em back over here, so you can have 'em\Npersonally delivered to you. You did that for me? - Yes, I did.\N- Oh. - Five bucks.\N- That's pretty steep. Tell you what, you give\Nme a dollar for a song, I'll throw in the paper.

Hey, Mrs. Chen. - How you doing, Eddie?\N- Ah, aches and pains, you know, aches and pains. You look like shit. Excuse me? You look like shit. And you look\Nas beautiful as ever. - Jesus.\N- Mind is body, Eddie. Have you been meditating\Nlike I showed you? - No, I have not. And it does not work.\N- It doesn't work, - because you don't give it a chance.\N- No, it doesn't work, because I bought a DVD off your\Ncousin, and it was in Mandarin. Yeah, I don't understand that, either. See, that right there, I don't\Nunderstand what you just said. That is the problem. Bottle of whiskey,\Nand don't forget my change. Please. Let's go.

You know, it's a really\Ninteresting story, but we need to just get to the\Npart where he's killing people. Drake sent a ship\Non a recon mission. On the way back,\Nthey found a comet. A comet?

You're talking about aliens? Like, aliens? E.T. phone home. Aliens, yeah. Yes. But we don't\Ncall them that. - We call them Symbiotes.\N- Symbiotes? And they cannot survive in\Nour environment without help. Drake believes that the union\Nbetween human and Symbiote is the key to our survival,\Nbut not here on Earth. Drake is trying to put human\Nbeings and aliens together? So they can live in space? We call them hosts. That's nuts, isn't it?\NThat's completely insane. Yes. There's no protocol\Nfor this thing.

We just did.</i> <i>Uh, well, Eddie,\Nit sounds like</i> it might be causing\Nsome metabolic abnormalities that are making it hard for your\Nbody to maintain homeostasis. You said "causing" and "body,"\Nand... I lost you. Listen, Eddie, um, we are\Ngonna get you on some meds, and we are gonna\Nclear that out. - Yes.\N- <i>Never gonna happen.</i> Will you stop doing that now.\NNot now. - Eddie, we're just trying to help you.\N- <i>I know.</i> I know. I'm just, I'm not\Nactually talking to you, Annie. Who are you talking to? I'm just gonna call you back,\Nall right? Thank you. Thank you, Dan.\NThank you. Thank you, both. Yeah? Hey, can you turn\Nyour music down, please? 'Cause I'm having\Na really hard time. Whatever. Yeah, sure, man. Yeah. - I'll just turn it right down. Sorry.\N- Thank you. Thank you. I was troubled by what we've been doing. I get it. We've all been troubled. It's the nature\Nof what we do. But I need you to tell me\Nwho was here with you. I need that from you. I can't do that. We can't fix things\Nunless we begin with your friend. The person who was here. Because they're gonna die.\NThey're in grave danger. You know that, right? They're gonna die unless\Nwe bring them back here, where you can help\Nto keep them alive. Hey. Dora. I promise, from here on in,\Nwe will do things differently. Will you trust me? Eddie Brock. - Eddie Brock?\N- Mmm-hmm. You were our best. Open it. No! No! No! No! No! <i>Do not open that door.</i> Huh? Stay put. - Hey, Eddie.\N- <i>Who the hell is this guy?</i> I'm gonna need\NMr. Drake's property back. Whoa. - <i>What are you doing?</i>\N- I'm, uh... I'm putting my hands up. <i>You are making us\Nlook bad.</i> I...\NNo, I am not. <i>Yes, you are.</i> - No, I'm not.\N- <i>Yes, you are!</i> - No, I'm not.\N- <i>Why would you do that?</i> 'Cause it is\Na very sensible thing to do. - Eddie...\N- <i>I will take care of this myself.</i> - What?\N- Eddie, where's the bug? Take him down. I'm so sorry\Nabout your friends. - What is that?\N- <i>Not "what." Who.</i> Oh. Shit. <i>Outstanding.</i> <i>Now let's bite all their heads off\Nand pile them up in the corner.</i> Why would we do that? <i>Pile of bodies, pile of heads.</i> What the shit, man? No! No, no, no! - What the hell?\N- Dude! How did you do that? Apparently, I have a parasite. Mr. Drake, our subject\Nis carrying the Symbiote. <i>Connecting you\Nto the feed now.</i> He's achieved symbiosis. Are you seeing this? Are you seeing this?\NHe's achieved symbiosis! Treece... Treece, bring me back\Nmy creature. <i>Eddie.</i> You're not even here, are you?\NI'm just seeing things. It's not real.\NYou're in my head. 'Cause you're just a parasite. "Parasite"? You have a brain tumor, Eddie. I got him. He's in the alley\Nbehind the Schueller Building. I am sorry that I\Ncalled you a parasite. We can discuss this\Nlike two men. What is that? What is that? What? Do not let him get away.\NDo you understand me, Treece? <i>Copy.\NWeapons are armed and ready.</i> Launch the drones. <i>Duck.</i> Whew! - Thank you.\N- <i>You are welcome.</i> Oh! This is beyond\Nanything we thought was possible. Oh, God, no! Holy shit! Treece, do not\Nlet him get away. I've got him.\NAll ground vehicles, move in. Target is now eastbound\Non Grant. Oh, God! Do something! What the... Oh, yeah! We got more friends.\NAwesome. No, no, no! No, no! No! You're out of your mind! No! - That is a dead-end!\N- <i>Not for us.</i> Whoa! Yeah! Whoa! I am going to die! <i>You are not\Ngoing to die!</i> Whoa! That was pretty cool,\Nactually. I'm not gonna lie... I got him. - <i>Bring him home.</i>\N- Copy that. This is incredible. You have been a serious\Npain in the ass for me, Eddie. Well, you know,\NI aim to please. Eyes, lungs, pancreas. So many snacks,\Nso little time. SFPD. Don't move! Get off the car! My legs. Oh, my God,\Nmy legs were broken. Now they're not broken.\NWhat is happening? What the hell\Nare you? I am Venom. And you are mine. You bit somebody's head off. Fuel in the tank. Listen carefully, Eddie. You did not find us. We found you. Think of yourself\Nas my ride. Where are you going? We need\NCarlton Drake's rocket. You remember him. How do you even know\Nabout that? - I know everything, Eddie.\N- You do? - Everything about you.\N- How? I am inside your head. You are a loser, Eddie. Are you gonna eat\Nanybody else? Most likely. Oh, God. That is why we are here. Cooperate,\Nand you might just survive. That is the deal. <i>Good\Nevening, ladies and gentlemen.</i> <i>Welcome to San Francisco.</i> <i>For your safety and comfort,\Nplease remain seated...</i> Hey, babe. I'm almost home. - <i>Where's Eddie?</i>\N- Why? What's happening? I got Eddie's labs back, and it's worse than I thought. His systems, renal, endocrine,\Nthey're behaving abnormally. <i>I've never seen\Nanything like it.</i> What does that mean, Dan?\NWhat are you telling me? - You need to get him here.\N- <i>My God.</i> - <i>Eddie Brock here. Leave a message.</i>\N- Shit. Where were you when\Nit left Dr. Skirth's body? - Where was he?\N- I was... This is the higher life-form. You\Nstood by and watched while it died. The arrogance. Treece, listen to me. After this,\Nwe can't risk killing Brock, not until we find\Nanother suitable host. I don't want to see you again\Nunless you have Brock! Officer, what's happening?\NI need to get in there. - It's my friend's apartment.\N- Building's been evacuated. It's not safe for you\Nto be here, ma'am. Found another one, Bill. Get off the streets.\NGo home. There's bodies\Nall over the city tonight. Bodies? My God, Eddie,\Nwhere are you? <i>Who is Anne?\NYour pulse has quickened.</i> That is none of your\Ngoddamn business. <i>Everything of yours\Nis my business, Eddie.</i> <i>We have no secrets.</i> Yeah? Well, then you know\Nexactly why I'm going here before we get to your rocket,\Nhuh? <i>Sure.\NI'm not unreasonable.</i> Shit. Yeah? Eddie. Thank God. Where are you?\NI need to see you. No, no, you can't see me. Eddie, I need you to tell me where you are.\NI'm coming to get you. No, you cannot come\Nanywhere near me. You cannot come\Nnear me right now. - Richard. Hey, Richard...\N- <i>No!</i> - Eddie?\N- <i>No, I gotta go up there.</i> You know you're not\Nsupposed to be here, Eddie. I got to get up there, man. Look, I got love for you, bro,\Nbut no can do. There's no such thing\Nas can't. I'm sorry, man. Okay, okay... Uh... Can you, uh,\Njust give him this? - He needs to see what's on it.\N- Eddie, please. I really need this job. - <i>Let's eat his brains.</i>\N- No! You do not touch him! - He is my friend.\N- What's wrong with you? He works three jobs just so\Nthat he can support his family. - Eddie, what's going on?\N- We're leaving. - <i>"We"?</i>\N- Yeah. - What are you talking about, "we"?\N- Just stay back! Yeah. - Shit.\N- <i>You want up?</i> <i>Well, why didn't you just say?</i> Hmm. - It is peaceful up here.\N- <i>I'm not very good with heights.</i> Your world is not so ugly\Nafter all. I'm almost sorry\Nto see it end. <i>What does that mean?</i> Where'd you go?\NWhere did you go? <i>I got us.</i> Whoa. Again?\NYou're gonna get me killed. <i>You die, I die.</i> Yeah, well, you can always\Njust shed my carcass and exchange it for another\None whenever you need. <i>Why would I do that?</i> <i>You are far too good of a\Nmatch to throw away so soon.</i> <i>Plus, I am starting\Nto like you.</i> <i>You and I\Nare not so different.</i> Thank you. Okay. Here's your evidence. <i>Jump.</i> <i>Pussy.</i> Hands! On the ground! Now! Guys, you do not want to do this.\NTrust me. - Mask!\N- Copy!

Move, move, move! <i>No! We do not\Neat policemen!</i> Annie! Annie, wait! - Wait, please.\N- Oh, what the hell is that? That's not me.\NI've been infected. - Eddie, what's happening?\N- He's inside me. - "He"?\N- Yes. - I know it sounds crazy, but...\N- You're sick. - Eddie, you're really sick.\N- No, I am scared! - And I need help.\N- Hospital. Right now. I can't go with you.\NIt's not safe. Get in the car, Eddie. - In the back.\N- <i>I like her. Get in.</i> I'm out of control. Dan just needs to do\Nanother MRI. - <i>No MRI.</i>\N- No. No. No MRI. What? Why? <i>Sound at 4,000\Nto 6,000 hertz is lethal.</i> Sound frequency in the MRI\Nis really harmful for him. What, so, sound\Nis like his kryptonite? - Not all sounds.\N- <i>And fire.</i> Fire. And fire.\NHe's talking to you? Always. - Are you in pain?\N- No. No, I don't feel anything,\Nactually, apart from... I'm hungry all the time. <i>And you feel sad, do you\Nnot, Eddie, when you are with her?</i> Get out of my head, man. <i>You never apologized.</i> <i>You might not live\Nto get another chance.</i> Annie. I just want to say\Nthat whatever happens, that I am truly sorry for whatever...\NAnd everything I have ever done to you. I am truly, truly sorry. And that I love you. Oh, Eddie... Now's really not the time. Let's\Njust keep you alive, okay? <i>Aw, that's nice.</i> You know, I'm really wet and\Ncold. Can I, uh, wear this? Yeah, yeah, you can wear\Nwhatever you want. Thank you. Hello? What are you doing here? Are you lost? I'm not lost. Thanks for coming in. - Eddie, I'm sorry.\N- What? Eddie, I got your labs back, and\Nyour heart has atrophied severely. <i>Do not listen to him.\NI can fix it.</i> I don't want you to fix it. <i>I can heal you.</i> Can you fix it? No. I've never seen\Nanything like this before. - This parasite, whatever this is...\N- <i>"Parasite"?</i> It's eating you\Nfrom the inside. Not a parasite.\NHe's not. - You're using him up.\N- <i>No. She is wrong.</i> - We need to get you to the ICU.\N- Wait. Shh! - I, Eddie, am I dying?\N- <i>No!</i> You're killing him. <i>They do not know\Nwhat they are talking about.</i> Listen,\Nwe don't have a lot of time... - Oh, God!\N- <i>We have to get out of here.</i> - Stop!\N- Oh, God, he's killing you. I'm killing you.\NI'm so sorry. No! Don't do that! Are you all right? Eddie, I'm sorry.\NI had to get him out of you. What is that? You were killing me? What happened to "we," man?\NWhat happened to "we"? Yeah, look at you now, huh?\NNow you're dying, too. We're done. - Where do you think you're going?\N- Anywhere other than here. You don't think we have\Na little problem on our hands? Wait, you're not gonna\Nleave me here with this thing. You want to tell me\Nwhat the hell's going on? I do. And you're right.\NWe do need to talk about it, but I don't know\Nmuch more than you do. I guess he had\Nno one else to turn to. He's a very complicated man.\NBut, Dan, I promise, there's nothing going on\Nbetween me and Eddie. I'm not talking\Nabout you and Eddie, Anne. - Oh.\N- I'm talking about that. Dan. Where is it? Eddie, Eddie, Eddie. You can kill me,\N'cause I'm dying anyway. I'm not just gonna kill you.\NThat wouldn't be any fun. No, no, no. I'm gonna rip your\Ntongue out of your face. Whoo! Stop. You're bleeding\Nall over my lab. Go. Go! - Where is he?\N- I don't know. And you know what? Even if I\Ndid, I wouldn't tell you anyway. I don't trust you,\Nand you're insane. - That hurts.\N- Sorry. Long journal entry\Nabout that tonight. You're being dumb, Brock.\NI'm not insane. What's insane is the way\Nhumans choose to live today. Think about it.\NAll we do is take, take, take. It can't go on. We've brought the planet\Nto the brink of extinction. We're parasites.\NYou're a good example. Think about it.\NAll you do is take. You took my Symbiote. You\Ntake potshots at a great man - trying to get something done.\N- Who? Didn't you take from the\Nperson you loved the most, who trusted you the most?\NThat's insane. What I've initiated is a whole\Nnew world, a new species. Man and Symbiote combined. Let me tell you something, buddy.\NAll right? Just man-to-man. Because I have spent a significant\Namount of time, all right, with one of these creatures\Nup my ass. It's not a lot of fun. And then I find out,\Nall along, that they're killing you. This is the last time\NI'm asking you. - Where is my Symbiote?\N- I have no idea. - Where is he?\N- Oh, my God! Where's Venom? That is the ugliest-looking\Nthing I have ever seen. You know, Brock,\NI have no use for you. Treece! Come and clean up\Nyour mess. Whoa, he has one\Nup his ass, too. Your friends, the others, I apologize.\NI tried to keep them alive. There are more of us.\NMillions more. They will follow\Nwherever I lead. Where we lead. Yes, "we." But first,\Nwe must retrieve them. I can take care of that. Yeah, what you gonna do,\Nyou gonna walk me to death? Shut up. Not so tough\Nwithout your friend. Did your mama not love you? God damn it! I guess it\Npays to be a specialist, huh? You know, it doesn't matter\Nif you kill me anyway, because there's something\Nway bigger afoot in this world than you and me. Much bigger than me. And it's much,\Nmuch bigger than you. Karma's a bitch. I don't believe in karma. Oh! Ooh! Hi, Eddie. Whoa. Whoa... Oh... Mmm... Mmm! Oh, no. I just bit\Nthat guy's head off. I know, I know. I've been there, too.\NIt's not fun. - <i>The one with Drake is Riot.</i>\N- Who's Riot? <i>Riot is what you would call\Na team leader.</i> <i>He has an arsenal of weapons.</i> - Drake's got his own Symbiote.\N- <i>He is unstoppable.</i> - Oh, great.\N- <i>We have got to go!</i> Go where? Where we going? - Well, I'm coming with you.\N- <i>No!</i> <i>It's going to get ugly.</i> - Well, she can fight ugly. Trust me.\N- Yeah, I can fight ugly. Not today. Oh, that's bullshit! This is not a simulation. Well, the flight team\Naren't prepped yet. I'll be piloting\Nthe spacecraft. - You?\N- Yes, me. How long? We're loading the probe\Nand running diagnostics. But even fully automated, you\Ncan't pilot that craft all alone. I'm not alone. God damn it! What the hell\Nhappened there? We just left Annie. <i>It is not safe for her.</i> <i>If we do not stop Riot,</i> <i>he will come back here\Nwith millions more of my kind.</i> Millions? What, you were\Ngonna take the rocket, and you were gonna come back\Nhere with an invasion force? Then what were you gonna do,\Nyou were gonna go feed - on a whole planet?\N- <i>Yes!</i> <i>But it is\Ndifferent now, Eddie.</i> - <i>I have decided to stay.</i>\N- Wow! <i>On my planet, I am\Nkind of a loser, like you.</i> - <i>But here, we could be more.</i>\N- Excuse me? <i>And I'm getting to\Nlike it here.</i> Oh, you like us now,\Ndo you, huh? <i>However, there will be nothing left to\Nlike if we do not stop that rocket.</i> Oh, I see. Right. When it comes\Nto being completely annihilated, - then it's back to "we."\N- <i>It is "we."</i> <i>Like it or not, it is\Ngoing to take both of us.</i> Hey, come on, man.\NCut the bullshit. What really made you\Nchange your mind? You. You did, Eddie. Scrub diagnostics. - Sir?\N- Did you hear me? Initiate the launch. <i>T-minus\Nfive minutes to launch.</i> <i>Auto sequence has been\Ninitiated.</i> Oh, shit. <i>T-minus\Nfour minutes, 30 seconds.</i> <i>Oh, Jesus!\NYou can take this guy, right?</i> He has got shit\Nyou have never seen. <i>What does that mean?\NWhat are our chances?</i> Hmm. Pretty much zero. <i>Oh, fuck it. Well,\Nlet's go save the planet.</i> <i>T-minus four minutes.</i> <i>Initiate orbiter\Naerosurface profile.</i> Venom. Get in the rocket. No. We won't let you destroy\Nthis world. Then die. - <i>Holy shit!</i>\N- Told you. <i>T-minus three minutes.</i> You have a strong host. But not strong enough. <i>T-minus\Ntwo minutes, 30 seconds.</i> Eddie. Drake, stop! Told you I could fight ugly. <i>T-minus one minute.</i> You're too late. This is the next stage... You talk too much. <i>T-minus 30 seconds.</i> You are nothing. <i>Ten seconds.</i> <i>Nine...</i> <i>Eight...</i> <i>Seven...</i> <i>Six...</i> <i>Five...</i> <i>Four...</i> <i>Three...</i> <i>Two...</i> <i>One...</i> <i>Liftoff.</i> Traitor! Have a nice life. <i>Goodbye, Eddie.</i> Venom, no! Hmm. You're in luck. I've\Ndecided to work pro bono. I'm joining\Nthe public defenders' office. You're a good person, Annie. What about you?\NWhat are you gonna do? Uh, the network asked me\Nto bring the show back, and they want to start\Nwith a piece on Drake. Oh, wow, really?\NSo, what did you say? Uh, I'm not into it. I want to\Nconcentrate on the written word. I scored the interview\Nof a lifetime. - Oh, yeah? Who?\N- You're gonna have to read it. Oh! Like everyone else. Yeah. Hey, I'm sorry about Venom. Hey, um... Do you want to talk\Nabout that kiss? Oh, that? You call that a kiss...\NNo, that was... Uh, that was your\Nbuddy's idea. Oh, right. Well,\Nthat is good to know. - It did feel kind of great, though.\N- What? I mean, the... - The power?\N- Yeah. When it's, you know... - Inside you?\N- You know what I mean. Okay. - Hey, Eddie?\N- Mmm-hmm? We're not gonna\Ntell Dan about this. Okay? <i>Look at her. She has no\Nidea we are going to get her back.</i> No, I don't think so. - Sorry, what was that?\N- We're not gonna tell Dan. Eddie, is there something\Nyou want to tell me? - Nope.\N- <i>You belong with us, Annie.</i> Eddie, are you sure? Good Lord, look at that. - Look at the time.\N- I have to go. - Hey, it's nice seeing you.\N- Yeah. You take care, all right? - Yeah, you take care of yourself.\N- Bye. Hey. Don't give up on her. Either of you. We won't. - <i>Who is that guy?</i>\N- Okay. <i>Wait.\NThis thing looks delicious.</i> I have absolutely no problem\Nwith you sticking around, but if you do, we're gonna have to\Nhave some ground rules, all right? You cannot just go around eating\Nanybody that you want to. - <i>I cannot?</i>\N- No, you cannot. All right, we need to...\NWe need to reiterate this. There are good people\Nin this world, a lot of them. And then there are bad people. You have to tell\Nthe difference. The deal is, you will only\Never be allowed to touch, harm, hurt, possibly,\Nvery possibly, eat very, very bad people, but never, ever,\Never good people. All right? - <i>Fine.</i>\N- Good. <i>But how does one\Ntell the difference?</i> Well, it's super simple. I mean, you just have to... You\Ncan intuit it, you can sense it. Sometimes you can\Neven feel it. <i>Whatever you say.</i> <i>But can we get something to\Neat now?</i> <i>Otherwise, your liver, it's starting\Nto look really, really good and juicy.</i> Yeah. Definitely.\NI know a place down here. Hey, Mrs. C. How you doing, Eddie? Ain't nothing changed\Nbut the weather. You know. No. So, what culinary delights will\Ntickle the pickle tonight? <i>Tater tots\Nand chocolate.</i> Right. Okay, no problem. The payment's due, Chen. Please.\NI can't keep doing this. Now. - <i>Bad guy, right?</i>\N- Yep. You come in here again... In fact, you go anywhere in this\Ncity, preying on innocent people, and we will find you\Nand eat both your arms - and then both of your legs.\N- No, no. And then we will eat your face right\Noff your head. Do you understand? - Please...\N- Yes. So, you will be this armless,\Nlegless, faceless thing, won't you, rolling down the street,\Nlike a turd in the wind? - Do you feel me?\N- What the hell are you? We are Venom. - On second thought...\N- Please. Eddie? What was that? Oh... I have a parasite. Yeah.\NNight, Mrs. Chen. - <i>"Parasite"?</i>\N- Yeah. It's a term of endearment,\Nthat's all. - <i>Apologize!</i>\N- No. - <i>Apologize!</i>\N- All right, fine. I'm sorry. So, what do you\Nwant to do now? <i>The way I see it,\Nwe can do whatever we want.</i> I need you\Nto stay quiet. This is a "me" thing.\NIt is not a "we" thing. - You got that?\N- <i>Fine, but make it quick.</i> Open on five. Go. Opening up. You ask me, they're dumb\Nto let him call the shots. Second he asked\Nfor you to interview him, I'd have shut that\Nshit down. Oh, yeah, you know the FBI.\NThey're just taking advantage of the one and only time\Nhe'll ever speak to anyone. They're hoping that I might help them\Nidentify some additional bodies. FBI don't work up close\Nand personal with him. The FBI will have to identify you,\Nif you don't follow the rules. Hey, Red!\NI got a visitor for you. - Hi, Eddie.\N- Hey. Do you mind if we forego the whole\Ncreepy serial killer thing here? Sure, it's good with me. I mean, I can turn it on\Nif you want. I can talk about the Dadaist\Npatterns of arterial spray. I bet you can. Tough to see you\Nin this light, Eddie. Come on over. All right. I'm here. When I get out of here,\Nand I will, there's gonna be carnage.
