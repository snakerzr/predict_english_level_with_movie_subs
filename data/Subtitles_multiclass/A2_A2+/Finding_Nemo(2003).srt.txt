No, I see it.<br/>It's beautiful. So, Coral, when you said<br/>you wanted an ocean view... you didn't think you'd get<br/>the whole ocean, did you? [Sighs] Oh, yeah.<br/>A fish can breathe out here. Did your man deliver,<br/>or did he deliver? - My man delivered.<br/>- And it wasn't so easy. Because a lot of other clownfish<br/>had their eyes on this place. You better believe they did...<br/>every single one of them. Mm-hmm. You did good. And the neighborhood<br/>is awesome. [Chattering and laughing] [Snipping] So, you do like it, don't you? No, no. I do, I do.<br/>I really do like it. But, Marlin, I know that<br/>the drop off is desirable... with the great schools<br/>and the amazing view... but do we really need<br/>so much space? But do we really need<br/>so much space? Coral, honey, these are our kids<br/>we're talking about. They deserve the best.<br/>Look, look, look. They'll wake up,<br/>poke their little heads out... and they see a whale!<br/>Right by their bedroom window. And they see a whale!<br/>Right by their bedroom window. Shh. You'll wake the kids. Oh, right, right. Aw, look. They're dreaming. We still have to name them. You want to name<br/>all of them right now? All right, we'll name<br/>this half Marlin Junior... and this half Coral Junior. - OK, we're done.<br/>- I like Nemo. Nemo. We'll name one Nemo... but I'd like most of them<br/>to be Marlin Junior. Just think,<br/>in a couple of days... - we're going to be parents.<br/>- Yeah. What if they don't like me? - Marlin.<br/>- No, really. There's over 400 eggs.<br/>Odds are, one will like you. What? - You remember how we met?<br/>- I try not to. Well, I remember.<br/>"Excuse me, miss... "can you check and see<br/>if I have a hook in my lip?" You got a little closer<br/>because it was wiggling. - Get away, get away!<br/>- Here he is. Cutie's here. Where did everybody go? [Breathing heavily] [Marlin gasps] Coral, get inside the house. No, Coral, don't.<br/>They'll be fine. Just get inside...<br/>You, right now. [Roars] No! Ow! [Gasps] Oh! Ooh! Ooh! [Roar echoes] [Dramatic music playing] [Marlin mutters] Coral! [Panting] Coral? Coral? [Gasps] Coral? Coral? Coral? [Crying] Oh! Ohh. There, there, there. It's OK. Daddy's here. Daddy's got you. I promise, I will never<br/>let anything happen to you... Nemo. [Dramatic music playing] NEMO: First day of school! Wake up, wake up!<br/>First day of school. I don't want to go to school...<br/>five more minutes. Not you, Dad, me. - OK. Huh?<br/>- Get up, get up. It's time for school,<br/>time for school. All right, I'm up. Whoa! [Thud] - Nemo!<br/>- First day of school! - Nemo, don't move.<br/>- Unh! Unh! You'll never get out<br/>of there yourself. I'll do it. Unh! [Pop] - You feel a break?<br/>- No. Sometimes you can't tell<br/>'cause fluid rushes to the area. - Are you woozy?<br/>- No. - How many stripes do I have?<br/>- I'm fine. - Answer the stripe question.<br/>- Three. No! See?<br/>Something's wrong with you. I have one, two, three...<br/>That's all I have? You're OK.<br/>How's the lucky fin? - Lucky.<br/>- Let's see. [Grunts] Are you sure you want to go<br/>to school this year? There's no problem if you don't.<br/>You can wait 5 or 6 years. Come on, Dad,<br/>it's time for school. - Forgot to brush.<br/>- Ohh. Do you want this anemone<br/>to sting you? - Yes.<br/>- Brush. - OK, I'm done.<br/>- You missed a spot. - Where?<br/>- There. - Where?<br/>- There. Ha ha! Right there.<br/>And here and here. [Music playing] All right, we're excited. All right, we're excited. The first day of school.<br/>Here we go. We're ready to learn<br/>to get some knowledge. What's the one thing we have<br/>to remember about the ocean? - It's not safe.<br/>- That's my boy. First, we check to see<br/>that the coast is clear. We go out... and back in. And then we go out...<br/>and back in. And then one more time...<br/>out and back in. And sometimes, if you want<br/>to do it four times... - Dad...<br/>- All right, come on, boy. Maybe while I'm at school,<br/>I'll see a shark. - I highly doubt that.<br/>- Have you ever met a shark? No, and I don't plan to. - How old are sea turtles?<br/>- I don't know. Sandy Plankton<br/>from next door... he says that sea turtles live<br/>to be about 100 years old. He says that sea turtles live<br/>to be about 100 years old. If I ever meet a sea turtle,<br/>I'll ask him. After I'm done<br/>talking to the shark, OK? Whoa! Hold on.<br/>Wait to cross. Whoa! Hold on.<br/>Wait to cross. Hold my fin. Dad, you're not<br/>going to freak out... like you did at<br/>the petting zoo, are you? MARLIN:<br/>That snaiI was about to charge. Hmm. I wonder where<br/>we're supposed to go. ALL: Bye, Mom! I'll pick you up after school. Ha ha! Come on, you guys, stop it!<br/>Give it back! Come on,<br/>we'll try over there. [Laughing] Excuse me, is this where<br/>we meet his teacher? Well, look who's out<br/>of the anemone. Yes. Shocking, I know. Yes. Shocking, I know. - Marty, right?<br/>- Marlin. - Bob.<br/>- Ted. Bill.<br/>Hey, you're a clownfish. You're funny, right?<br/>Tell us a joke. - Yeah.<br/>- Yeah. Well, actually,<br/>that's a common misconception. Clownfish are no funnier<br/>than any other fish. - Come on, clownie.<br/>- Do something funny. All right, I know one joke. There's a mollusk, see?<br/>And he walks up to a sea... He doesn't walk up,<br/>he swims up. Actually,<br/>the mollusk isn't moving. He's in one place,<br/>and then the sea cucumber... Well, they... I'm mixed up. There was a mollusk<br/>and a sea cucumber. None of them were walking,<br/>so forget that l... None of them were walking,<br/>so forget that l... Sheldon! Get out of<br/>Mr. Johannsen's yard now! - Whoa!<br/>- All right, you kids! Ooh, where'd you go? Dad, can I go play, too?<br/>Can I? I would feel better if<br/>you'd play on the sponge beds. [Squishing] [Thud] [Cries] That's where I would play. [Laughing] - What's wrong with his fin?<br/>- He looks funny. Ow! Hey, what'd I do? Be nice.<br/>It's his first time at school. He was born with it.<br/>We call it his lucky fin. - Dad...<br/>- See this tentacle? It's actually shorter<br/>than all my other tentacles... but you can't really tell. Especially when<br/>I twirl them like this. I'm H-2-O intolerant. - Ah-choo!<br/>- I'm obnoxious. <i>Oh <i>Let's name the zones,</i><br/><i>the zones, the zones <i>Let's name</i><br/><i>the zones of the open sea KIDS: Mr. Ray! - Come on, Nemo.<br/>- You better stay with me. <i>Mesopelagic, bathyal,</i><br/><i>abyssalpelagic <i>All the rest are too deep</i><br/><i>for you and me to see Huh.

Who is this?<br/>- I'm Nemo. Nemo, all new explorers<br/>must answer a science question. - OK.<br/>- You live in what kind of home? An anemon-none. A nemenem-menome. OK, don't hurt yourself.<br/>Welcome aboard, explorers. Just so you know,<br/>he's got a little fin. I find if he's having<br/>trouble swimming... I let him take a break,<br/>10, 15 minutes. NEMO: Dad, it's time<br/>for you to go now. Don't worry. We're gonna<br/>stay together as a group. OK, class,<br/>optical orbits up front. And remember, we keep<br/>our supraesophogeal ganglion... to ourselves.<br/>That means you, Jimmy. JIMMY: Aw, man! JIMMY: Aw, man! Bye, Nemo! Bye, Dad! Bye, son! Be safe. You're doing pretty well<br/>for a first-timer. You can't hold on to them<br/>forever, can you? I had a tough time with<br/>my oldest out at the drop off. They got to grow up...<br/>The drop off? They're going to the drop off?<br/>What are you, insane? Why don't we fry them up now<br/>and serve them with chips? Hey, Marty, calm down. Don't tell me<br/>to be calm, pony boy. Pony boy? For a clownfish,<br/>he really isn't that funny. Pity. <i>Oh <i>Let's name the species,</i><br/><i>the species, the species <i>Let's name the species</i><br/><i>that live in the sea NEMO: Whoa. <i>There's <i>Porifera, coelenterata,</i><br/><i>hydrozoa, scyphozoa <i>Anthozoa, ctenophora,</i><br/><i>bryozoas, three <i>Gastropoda, arthropoda,</i><br/><i>echinoderma <i>And some fish</i><br/><i>like you and me Come on, sing with me. <i>Oh [Continues singing indistinctly] [Dramatic music playing] [Dramatic music playing] <i>Just the girls this time. <i>Oh, seaweed is cool <i>Seaweed is fun <i>It makes its food OK, the drop off.

Oh, yeah?<br/>Let's see you get closer. OK. Beat that. Come on, Nemo.<br/>How far can you go? My dad says it's not safe. - Nemo! No!<br/>- Dad? You were about<br/>to swim into open water. No, I wasn't... Good thing I was here.<br/>If I hadn't shown up... - He wasn't going to go.<br/>- He was too afraid. No, I wasn't. This does not<br/>concern you, kids... and you're lucky<br/>I don't tell your parents. You know you can't swim well. I can swim fine, Dad, OK? No, it's not OK.<br/>You shouldn't be near here. OK, I was right. You'll start<br/>school in a year or two. No, Dad! Just because<br/>you're scared of the ocean... Clearly, you're not ready... Clearly, you're not ready... and you're not coming back<br/>untiI you are. You think<br/>you can do these things... but you just can't, Nemo! I hate you. <i>There's Nothing to see.<br/>Gather.

Short-term memory loss.<br/>I don't believe this. No, it's true. I forget things<br/>almost instantly. It runs in my family.<br/>At least, I think it does. Um, hmm. Where are they? Can I help you? Something's wrong<br/>with you... really. You're wasting my time. I have to find my son. [Gasps] Hello. - Ohh.<br/>- Well, hi! Name's Bruce. It's all right.<br/>I understand. Why trust a shark, right? [Laughs] So, what's a couple<br/>of bites like you... doing out so late, eh? We're not doing anything.<br/>We're not even out. Great!<br/>Then how'd you morsels... like to come to a little<br/>get-together I'm having? You mean, like a party? Yeah, right. A party.<br/>What do you say? I love parties.<br/>That sounds like fun. Parties are fun,<br/>and it's tempting, but... Oh, come on, I insist. MARLIN: OK.<br/>That's all that matters. <i>DORY: Hey, look, balloons.</i><br/><i>It is a party. BRUCE: Ha ha ha ha!<br/>Mind your distance, though. Those balloons<br/>can be a bit dodgy. You wouldn't want<br/>one of them to pop. [Dramatic music playing] [Gasps] MARLIN: Oh. <i>Ohh. Anchor! Chum! There you are, Bruce.<br/>Finally. - We got company.<br/>- It's about time, mate. We've already gone<br/>through the snacks... We've already gone<br/>through the snacks... <i>and I'm still starving. We almost had a feeding frenzy. Come on,<br/>let's get this over with. [Bell rings] <i>BRUCE: Right, then. The meeting has officially<br/>come to order. Let us all say the pledge. I am a nice shark,<br/>not a mindless eating machine. If I am to change this image... <i>I must first change myself. Fish are friends, not food. Except stinkin' dolphins. Dolphins. Yeah.<br/>They think they're so cute. "Look at me.<br/>I'm a flippin' little dolphin. "Let me flip for you.<br/>Ain't I something?" Right, then.<br/>Today's meeting is Step 5... Bring a Fish Friend. Do you all have your friends? Got mine. [Hyperventilating] - Hey, there.<br/>- How about you, Chum? Oh, I... seem to have<br/>misplaced my friend. [Marlin gasps] <i>BRUCE: That's all right, Chum. <i>I had a feeling</i><br/><i>this would be a difficult step. <i>You can help yourself</i><br/><i>to one of my friends. Thanks, mate.<br/>A little chum for Chum, eh? <i>BRUCE: I'll start</i><br/><i>the testimonies. Hello. My name is Bruce. BOTH: Hello, Bruce. It has been three weeks<br/>since my last fish. On my honor, or may I be<br/>chopped up and made into soup. - You're an inspiration!<br/>- Amen. [Grunts] Right, then. Who's next? DORY: Pick me, pick me. Yes. The little<br/>Sheila down the front. - Whoo!<br/>- Come on up here. Hi. I'm Dory. - Hello, Dory.<br/>- And, uh, well... I don't think<br/>I've ever eaten a fish. - That's incredible.<br/>- Good on you, mate. [Sighs] I'm glad<br/>I got that off my chest. All right, anyone else? How about you, mate?<br/>What's your problem? MARLIN: Me?<br/>I don't have a problem. Oh, OK. - Denial.<br/>- Aah! <i>BRUCE: Just start</i><br/><i>with your name. OK. Uh, hello. My name is Marlin.<br/>I'm a clownfish. - A clownfish? Really?<br/>- Tell us a joke. I love jokes. I actually do know one<br/>that's pretty good. There was this mollusk... and he walks up<br/>to a sea cucumber. Normally, they don't talk,<br/>sea cucumbers... but in a joke,<br/>everyone talks... so the sea mollusk<br/>says to the cucumber... [Dramatic music playing] NEMO: Daddy! Nemo! Nemo! Ha ha! Nemo!<br/>I don't get it. For a clownfish,<br/>he's not that funny. No, no, no, no.<br/>He's my son. He was taken by these divers. DORY: [Gasps]<br/>Oh, my. You poor fish. Humans... think they own<br/>everything. Probably American. Now, there is a father...<br/>Looking for his little boy. Now, there is a father...<br/>Looking for his little boy. MARLIN: What do<br/>these markings mean? [Sobs]<br/>I never knew my father! - Group hug.<br/>- We're all mates here, mate. I can't read human. DORY: We got to find a fish<br/>that can read this. - Hey, look, sharks.<br/>- No, no, no, Dory! - Guys, guys.<br/>- No, Dory. That's mine.<br/>Give it to me. Gimme! Ow! Oh, I'm sorry.<br/>Are you OK? - Ow, ow, ow.<br/>- I'm so sorry. You really clocked me there.<br/>Am I bleeding? - Ohh.<br/>- Ow, ow, ow. Dory, are you OK... Ohh. Ohh, that's good. Ohh, that's good. BOTH: Intervention! - Just a bite.<br/>- Hold it together, mate! Remember, Bruce,<br/>fish are friends, not food! - Food!<br/>- Dory, look out! - Food!<br/>- Dory, look out! - Aah!<br/>- I'm having fish tonight! Remember the steps, mate! MARLIN: Aah! - Aah! Whoa!<br/>- Aah! - Just one bite!<br/>- Aah! [Clanking] G'day. Grr! There's no way out! There's got to be a way<br/>to escape! [Clanging] Who is it? Dory, help me<br/>find a way out! Sorry. Come back later.<br/>We're trying to escape. [Clang] - There's got to be a way out!<br/>- Here's something. "Es-cap-e."<br/>I wonder what that means. Funny. It's spelled<br/>just like "escape." - Let's go.<br/>- Aah! Here's Brucey! Wait a minute.<br/>You can read? I can read?<br/>That's right. I can read! Well, then, here.<br/>Read this now. - Aah!<br/>- Ohh! He really doesn't mean it.<br/>He never even knew his father. <i>CHUM:</i><br/><i>Don't fall off the wagon! - Aah!<br/>- Aah! [Roars] Oh, no, it's blocked! [Grunting] No, Bruce, focus. Sorry about Bruce, mate. He's really a nice guy. I need to get that mask. You want that mask? OK. No, no, no, no, no, no! Quick, grab the mask! [Snarls] Oh, no. Bruce? [Sniffs] What? [Dramatic music playing] [Gasps]<br/>Swim away! Swim away! DORY:<br/>Aw, is the party over? [Dink, boom] [Explosions] [PIop] Nice.

Sometimes it's a good thing. There's a whole group of fish.<br/>They're delay fish. You mean... [Whimpers] You mean you don't like me? No, of course I like you. It's because I like you<br/>I don't want to be with you. It's a complicated emotion. - Ohh!<br/>- Don't cry. I like you. Hey, you!<br/>Lady, is this guy bothering you? Um...

You want to follow the E.A.C. That's the East<br/>Australian Current. Big current.<br/>Can't miss it. It's in... that direction. And then you follow that<br/>for about... I don't know.<br/>What do you guys think? About three leagues? That little baby will put you<br/>right past Sydney. - Ta-da!<br/>- That's great! Dory, you did it! Oh, please,<br/>I'm just your little helper. - Helping along. That's me.<br/>- Fellas, thank you. LEADER: Don't mention it!<br/>Just loosen up, OK, buddy? DORY: Oh, you guys.<br/>You really nailed him. Bye. LEADER: Oh, hey, ma'am.<br/>One more thing. When you come to this trench,<br/>swim through it, not over it.

Something's telling me<br/>to swim through it, not over it. Are you looking at this thing? It's got death<br/>written all over it. I really, really, really<br/>think we should swim through.

Something shiny! - Where?<br/>- It just swam over the trench. - Come on, we'll follow it!<br/>- OK! Boy, it sure is clear up here. Exactly. And look at that...<br/>there's the current. We should be there in no time. Hey, little guy. You wanted to go<br/>through the trench. I shall call him Squishy,<br/>and he shall be mine. And he shall be my Squishy.<br/>Come here, Squishy. Come here, little Squishy. [Baby talk] [Zap] Ow! - That's a jellyfish!<br/>- Bad Squishy! Shoo, shoo! Get away! - Let me see that.<br/>- Don't touch it. I won't touch it.<br/>I just want to look. Hey! How come<br/>it didn't sting you? It did.<br/>It's just that... - Ow! Ow! Ow!<br/>- Hold still. I live in this anemone... and I'm used<br/>to these kind of stings. Ow! Ow! Ow! It doesn't look bad.<br/>You'll be fine. But now we know, don't we... that we don't want<br/>to touch these again. Let's be thankful this time<br/>it was just a little one. - Aah!<br/>- Aah!

Pick me!<br/>- Here's the game. Whoever can hop the fastest<br/>out of these jellyfish wins! - OK.<br/>- Rules, rules, rules! You can't touch the tentacles.<br/>Only the tops. Something about tentacles.<br/>Got it. Go! Wait! Not something about 'em,<br/>it's all about 'em! - Whee!<br/>- Wait, Dory! Gotta go faster<br/>if you want to win! Gotta go faster<br/>if you want to win! Whoa! Dory! Boing, boing, boing! Wait a minute! Whoa! Dory! Whee! We're cheating death now.<br/>That's what we're doing. But we're having fun<br/>at the same time. I can do this.<br/>Just be careful. Yeah, careful I don't<br/>make you cry when I win! I don't think so! Ha ha ha ha! Whoa! Give it up, old man. You can't fight evolution.<br/>I was buiIt for speed. The question is, Dory,<br/>are you hungry? - Hungry?<br/>- Yeah. 'Cause you're about<br/>to eat my bubbles! Duck to the left!<br/>Right there! The clownfish is the winner! Whoo-hoo! We did it!<br/>Look at us! Dory? Oh, no. Dory! Dory! Dory! [Gasps] Dory! [Electricity surging]<br/>Ohh! [Screams] DORY: Am I disqualified? MARLIN: No, you're doing fine!<br/>You're actually winning! But you gotta stay awake.<br/>Where does P. Sherman live? DORY: P. Sherman...<br/>Wallaby Way, Sydney... MARLIN: That's it! [Electrical shock]<br/>Uhh! - Wallaby Way...<br/>- Uhh! Stay awake! Stay awake!<br/>Ooh! Stay awake! Stay... awake! - Awake.<br/>- P. Sherman. - Awake.<br/>- 42 Wallaby Way. Wake up. Nemo... Wake up. Nemo... You miss your dad,<br/>don't you, Sharkbait? Yeah. Yeah. You're lucky to have someone<br/>out there looking for you. He's not looking for me. He's scared of the ocean. Peach, any movement? He's had four cups of coffee.<br/>It's gotta be soon. Keep on him. My first escape...<br/>landed on dental tools. I was aiming for the toilet. Toilet? All drains<br/>lead to the ocean, kid. Wow. How many times have<br/>you tried to get out? Ah, I've lost count. Fish aren't meant<br/>to be in a box, kid. It does things to you. [Laughing]<br/>Bubbles! Bubbles! Potty break! He grabbed<br/>the "Reader's Digest." - We have 4.2 minutes!<br/>- That's your cue, Sharkbait. - You can do it, kid.<br/>- We gotta be quick. Once you get in, swim to<br/>the bottom of the chamber... Once you get in, swim to<br/>the bottom of the chamber... and I'll talk you<br/>through the rest. - OK.<br/>- It'll be a piece of kelp. [Inhales deeply] [Grunting] Nicely done! - Can you hear me?<br/>- Yeah! Here comes the pebble. Ptoo. [Splish] Now, do you see<br/>a small opening? Uh-huh! <i>Inside it,</i><br/><i>you'll see a rotating fan. <i>Wedge that pebble into the fan</i><br/><i>to stop it turning. [Whirring] [Buzz] Aah! - Careful, Sharkbait!<br/>- I can't do it! Gill, this isn't a good idea. He'll be fine. Try again! OK. <i>GILL: That's it, Sharkbait. <i>Nice and steady. I got it!

I know that dude!<br/>It's the Jellyman! DORY: Go on. Jump on him! - Turtle pile!<br/>- Wait, wait, wait! - Are you funny?<br/>- Where's your shell? - I need to breathe!<br/>- Are you running away? Did you really cross<br/>the jellyfish forest? - Did they sting you?<br/>- One at a time! Mr. Fish, did you die? DORY: Sorry, I was<br/>a little vague on the detaiIs. So, where are you going? You see, my son was taken. My son was taken away from me. - No way.<br/>- What happened? No, no, kids.<br/>I don't want to talk about it. ALL: Aww! Please? Please? [Sighs] Well, OK. I live on this reef<br/>a long, long way from here. This is gonna be good.<br/>I can tell. And my son Nemo... See, he was mad at me. And maybe he wouldn't<br/>have done it... if I hadn't been<br/>so tough on him. I don't know. Anyway, he swam out in<br/>the open water to this boat... and when he was out there,<br/>these divers appeared... and I tried to stop them,<br/>but the boat was too fast. So, we swam out in the ocean<br/>to follow them... They couldn't stop 'em.<br/>And then Nemo's dad... he swims out to the ocean,<br/>and they bump into... ...three ferocious sharks. He scares away the sharks<br/>by blowing 'em up! Golly, that's amazing. And then dives<br/>thousands of feet... ...straight down<br/>into the dark. It's wicked dark down there. You can't see a thing.<br/>How's it going, Bob? And the only thing<br/>they can see down there... ...is the light from<br/>this big, horrible creature... with razor-sharp teeth.<br/>Nice parry, old man. And then he has<br/>to blast his way... So, these two little fish<br/>have been... searching the ocean for days<br/>on the East Australian Current. Which means that he may be<br/>on his way here right now. That should put him<br/>in Sydney Harbor... ...in a matter of days.<br/>I mean, it sounds like... this guy is gonna<br/>stop at nothing... ...till he finds his son.<br/>I sure hope he makes it. That's one dedicated father,<br/>if you ask me. GULLS: Mine! Mine!<br/>Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine!<br/>Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine!<br/>Mine! Mine! Mine! Would you just shut up?! You're rats with wings! Bloke's been looking<br/>for his boy Nemo. - Nemo?!<br/>- He was taken off the reef... - Take it! You happy?<br/>- Mine! Mine! Mine! Hey, say that again!<br/>Something about Nemo. Mine! Mine! Mine! Whoooa... Hyah! Mine? Last I heard, he's heading<br/>towards the harbor. Ho ho! BriIliant! [Music swells] [Sighs] Is he doing OK? Is he doing OK? Whatever you do,<br/>Don't mention D-a-r... It's OK. I know who<br/>you're talking about. [Smack] [Bubbling] Gill? Gill? Hey, Sharkbait. I'm sorry I couldn't stop the... <i>No, I'm the one</i><br/><i>who should be sorry. I was so ready<br/>to get out... so ready to taste that ocean... <i>I was willing to put you</i><br/><i>in harm's way to get there. Nothing should be worth that. I'm sorry I couldn't get you<br/>back to your father, kid. [Panting] All right.<br/>Hey, hey, hey... - What the...<br/>- Aaah! That's one way to pull a tooth.<br/>[Chuckles] Huh. Darn kids. Good thing I pulled the<br/>right one, eh, Prime Minister? NIGEL: Hey, psst! PEACH: Oh, Nigel!<br/>You just missed an extraction. Has he loosened<br/>the periodontal ligament yet? What am I talking about?<br/>Where's Nemo? - I've got to speak with him.<br/>- What is it? Your dad's been fighting<br/>the entire ocean... - Iooking for you.<br/>- My father? Really? He's traveled hundreds of miles,<br/>battling sharks and jellyfish... Sharks? That can't be him. What was his name?<br/>Some sort of sport fish. - Tuna? Trout?<br/>- Marlin? Marlin! The little clownfish<br/>from the reef. It's my dad!<br/>He took on a shark! I heard he took on three. - Three sharks?<br/>- That's 4,800 teeth! After you were taken<br/>by Diver Dan over there... your dad followed the boat<br/>like a maniac. Really? He's swimming,<br/>giving it all he's got... and then three gigantic<br/>sharks capture him... and he blows them up<br/>and dives thousands of feet... and gets chased by a monster<br/>with huge teeth! He ties this demon to a rock,<br/>and what's his reward? He gets to battle<br/>an entire jellyfish forest! Now he's with a bunch of<br/>sea turtles on the E.A. C... and the word is he's headed<br/>this way right now... to Sydney! - Wow!<br/>- What a good daddy! He was looking for you<br/>after all, Sharkbait. [Gasps] [Clatters] <i>GURGLE:</i><br/><i>He's swimming to the filter! - Sharkbait!<br/>- Not again! [Spits] Sharkbait! No!

Nemo! Can you hear me? Yeah, I can hear you. Sharkbait, you did it! Sharkbait, you're...<br/>covered with germs! Aah! Ha ha!<br/>That took guts, kid. All right, gang,<br/>we have less than 48 hours... before Darla gets here. This tank'll get<br/>plenty dirty in that time... but we have to help it along<br/>any way we can. - Jacques?

MARLIN:<br/>The swirling vortex of terror? - That's it, dude.<br/>- Of course it is. OK, first,<br/>find your exit buddy. Do you have your exit buddy? Yes! Squirt give you a rundown<br/>of proper exiting technique. Good afternoon!<br/>We'll have a great jump today! OK, crank a hard cutback<br/>as you hit the wall. There's a screaming bottom turn,<br/>so watch out! Remember...<br/>rip it, roll it, and punch it! He's trying to speak to me,<br/>I know it!
