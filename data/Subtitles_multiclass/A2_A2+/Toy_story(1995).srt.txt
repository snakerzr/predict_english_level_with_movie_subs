I'm sure Andy was just\Na little excited, that's all. Too much cake and ice cream,\NI suppose. It's just a mistake! Well, that mistake is sitting\Nin your spot, Woody. -Have you been replaced?\N-What did I tell you earlier? No one is getting replaced. Now, let's all be polite and give\Nwhatever it is up there a nice, big\NAndy's-room welcome. Buzz Lightyear to Star Command. Come in, Star Command. Star Command, come in.\NDo you read me? Why don't they answer? My ship! Blast! This'll take weeks to repair. Buzz Lightyear mission log,\Nstardate 4-0-7-2. My ship has run off course\Nen route to sector 1 2. I've crash-landed\Non a strange planet. The impact must've awoken me\Nfrom hypersleep. Terrain seems a bit unstable. No readout yet\Nif the air is breathable. And there seems to be no sign\Nof intelligent life anywhere. Hello! Whoa! Hey!\NWhoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Did I frighten you? Didn't mean to. Sorry. Howdy. My name is Woody. And this is Andy's room.\NThat's all I wanted to say. And also, there has been\Na bit of a mix-up. This is my spot, see,\Nthe bed here. Local law enforcement.\NIt's about time you got here. I'm Buzz Lightyear, Space Ranger,\NUniverse Protection Unit. My ship has crash-landed here\Nby mistake. Yes, it is a mistake because,\Nyou see, the bed here is my spot. I need to repair\Nmy turbo boosters. Do you people still use fossil fuel, or\Nhave you discovered crystallic fusion? Well, let's see. We got double-A's. Watch yourself!\NHalt! Who goes there? Don't shoot!\NIt's okay. Friends. -Do you know these life-forms?\N-Yes! They're Andy's toys. All right, everyone,\Nyou're clear to come up. I am Buzz Lightyear.\NI come in peace. Oh, I'm so glad\Nyou're not a dinosaur! Wh-why, thank you! Now, thank you all\Nfor your kind welcome! -Say, what's that button do?\N-I'll show you. Buzz Lightyear to the rescue! Hey, Woody's got something like that.\NHis is a pull string. -Only it's...\N-Only it sounds like a car ran over it. Oh, yeah, but not like this.\NThis is a quality sound system. Probably all copper wiring, huh? So, where you from?\NSingapore? Hong Kong? Well, no. Actually, I'm stationed up\Nin the Gamma Quadrant of Sector Four. As a member of the elite\NUniverse Protection Unit of the Space Ranger Corps, I protect the galaxy\Nfrom the threat of invasion from the evil Emperor Zurg,\Nsworn enemy of the Galactic Alliance. Oh, really?\NI'm from Playskool. And I'm from Mattel.\NWell, I'm not really from Mattel. I'm actually from a smaller company that was purchased\Nin a leveraged buyout. You'd think they'd never seen\Na new toy before. Well, sure. Look at him. He's got more gadgets on him\Nthan a Swiss Army knife. Please be careful. You don't want to be in the way\Nwhen my laser goes off. Hey, a laser! How come\Nyou don't have a laser, Woody? It's not a laser! It's a...\NIt's a little light bulb that blinks. -What's with him?\N-Laser envy. All right, that's enough! Look, we're all very impressed\Nwith Andy's new toy. -Toy?\N-T-O-Y. Toy! Excuse me, I think the word\Nyou're searching for is "Space Ranger." The word I'm searching for I can't say\Nbecause there's preschool toys present. Gettin' kinda tense, aren't ya? Mr Lightyear, now, I'm curious. What does a Space Ranger\Nactually do? He's not a Space Ranger! He doesn't fight evil\Nor, or shoot lasers or fly! Excuse me. Oh, impressive wingspan!\NVery good! Oh, what? What?\NThese are plastic. He can't fly! They are a terillium-carbonic alloy,\Nand I can fly. -No, you can't.\N-Yes, I can. -You can't.\N-Can. Can't. Can't. Can't! I tell you, I could fly around\Nthis room with my eyes closed! -Okay, then, Mr Light Beer, prove it.\N-All right, then, I will. Stand back, everyone! To infinity and beyond! -Can!\N-Whoa! Oh, wow, you flew magnificently! -I found my movin' buddy.\N-Thank you. Thank you all. Thank you. That wasn't flying!\NThat was... falling with style. Man, the dolls must really\Ngo for you. Can you teach me that? -Golly bob howdy!\N-Oh, shut up! You know, in a couple of days, everything will be just the way\Nit was. They'll see. They'll see. I'm still Andy's favourite toy. I was on top of the world\Nlivin' high It was right in my pocket I was livin' the life Things were just the way\Nthey should be When from out of the sky\Nlike a bomb Comes some little punk\Nin a rocket Now all of a sudden some\Nstrange things are happening to me Buzz Lightyear to the rescue! Strange Things are happening to me Strange Things Strange things are happening to me Ain't no doubt about it I had friends\NI had lots of friends Now all my friends are gone And I'm doin' the best I can To carry on -I had power\N-Power -I was respected\N-Respected But not any more And I've lost the love of the one Whom I adore Let me tell you 'bout it\NStrange Things are happenin' to me Strange Things Strange Things are happenin' to me Ain't no doubt about it Strange Things Strange Things Finally! Hey, who's got my hat? Look, I'm Woody!\NHowdy, howdy, howdy! Gimme that! Say there, Lizard and Stretchy Dog,\Nlet me show you something. It looks as though I've been\Naccepted into your culture. Your chief, Andy,\Ninscribed his name on me. Wow! With permanent ink too! Well, I must get back\Nto repairing my ship. Don't let it get to you, Woody. Let what? I don't...\NWhat do you mean? Who? I know Andy's\Nexcited about Buzz. But you know he'll always have\Na special place for you. -Yeah, like the attic.\N-All right, that's it! Unidirectional bonding strip. Mr Lightyear wants more tape. Listen, Light Snack,\Nyou stay away from Andy. He's mine, and no one\Nis taking him away from me. What are you talking about? Where's that bonding strip? And another thing, stop with this spaceman thing!\NIt's getting on my nerves! Are you saying you wanna lodge\Na complaint with Star Command? Okay! Well, so you wanna\Ndo it the hard way, huh? -Don't even think about it, cowboy.\N-Oh, yeah, tough guy? The air isn't... toxic. How dare you open a spaceman's\Nhelmet on an uncharted planet! My eyeballs could've been\Nsucked from their sockets! You actually think\Nyou're the Buzz Lightyear? Oh, all this time\NI thought it was an act! Hey, guys, look!\NIt's the real Buzz Lightyear! You're mocking me,\Naren't you? Oh, no, no. No, no, no, no, no.\NBuzz, look, an alien! Where? Yes! It's Sid! Don't move! I thought he was at summer camp. They must've kicked him out\Nearly this year. Oh, no, not Sid! Incoming! -Who is it this time?\N-I... I can't... I can't tell. -Hey, where's Lenny?\N-Right here, Woody. Oh, no, I can't bear to watch\None of these again. Oh, no, it's a Combat Carl. What's going on? Nothing that concerns you spacemen,\Njust us toys. I'd better take a look anyway. Why is that soldier\Nstrapped to an explosive device? That's why, Sid. Sure is a hairy fellow. No, no, that's Scud, you idiot. That is Sid. -You mean that happy child?\N-That ain't no happy child. He tortures toys, just for fun! Well, then we've got\Nto do something. What are you doing?\NGet down from there! -I'm gonna teach that boy a lesson.\N-Yeah, sure. You go ahead. Melt him with your scary laser. Be careful with that!\NIt's extremely dangerous. He's lighting it!\NHe's lighting it! Hit the dirt! Look out! Yes! He's gone! He's history! I could've stopped him. Buzz, I would love\Nto see you try. Of course, I'd love\Nto see you as a crater. The sooner we move, the better. Yeah! To infinity and beyond! All this packing\Nmakes me hungry. What would you say to dinner\Nat, oh, Pizza Planet? Pizza Planet? Oh, cool! Go wash your hands,\Nand I'll get Molly ready. -Can I bring some toys?\N-You can bring one toy. -Just one?\N-One toy? Will Andy pick me? "Don't count on it"? Buzz! Oh, Buzz!\NBuzz Lightyear. Buzz Lightyear, thank goodness.\NWe've got trouble! -Trouble? Where?\N-Down there. Just down there. A helpless toy, it's...\Nit's trapped, Buzz! Then we've no time to lose. I don't see anything! Oh, he's there!\NJust, just keep looking! What kind of toy... Buzz! Buzz! I don't see him in the driveway. -I think he bounced into Sid's yard!\N-Oh! Buzz! Hey, everyone, R.C.'s trying to\Nsay something. What is it, boy? -He's saying that this was no accident.\N-What do you mean? -I mean Humpty-Dumpty was pushed...\N-No! ...by Woody! -What?\N-Wait a minute. You don't think I meant to knock Buzz\Nout the window, do you? Potato Head? That's Mr Potato Head to you,\Nyou back-stabbing murderer! Now, it was an accident, guys. Come on.\NNow, you, you gotta believe me. We believe ya, Woody.\NRight, Rex? Well, ye... N...\NI don't like confrontations! Where is your honour, dirt bag?\NYou are an absolute disgrace! You don't deserve to... Hey! You couldn't handle Buzz cutting\Nin on your playtime, could you, Woody? Didn't wanna face the fact that Buzz\Njust might be Andy's new favourite toy. So you got rid of him. Well, what ifAndy starts playing\Nwith me more, Woody, huh? You gonna knock me\Noutta the window too? I don't think we should\Ngive him the chance. There he is, men. Frag him! Let's string him up\Nby his pull string! -I got dibs on his hat!\N-Would you boys stop it! Tackle him! No, no, no! Wait!\NI can explain everything! Okay, Mom, be right down.\NI've gotta get Buzz. Retreat! Mom, do you know\Nwhere Buzz is? No, I haven't seen him. -Andy, I'm heading out the door!\N-But, Mom, I can't find him! Honey, just grab some other toy.\NNow, come on! Oh, okay. I couldn't find my Buzz.\NI know I left him right there. Honey, I'm sure he's around.\NYou'll find him. It's too short!\NWe need more monkeys! There aren't any more!\NThat's the whole barrel! Buzz, the monkeys\Naren't working! We're formulating another plan!\NStay calm! Oh, where could he be? -Can I help pump the gas?\N-Sure! I'll even let you drive. -Yeah?\N-Yeah, when you're 1 6. Funny, Mom. Great. How am I gonna convince\Nthose guys it was an accident? Buzz! Buzz! Ha! You're alive! This is great!\NOh, I'm saved! I'm saved. Andy'll find you here,\Nhe'll take us back to the room and then you can tell everyone\Nthat this was all just a big mistake. Huh? Right? Buddy? I just want you to know that even\Nthough you tried to terminate me, revenge is not an idea\Nwe promote on my planet. -Oh. Well, that's good.\N-But we're not on my planet, are we? No. Okay, come on! You want a piece of me? Buzz, Buzz,\NBuzz Lightyear to the rescue. -Next stop.\N-Pizza Planet! Yeah! Andy! Wh... Doesn't he realise\Nthat I'm not there? I'm lost! Oh, I'm a lost toy! Buzz Lightyear mission log. The local sheriff and I seem to be at\Na huge refuelling station of some sort. You! -According to my navi-computer, the...\N-Shut up! -Just shut up, you idiot!\N-Sheriff, this is no time to panic. This is the perfect time to panic.\NI'm lost. Andy is gone. They're gonna move from their house\Nin two days, and it's all your fault! My... My fault? If you hadn't pushed me\Nout of the window in the first place... Oh, yeah? Well, if you hadn't shown up in your\Nstupid little cardboard spaceship and taken away everything\Nthat was important to me... Don't talk to me\Nabout importance! Because of you the security\Nof this entire universe is in jeopardy! What? What are\Nyou talkin' about? Right now, poised at\Nthe edge of the galaxy, Emperor Zurg has been secretly building\Na weapon with the destructive capacity\Nto annihilate an entire planet! I alone have information that reveals\Nthis weapon's only weakness. And you, my friend,\Nare responsible for delaying my rendezvous\Nwith Star Command! You... are... a... toy! You aren't the real\NBuzz Lightyear! You're a... You're an action figure!\NYou are a child's plaything! You are a sad, strange little man,\Nand you have my pity. Farewell. Oh, yeah?\NWell, good riddance, ya loony! "Rendezvous with Star Command." -Hey, gas dude!\N-You talkin' to me? -Yeah, man. Can you help me?\N-Pizza Planet? Andy! Do you know\Nwhere Cutting Boulevard is? Oh, no! I can't show my face\Nin that room without Buzz. -Buzz! Buzz, come back!\N-Go away! No! Buzz, you gotta\Ncome back! I... I found a spaceship! It's a spaceship, Buzz! Come on, man, hurry up! Like,\Nthe pizzas are getting cold here! -Cutting Boulevard, huh?\N-Yeah, yeah. Which way? Now, you're sure this space freighter\Nwill return to its port of origin once it jettisons its food supply? And when we get there, we'll be able\Nto find a way to transport you home. -Well, then, let's climb aboard.\N-No, no, no, wait, Buzz! Buzz! Let's get in the back.\NNo one will see us there. Negative. There are no restraining\Nharnesses in the cargo area. -We'll be much safer in the cockpit.\N-Yeah, bu... Buzz! Buzz! That's two lefts\Nand a right, huh? -Thanks for the directions, okay?\N-Yeah. And remember, kid... Buzz! It's safer in the cockpit\Nthan the cargo bay. What an idiot. Next shuttle lift-off\Nis scheduled for T-minus 30 minutes and counting. You are clear to enter. Welcome to Pizza Planet. The white zone\Nis for immediate pizza... Sheriff! There you are. Now, the entrance is heavily guarded.\NWe need a way to get inside. Great idea, Woody. I like your thinkin'.
