How you doing, Keaton? I can't feel my legs... Keyser. Ready? What time is it? 12:30. It all started back in New York\Nsix weeks ago. A truck loaded with stripped gun parts\Ngot jacked outside of Queens. The driver didn't see anyone,\Nbut someone fucked up. He heard a voice.\NSometimes that's all you need. -Mr. McManus?\N-Christ! Don't you fucking guys ever sleep? -We have a warrant for your arrest.\N-Fuck you, pig. Todd Hockney? -Who wants to know?\N-New York Police Department. -Shit.\N-Freeze! Hold it! Sure you brought enough guys? <i>It's quite simple:</i> A restaurant that changes with the taste\Nwithout losing the overall aesthetic. In other words... ...the atmosphere will not\Nbe painted on the walls. -Let me give you an example--\N-This I had to see for myself. David. -I'm in a meeting.\N-Time for another one. Everyone, this is David Kujan. Special Agent Kujan. US Customs. These gentlemen\Nare from the New York Police Department. You look good.\NBetter than I would have thought. A small matter of a stolen truck\Nloaded with guns. Mr. Keaton? Will you excuse us for a moment? We have some questions\Nto ask you downtown. You'll be a while. No. Please, sit down. This is a small problem. Enjoy the meal. I'll talk to you later. <i>It didn't make sense that I'd be there.</i> <i>These guys were hard-core hijackers...</i> <i>...but there I was.</i> <i>At that point, I wasn't scared.</i> <i>I knew I hadn't done anything</i>\N<i>they could do me for.</i> <i>Besides, it was fun.</i> <i>I got to make like I was notorious.</i> <i>You all know the drill.</i> <i>When your number is called, step forward</i>\N<i>and repeat the phrase you've been given.</i> <i>Number 1, step forward.</i> "Hand me the keys\Nyou fucking cocksucker." <i>Number 2, step forward.</i> Gimme the fuckin' keys,\Nyou fuckin' cocksucker motherfucker! Knock it off. Get back.\NNumber 3, step forward. -"Hand me the keys, you cocksucker."\N<i>-In English, please.</i> -Excuse me?\N<i>-In English.</i> Hand me the fuckin' keys, you cocksucker.\NWhat the fuck? <i>Number 4, step forward.</i> <i>It was bullshit.</i>\N<i>The whole rap was a setup.</i> "Hand me the keys\Nyou fucking cocksucker." <i>It was the cops' fault.</i> <i>You don't put guys like that</i>\N<i>into a room together.</i> <i>Who knows what can happen?</i> "Hand me the keys\Nyou fucking cocksucker." <i>This has really got to be embarrassing</i>\N<i>for you guys.</i> <i>They drilled us all night.</i> <i>Someone was mad about that truck</i>\N<i>hijacking and the cops had nothing.</i> <i>They were hoping somebody would slip up</i>\N<i>and give them something.</i> <i>They knew we wouldn't fight,</i>\N<i>they knew how to lean on us.</i> <i>They've been doing it forever.</i>\N<i>Our rights went out the window.</i> <i>It was a violation. Disgraceful.</i> <i>They went after McManus first.</i>\N<i>Topnotch entry man.</i> What truck? -The truck with the guns, fucko.\N-"Fucko"? <i>He was a good guy. Crazy, though.</i> Wanna know what your pal\NFenster told us? -Say who?\N-McManus. He told us another story. Is that the one about\Nthe hooker with the dysentery? <i>Fenster always worked with McManus.</i>\N<i>He was a real tight-ass.</i> <i>But when it came to the job,</i>\N<i>he was right on. A smart man.</i> -What are you saying?\N-I said he'll flip you. -He'll what?\N-Flip you. Flip you for real. -I'm shaking. Come on.\N-Okay. -Answer my questions.\N-Can you hear me in the back? Hello? I want my lawyer. I'm gonna have\Nyour fuckin' badge, cocksucker. <i>Todd Hockney: good with explosives.</i> <i>Without a doubt, the one guy</i>\N<i>who didn't give a fuck about anybody.</i> You guys don't have\Na fuckin' leg to stand on. You think so, tough guy? I can put you in Queens\Nduring the hijacking. Really? I live in Queens. Did you put that\Ntogether yourself, Einstein? You got a team of monkeys\Nworking full time on this? You know what happens\Nif you do another turn in the joint? I fuck your father in the shower,\Nand have a snack. -Are you gonna charge me, dickhead?\N-I'll charge you when I'm ready. -With what?\N-You know damn well, dead man. <i>But Keaton?</i> <i>Keaton was the real prize for them</i>\N<i>for obvious reasons.</i> It was your mistake, not mine. Did you ever stop to ask me? I've been walking around\Nwith the same face, the same name. I'm a businessman. What's that? The restaurant business? No. From now on you're in the\N"getting fucked by us" business. I'm gonna make you famous, cocksucker. Like I said... ...it was your mistake... ...not mine. You charge me with this shit... ...and I'll beat it. Okay? Let's get back to the truck, asshole. Really, somebody's got to do something\Nabout this shit. They put me in holding every five minutes.\NSo I did a little time. Does that mean I get railed every time\Na truck finds it's way gone? Fuck 'em. Fenster, will you relax? -These guys don't have any probable cause.\N-You fuckin' right. No PC. You're goddamn right.\NYou do some time, never let you go. They treat me like a criminal. -I'll end up a criminal.\N-You are a criminal. Why'd you got to go and do that? -I'm trying to make a point.\N-Why don't you make your point? You're making me tired all over. Fuck it then. -I heard you were dead.\N-Yeah? -You heard right.\N-Word I got is you hung up your spurs. -What's that all about?\N-What's this? Rumor has it Keaton's gone straight.\NI hear he's tapping Edie Finneran. Who's that? She's a heavyweight criminal\Nlawyer from uptown. I hear she's Keaton's meal ticket. How 'bout it, Keaton? You a lawyer's wife? What kind of retainer you giving her? Do your friend a favor... ...tell him to keep quiet. Dean Keaton... Gone clean? Say it ain't so. -Or was it you that hit that truck?\N-Mac, forget him. Did you get to talk to your lawyer? This whole thing was a shakedown. -What makes you say that?\N-How many times you been in a lineup? It's always you and four dummies. The PD are paying homeless guys\N$10 a head half the time. There's no way they'd line\Nfive felons in the same row. What's a voice lineup?\NPublic defender could get you out of that. -Why the hell was I strip searched?\N-It was the feds. A truckload of guns gets snagged. Customs comes down on NYPD\Nfor answers. They come up with us. -They're clutching at straws.\N-I had a guy's finger up my ass. Is it Friday already? Yeah, lover boy. You want a piece? Jump in. I'll love you. So who in the goddamn piss hell\Nstole our fucking truck? -What did you say?\N-Who stole the fucking truck? -I don't want to know.\N-Who asked you, workingman? Fuck who did it.\NWhat I want to know is, who's the gimp? -He's okay.\N-Says you. How do I know that? What about it, pretzel man?\NWhat's your story? His name is Verbal. Verbal Kint. -Verbal?\N-Yeah. Roger, really. People say I talk too much. I was going to tell you to shut up. -We met before, once or twice.\N-In County. I was in for fraud. You were in a lineup then, too.\NWhat happened? I walked. 90 days, suspended. -So you did it.\N-All right, now look... ...we've all been put out\Nby this whole thing, right? I figure we owe it to ourselves\Nto salvage a little dignity. Now, me and Fenster\Nheard about a little job. Why don't you just calm down? What do you care what he has to say? I'm just talking here. It seems to me like Mr. Hockney\Nwants to hear it... ...and I know Fenster's down. What about you, guy? I'm interested. There. See? I'd like to exercise my right\Nto free assembly. Why don't you just shut up? You're missing the point. No. You're missing the point. I don't want to hear anything from you. I don't care about your job. And... ...I want nothing to do with any of you. I beg your pardon,\Nbut you can all go to hell. Dean Keaton... ...gone the high road. What is the world coming to? Fuck him. <i>And that was how it started:</i> <i>Five of us brought in</i>\N<i>on a trumped-up charge...</i> <i>...to be leaned on by half-wits.</i> I really can't talk about it much here. <i>What the cops never figured out,</i>\N<i>and what I know now...</i> <i>...was that these men would never break,</i>\N<i>never lie down.</i> <i>Never bend over for anybody.</i> <i>Anybody.</i> -Who are you?\N-Agent Jack Baer, FBI. -How many dead?\N-15 so far. They're still pulling bodies\Nout of the water. -Any survivors?\N-Two. One guy's in County hospital,\Nbut he's in a coma. The DA has a second guy,\Na cripple from New York. The chief wants this place sealed off. If you have any questions, give him a call. <i>This is Dave Kujan.</i>\N<i>I'll be in Los Angeles until Tuesday.</i> <i>If you need to reach me, contact Jeff Rabin</i>\N<i>of the San Pedro Police Department...</i> <i>...at extension 112. Have a nice day.</i> <i>-Why can't I see him?</i>\N<i>-I told you...</i> ...the DA came down here\Nlast night ready to arraign... ...even before they moved him to County. Kint's lawyer shows up five minutes later... ...the DA comes out looking like\Nthe bogeyman smacked him around. They take his statement,\Nand they cut him a deal. -Did they charge him with anything?\N-Weapons, misdemeanor 2. What is that? I give the DA credit for getting that much,\Nyou understand? Excuse me, sir. This whole thing has turned political.\NThe mayor was here last night. The chief. This morning,\Nthe governor called, okay? I'm telling you, this guy is protected\Nfrom up on high by the Prince of Darkness. -Take my word for it.\N-When does he post bail? -Maybe two hours, tops.\N-I want to see him. -No.\N-I gotta see him. -No. I can't--\N-You gotta do this for me. I came a long way for this. Dave, please. Even if I let you talk to him,\Nhe won't talk to you. He's paranoid about being recorded. -He knows the rooms are wired.\N-I quit. This won't be an interrogation,\Njust a friendly chat. -He won't go into the interrogation room.\N-Then someplace else. Where? No, no. If this was a dope deal, where's the dope?\NIf it was a hit, who called it? I'm sure you have a host of wild theories\Nto answer all these questions. -You know what I think.\N-That's crazy, and it doesn't even matter. The guy's got total immunity.\NHis story checks out. -He doesn't know what you want to know.\N-I don't think he does, not exactly. But there's a lot more to his story,\Nbelieve me. I wanna know why\N27 men died on that pier... ...for what looks to be $91 million\Nworth of dope that wasn't there. And above all,\NI want to be sure Dean Keaton's dead. He's dead. Come on. Two hours.\NJust till he makes bail. They're all dead. I don't care how tough\Nyou say Keaton was... ...nobody on that boat\Ncould've come out alive. -Is he talking?\N-He regained consciousness an hour ago. He spoke, not English, then he lapsed. -Hungarian?\N-That might have been it. -Most of them were Hungarians.\N-You gotta put this on. Burn victims are very susceptible\Nto infection. And, of course, there's no smoking. Keep your mask up.\NPlease don't touch him. Is he gonna die? He's burned 60 percent of his body,\Nbroken ribs-- Call security. Put a man on the door. -Is he dangerous?\N-Yes. Do it. Do it now. Joel? Baer. Down at LA County. Look, the guy they pulled out of the harbor\Nis Arkosh Kovash. Yes, I'm sure. No, he's all fucked up. I can't hear you. Will you shut up? I'm on the phone. Yes. No, not till I put a man on him. Send me someone\Nwho can speak Hungarian. He's awake.\NHe's talking like a Thai hooker. Keyser Soze. -What?\N-Keyser Soze! No shit? Call Dan Metzheiser over at Justice... ...and find Dave Kujan from Customs. Verbal, this is Agent Kujan from Customs. Nice to meet you. He wants to ask you a few questions\Nbefore you go. -What about?\N-About a Dean Keaton, mostly. I'd like to start at the lineup\Nback in New York. -Can I get some coffee?\N-In a while. Let's talk about the lineup. I'm really thirsty.\NI used to dehydrate as a kid. Once I got so bad\Nmy piss come out like snot. -It was all thick and gooey--\N-I'll get your fucking coffee. Get me one, too, while you're at it. That guy is tense. Tension is a killer. I used to be in a barbershop quartet\Nin Skokie, lllinois. The baritone was this guy\Nnamed Kip Diskin, big fat guy. Like, orca fat.\NHe was so stressed in the morning-- -You know we're trying to help you.\N-Sure, and I appreciate that. And I wanna help you, Agent Kujan.\NI like cops. I would've liked to have been a fed,\Nbut my CP-- You're not tellin' us everything.\NI know you know something. <i>I told the DA everything I know.</i> <i>I know you like Keaton.</i> <i>-I know you think he's a good man.</i>\N<i>-I know he was good.</i> <i>He was a corrupt cop.</i> <i>Sure. 15 years ago,</i>\N<i>but he was a good thief.</i> The cops wouldn't let him go legit. Dean Keaton was a piece of shit. Are you trying to get a rise out of me? -I just wanna hear your story.\N-It's all there. May I have a cigarette? -According to your statement--\N-I need a light. According to your statement,\Nyou're a short-con operator... ...run-of-the-mill-- According to your statement,\Nyou're a short-con operator... ...run-of-the-mill scams. It's been suppressed.\NAnything in there is inadmissible. I know. Sweet deal you have here.\NTotal immunity. I do have the weapons charge.\NI'm lookin' at six whole months hard time. You know a dealer named Ruby Deemer? You know a religious guy\Nnamed John Paul? -You know Ruby's in Attica?\N-He didn't have my lawyer. I know Ruby. He's big on respect. He's a good friend of mine,\Nlikes me very much. I know your testimony is sealed.\NRuby's well connected. He's got lots of friends inside\Nwho do favors for him. What would he say if he found out\Nyou dropped his name to the DA? -There's nothing there on Ruby.\N-I'll be sure to mention that to him. Know what I've learned on the job?\NHow to spot a murderer. Say you arrest three guys\Nfor the same killing. Put them in jail overnight. Next morning,\Nwhoever's sleeping is your man. If you're guilty, you know you're caught.\NYou let your guard down. -You follow me?\N-No. Let me get to the point. I'm smarter than you,\Nand I'm gonna find out what I wanna know. I'll get it, whether you like it or not. I'm not a rat. Thanks. When I was pickin' beans in Guatemala\Nwe used to make fresh coffee. Right off the trees, I mean. That was good. -This is shit, but I'm in a police station.\N-Can we get started again? What happened after the lineup? The desk sergeant was telling me\Nhe couldn't release you. Can you believe that?\NYou weren't even charged. Damn police. I wanna have pictures taken of your face. -I'll take them to the DA tomorrow.\N-Forget about it. I'll have this thing in front\Nof a grand jury by Monday. I don't want to talk about it, okay? What did Fortier and Renault say? They asked for more time\Nto think about investing. Damn it. More time for what? No matter how you cover my tracks\Nthey're still gonna find out about me. Give me some credit. I got you this far.\NLet's go to the grand jury. -This isn't gonna stop if we don't--\N-It's never going to stop, period. By next week, every investor in the city\Nis gonna be walking away from us. It's finished. I'm finished. Don't give up on me now. It's never gonna stop. I love you. They ruined me in there tonight. I love you. Do you hear me? What? All right. Let's just go to my place. We'll worry about this tomorrow. Let's go. <i>Fenster and McManus</i>\N<i>had a cagey proposition:</i> <i>A fast-jump, high-risk, long money.</i> <i>We all knew it could be done.</i> <i>The way I figured,</i>\N<i>to do it wrong meant killing.</i> <i>To do it right took five men.</i> <i>Five men meant Keaton.</i> <i>Keaton took convincing.</i> New York's finest taxi service. Bullshit. Bullshit. They don't operate anymore. McManus has a friend in the 14th precinct.\NThey're coming out for one job, Thursday. They're pickin' up a guy\Nsmuggling emeralds from South America. McManus already has a fence set up. -A fence? Who?\N-Some guy in California called Redfoot. -I never heard of him.\N-You have to come. -What's it to you whether I do it or not?\N-They don't know me. You do. They won't take me unless you go. Look at me. I need this. You're telling me you don't need this?\NIs this your place? I'm not knocking you. You got\Na good scam going with this lawyer. Sorry. It's okay. You say it's the real thing? That's cool. You okay? I was out of line. But they're never gonna stop with us.\NYou know that. As clean as you get,\Nthey'll never let you go now. This way, we hit the cops where it hurts,\Nand we get well in the meantime. You sure you're okay? I'll be all right. Look, I... -...sometimes get--\N-Forget it. I'll probably shit blood tonight. So... ...how do they wanna do it? McManus wants to go in shooting.\NI say no. Fenster? Hockney? They're pretty pissed off.\NThey'll do anything. I got a way to do it without killing anyone. But like I say,\Nthey won't let me in without you. $3 million? Maybe more. No killing. Not if we do it my way. <i>New York's finest taxi service</i>\N<i>was not your normal taxi service.</i> <i>It was a ring of corrupt cops in the NYPD</i>\N<i>that ran a high-profit racket...</i> <i>...driving smugglers and drug dealers</i>\N<i>all over the city.</i> <i>For $300 a mile,</i>\N<i>you got your own blue and white...</i> <i>...and a police escort.</i>\N<i>They even had their own business cards.</i> <i>After a while, somebody started asking</i>\N<i>questions, and the taxi service shut down.</i> <i>Ever since then, Internal Affairs</i>\N<i>has been waiting to catch them in the act.</i> <i>That's where we came in.</i> -So, how was the flight?\N-Fuckin' great. Will this get me to Staten Island? Are you kiddin' me?\NThis will get you to Cape Cod. <i>McManus came to us with the job.</i>\N<i>Fenster got the vans.</i> <i>Hockney supplied the hardware.</i> <i>I came through with</i>\N<i>how to do it so no one got killed.</i> <i>But Keaton?</i>\N<i>Keaton put on the finishing touch.</i> <i>A little "fuck you" from the five</i>\N<i>of us to the NYPD.</i> Watch this. Careful. Come on, asshole! Holy shit! -Don't move, you fucker!\N-Drop it now, motherfucker! Drop the fuckin' gun! Drop it! Don't fuckin' touch a fuckin' thing. -What do you guys want?\N-Put your fuckin' thing away. We're cops! Stupid assholes! -Watch the glass!\N-Don't fuckin' move, motherfucker! -You want a buckshot shampoo, chubby?\N-Shut up! Fuck. 'Afternoon, my little pork chops.\NGive me the shit. -Don't move!\N-Give him the shit! Give him the fuckin' thing! Give him the fuckin' shit, man! Hurry up! Come on! -Now the money!\N-There's no money. -Give me the money now!\N-There's no fuckin' money. Give him the fuckin' money! -Do it! Give him the money!\N-Give me the money! -Give him the money!\N-Hurry up! You know who the fuck I am? You people know\Nwho the fuck I am? Fuck! We do now, jerk-off. Cocksucker. Wait a minute. What's that? What the fuck? Holy shit! Go! <i>Keaton made an anonymous phone call.</i> <i>The press was on the scene</i>\N<i>before the police were.</i> <i>Strausz and Rizzi</i>\N<i>were indicted three days later.</i> <i>Within a few weeks,</i>\N<i>50 more cops went down with them.</i> <i>Everybody got it right in the ass,</i>\N<i>from the chief on down.</i> <i>It was beautiful.</i> I owe you $2.50. Dr. Keaton. -There's more here than I thought.\N-When's the fence coming? Redfoot never comes to see me.\NI always go to see him. In California? Yes, Verbal, in California. Fenster and I-- Wait, hold the fuckin' phone.\NYou and Fenster? No. -You fuckin' kiddin' me?\N-So then, who's gonna go? We all go. What's your fuckin' problem, man? My problem, is you and Fenster\Nhoneymooning in California... ...while the rest of us are sittin' here\Nholding our dicks. The job's over. Cool it. LA's a good place to lay low for a while. You wanna dance? Ladies. I would like to propose a toast. There you go. To Mr. Verbal... ...the man with the plan. <i>We're gonna miss the flight.</i> Don't do this.\NSend her a note. Something. I said we'll make it. We're gonna miss the plane. She'll understand. That's heartwarming. Really. I'm weepy. You wanna wait outside? You guys wanted to know what happened.\NI'm telling you. Come on, Verbal. Who do you think you're talkin' to?\NYou expect me to believe that he retired? For a woman? Bullshit. Keaton was using her. -He loved her.\N-Sure. <i>I'm supposed to believe that hitting</i>\N<i>the taxi service wasn't his idea.</i> <i>-It was all Fenster and McManus.</i>\N<i>-Keaton was a cop for four years.</i> <i>Who else would know better?</i> <i>-That job had his name on it.</i>\N<i>-Edie had him turned around.</i> Let me tell you something. I know Dean Keaton. I've been investigating him\Nfor the past three years. The guy I know\Nwas a cold-blooded bastard. IAD indicted him on three counts of\Nmurder before he was kicked off the force. Don't sell me the hooker\Nwith a heart of gold. You got him all wrong. Do I? Dean Keaton was under indictment\Nseven times while he was on the force. In every case,\Nwitnesses either reversed their testimony... ...or died before they could testify. When they finally did nail him for fraud,\Nhe spent five years in Sing Sing. He killed three prisoners inside. Of course, I can't prove this... ...but I can't prove the best part either. Dean Keaton was dead. Did you know that? He died in a fire two years ago,\Nduring an investigation into the murder... ...of a witness who was going\Nto testify against him. Two people saw Dean Keaton\Nwalk into a warehouse he owned... ...just before it blew up. They said he went in\Nto check a leaking gas main. It blew up and took all\Nof Dean Keaton with it. Within three months of the explosion,\Nthe two witnesses, they were dead. One killed himself in his car. The other fell down an open elevator shaft. Let's get this show on the road. This is not what we discussed.\NThere are too many-- I promise we'll be out\Nbefore he blows his porch light. -I have a noon meeting.\N-Five minutes. Everyone calm down, all right? I want you to ask this man\Nabout the shootout in the harbor. -He says they were buying--\N-Dope. We know. He doesn't know\Nwhat they were buying, but not dope. -People.\N-What? He needs guarantees... -What is he talking about, guarantees?\N-He says his life is in danger. He saw the Devil. Looked him in the eye. -I'm on my way.\N-No, wait a minute. Ask him to tell him what he told me... ...about the Devil. Who's the Devil? Keyser Soze. Keyser Soze? He was in the harbor, killing many men. He saw Keyser Soze? -He saw his face.\N-All right. Tell him to tell her what he looks like. Describe him. <i>Six weeks ago,</i>\N<i>I get an anonymous phone call...</i> <i>...telling me I can find Keaton</i>\N<i>eating at Mondino's, and there he is.</i> Because he never profited\Nfrom his alleged death... ...and we convicted someone else\Nof the murder we tried to pin on him... ...we had to let him go. He was dead just long enough\Nfor the murder rap to blow over. And then he had lunch. I don't know about that. I don't think you do,\Nbut you say you saw Keaton die. I think you're covering his ass,\Nand he's still out there. I think he's behind\Nthat circus at the harbor. My bet is he's using you because\Nyou're stupid and think he's your friend. You tell me he's dead, so be it. I wanna be sure\Nbefore I go back to New York. He wasn't behind anything.\NIt was the lawyer. What lawyer? What lawyer? Back when I was in\Nthat barbershop quartet-- You don't think I know you held out\Non the DA? What did you leave out? I could be on the phone\Nto Ruby in 10 minutes. -The DA gave me immunity.\N-Not from me. You get no immunity from me,\Nyou piece of shit. Every criminal I have put in prison,\Nevery cop that owes me a favor... ...every creep and scumbag\Nthat walks the street... ...will know the name of Verbal Kint.\NYou talk to me... ...or that precious immunity\Nthey grant you... ...won't be worth the paper the contract\Nput out on your life is printed on. There was a lawyer. Kobayashi. -Is he the one that killed Keaton?\N-No, but I'm sure Keaton is dead. Convince me. Tell me every last detail. <i>We arrived in Los Angeles</i>\N<i>and met McManus' fence, Redfoot.</i> <i>He had a good reputation.</i>\N<i>Seemed like a good guy.</i> <i>-Still, we should have known better.</i>\N-How you doing? -Good. You?\N-Not bad. Can't complain. How's it going, Fenster? Don't need to open it, right? You must be Keaton. Redfoot, Dean Keaton. -Todd Hockney and Verbal Kint.\N-Verbal, the man with the plan. You interested in more work? -We're always looking for extra work.\N-We're on vacation. That's too bad. I got a ton of work and no good people. -Not like you guys.\N-What's the job? There's this jeweler\Nout of Texas named Saul. He rents a suite in some downtown hotel. He does free appraisals.\NSometimes he buys, sometimes he doesn't. The word is,\Nhe carries around a lot of cash. So I figure, I keep the merchandise,\Nyou keep the green. -Simple.\N-What about security? A couple of bodyguards.\NNothing you couldn't handle. Give me time to check it out? I expect nothing less from you, man. Good to see you. We'll call you. Enjoy LA. Get yourself laid. A friend in New York tells me\Nthat you knew Spook Hollis. The way I hear it,\Nyou did time with ol' Spook. A good man, wasn't he? I used to run dope for him. Too bad he got shivved. I shivved him. Better you hear it from me now\Nthan from somebody else later. I appreciate that. But just out of curiosity... ...was it business or personal? A bit of both. Like I said... ...you give me a call if you're interested. Is there a problem? One job. That was the deal. One job? One job? That's a good one. <i>Keaton fought it as best he could,</i>\N<i>but a man can't change what he is.</i> <i>He can convince anyone he's someone else,</i>\N<i>but never himself.</i> <i>It took one day with McManus nagging,</i>\N<i>and we went back to work.</i> I get out of my car,\Nand the thing is wrecked. I look in the backseat of the other car,\Nand this woman's totally naked. -I'm laughin' so hard I can't breathe.\N-Get in the car, Saul. -Freeze, motherfucker!\N-Stay right there! There's a second one here, somewhere. Gimme the case. Give me the fuckin' case! Give me the fuckin' case.\NI'm tellin' you for the last time. Give me the fuckin' case! -Come on!\N-Don't move! Hand over the case. Hand over the fuckin' case. Come on, let's go! -Come on!\N-Bad day. Fuck it. Let's go! Fuck. -Looks like a lot of china to me.\N-Shit. Guys, come on. -What are you doin'?\N-I'm gonna kill him. We did it your way, now we'll do it mine. -You gonna kill him?\N-I'll deal with him. -You'd better, or I'm gonna.\N-Shut up. What am I supposed to do with that? Feed it to the gimp. Ease his pain.\NI don't know what that is. -What do you mean?\N-I don't know. I got thrown this job by some lawyer. Who? I don't know. Some limey. He's a middleman for somebody.\NHe doesn't say, I don't ask. -You're fuckin' full of shit!\N-Fuck you. -Fuck you.\N-Listen to me. We wanna meet him, okay? That's funny. He called me last night.\NHe says he wants to meet you guys. Okay, we'll meet him. -I'll call you.\N-Good. Let's go. I don't like it. Wait a minute.\NOne more thing, tough guy: Any more surprises, and I'm gonna kill you. You're such a tough guy.\NBut do me a favor, all right? Get the fuck off my dick. No! Put a leash on that puppy. It's an awful shame\Nabout Saul gettin' whacked. Cops'll be lookin' for the guys who did it. Sooner or later,\Nthey're gonna come around askin' me. You have a sweet night, ladies. Fuck you. -So this lawyer--\N-Kobayashi. -Came from Redfoot.\N-Right. And why leave this out\Nwhen you talked to the DA? Dave, someone to see you. I've been looking all over for you. You still after that coke that took a walk\Nout of that bloodbath yesterday? You can stop looking. There was no coke. I've been in LA County talking to a guy\Nthey pulled out of a drainpipe... ...yesterday after the shootout. He came to this morning,\Nhe started talking. He's part of a Hungarian mob.\NThey dealt with gwats from Argentina. He says it was definitely not a dope deal. -But there were--\N-We know. But he says no on the dope. This Hungarian tells me they were\Npulling stumps for Turkey the next day. They had no time for that kind of product,\Nand no means to move it. -What's the money for?\N-He didn't know. No one doing the deal knew\Nexcept for a few key people. They were all very hush about it, he says. -Whatever it was, it was very sensitive.\N-I don't get it. You got the cripple in there\Nfrom New York? Did he mention Keyser Soze? Who? Just bear with me here. -Who's Keyser Soze?\N-Fuck! We've been goin' over this\Nfor an hour and a half. What we need to do is find Redfoot\Nand get the hell out of here now. What we need to do is think. Think back. Somebody with power... ...somebody capable of tracking us\Nfrom New York to LA. -What the hell are we doing here?\N-We're waiting. -Sit down.\N-No. I'm hot, and I'm fuckin' bored. Mr. Hockney, do stay. Mr. Keaton. Mr. Fenster I recognize\Nfrom his mug shots... ...as well as Mr. McManus. I can only assume that you are Mr. Kint,\Nthe gentleman who disposed of Saul Berg. My employer sends his gratitude,\Na most unexpected benefit. I am Mr. Kobayashi. I have been asked by my employer\Nto bring a proposal to you gentlemen. -What do you want?\N-My employer requires your services. One job, one day's work. Very dangerous. He does not expect all of you to live.\NBut those of you who do... ...will have $91 million to divide\Nbetween you in any way you see fit. Who's your boss? I work for Keyser Soze. Who's Keyser Soze? Judging by the sudden change in mood... ...I feel sure the rest\Nof your associates can tell you. I come with an offer\Ndirectly from Mr. Soze. -An order, actually.\N-What do you mean, "an order"? In 1981, you participated in the hijacking\Nof a truck in Buffalo, New York. The cargo was raw steel,\Nsteel which belonged to Mr. Soze... ...and which was destined for Pakistan\Nto be used in a nuclear reactor. A most profitable violation\Nof UN Regulations. You had no way of knowing this... ...because the fellow shipping the steel\Nwas working for Soze... ...without his knowledge. Earlier this year,\NMr. Fenster and Mr. McManus... ...hijacked a two-prop cargo flight\Nout of Newark airport. The plane was carrying gold and platinum\Nwiring also set for Pakistan. Two months ago,\NMr. Hockney stole a truck... ...carrying gun parts through Queens. Gun parts which were set to be destroyed\Nby the state of New York. They were to be lost in a way station\Nand rerouted to Belfast. Again, Mr. Soze using pawns\Nwho had no knowledge. Which brings us to Mr. Kint. Nine months ago, one of Mr. Soze's... ...less than intelligent couriers was taken\Nin a complicated confidence scam... ...by a cripple. He was relieved of $62,000. Now, it has taken us\Nsome time to find you. Our intention was to approach you\Nafter your apprehension in New York. You set up the lineup. Yes. You were not to be released\Nuntil I had come to see you. It seems Mr. Keaton's attorney,\NMiss Finneran... ...was a little too effective\Nin expediting his release. Holding the rest of you\Nbecame a moot point. -What about Redfoot?\N-Mr. Redfoot knew nothing. Mr. Soze rarely works\Nwith the same people for long... ...and they never know\Nwho they're working for. One cannot be betrayed\Nif one has no people. So, why are you telling us? Because you have stolen from Mr. Soze,\NMr. Fenster. All of you. That you did not know it\Nis the only reason you're still alive. He feels you owe him.\NYou will repay your debt. Fuck the debt, and fuck you.\NHow do we know you work for Soze? I don't think that is very relevant. All five of you are responsible\Nfor the murder of Saul Berg... ...and his bodyguards. Mr. Redfoot can testify\Nto your involvement. We can see to it that he will. -What's your point?\N-The offer is this, gentlemen: Mr. Soze's primary interest... ...is narcotics. He has been competing, shall we say... ...with a group of Argentineans\Nfor several years. Competing with Mr. Soze has taken its toll. These Argentineans\Nare negotiating the sale... ...of $91 million in cocaine\Nin three days time. Needless to say,\Nthis purchase will revitalize... ...the diminishing strength\Nof their organization. Mr. Soze would like you to stop the deal. If you choose,\Nyou may wait until after the buy. Whatever money changes hands is yours. Mr. Soze would like you to get to the boat\Nand destroy the cocaine onboard. And then you will be free\Nof your obligations to Mr. Soze. Give me one good reason\Nwhy I shouldn't kill you right now. A gift from Mr. Soze. Good day, gentlemen. They got my whole life in here,\Neverything I've done since I was 18. They fuckin' know everything. Everybody I've ever worked with\Nor did time with. No. -This isn't right.\N-I don't know. Who's that guy who used\Nto talk about Soze in New York? -Bricks Marlin.\N-He did jobs for him, indirect stuff. He said he always made five times\Nmore money on it than the job was worth. This guy's a pipe dream. Kobayashi's using him\Nfor window dressing. I don't know. This is bad. It's bullshit. This guy could be LAPD.\NIt's a fuckin' setup. The way I hear it,\NSoze's some kind of butcher. -A peerless, psycho, fucked-up butcher.\N-There is no Keyser Soze! Who is Keyser Soze? He's supposed to be Turkish.\NSome say his father was German. Nobody ever believed he was real. Nobody knew him or saw anybody\Nthat ever worked directly for him. To hear Kobayashi tell it,\Nanybody could have worked for Soze. You never knew. That was his power. The greatest trick the Devil ever pulled... ...was convincing the world he didn't exist. One story the guys told me,\Nthe story I believe... ...was from his days in Turkey. There was a gang of Hungarians\Nthat wanted their own mob. They realized that to be in power,\Nyou didn't need guns... ...or money or even numbers. You just needed the will\Nto do what the other guy wouldn't. After a while they come into power,\Nand then they come after Soze. He was small-time then.\NJust running dope, they say. They come to his home... <i>...in the afternoon looking for his business.</i> <i>They find his wife and kids in the house,</i>\N<i>and decide to wait for Soze.</i> <i>He comes home to find his wife raped</i>\N<i>and children screaming.</i> <i>The Hungarians knew Soze was tough,</i>\N<i>not to be trifled with.</i> They let him know they meant business. <i>No!</i> <i>They tell him they want his territory,</i>\N<i>all his business.</i> Soze looks over the faces of his family. Then he showed these men\Nof will what will really was. <i>He tells them he would</i>\N<i>rather see his family dead...</i> <i>...than live another day after this.</i> <i>He lets the last Hungarian go...</i> ...waits until his family is in the ground,\Nand goes after the rest of the mob. He kills their kids, he kills their wives... ...he kills their parents and their friends. <i>He burns down the houses they live in...</i> <i>...and the stores they work in.</i> <i>He kills people that owe them money.</i>\N<i>And like that...</i> ...he's gone, underground. Nobody's ever seen him since.\NHe becomes a myth. A spook story that criminals\Ntell their kids at night. "Rat on your pop,\Nand Keyser Soze will get you." No one ever really believes. Do you believe in him? Keaton always said: "I don't believe in God,\Nbut I'm afraid of him." I believe in God. And the only thing that scares me\Nis Keyser Soze. You give any weight to this? I can introduce you to Dan Metzheiser\Nfrom Justice. He's got a file on Soze in DC.\NIt's been a hobby of his for a while. A lot of guys equate him to that reporter\Non <i>The Incredible Hulk.</i> You've heard of him? Where? On the street? A few times. You know, outside stuff. Someone working for a guy who worked\Nfor a guy who got money from Soze. Shit like that. It could be an old badge. A hex sign. Keep people from fucking with you\Nwhen a name meant something. -But you're here.\N-Shit, yeah. This guy's trying to walk out of a hospital\Nbecause he's so afraid of Soze. I'll run it up the flagpole. I came clean. I told it like it happened. So what about how I got there? It's so full of holes, the DA would've\Ntold me to forget amnesty. You got what you wanted out of me.\NBig deal. -That's why you never told the DA?\N-You tell me. If I told you the Loch Ness monster\Nhired me, what would you say? Turn state's evidence.\NWe'll put you on the stand. I've got immunity.\NWhat can you possibly offer me? If there really is a Keyser Soze,\Nhe's gonna come lookin' for you. Where's your head? Where do you think the pressure is? Keyser Soze, or whatever you call him,\Nknows where I am right now. He has the burner on your ass to let me go\Nso he can scoop me up 10 minutes later. Immunity was just a deal\Nwith you assholes. I got a new problem when I post bail. Why play into his hands?\NWe can protect you. Thanks, Dave. Bang-up job so far.\NExtortion, coercion. Pardon me if I ask you to kiss my pucker. The same fuckers that rounded us up\Nare now bailing me out? Fuck you. You think you can catch Keyser Soze? You think a guy like that\Ncomes this close to getting caught... ...and sticks his head out? If he comes up for anything,\Nit'll be to get rid of me. After that... ...my guess is you'll never hear\Nfrom him again. What happened next? We woke up the next morning\Nand Fenster was gone. He couldn't handle the idea\Nof slumming for Soze. He left us a note wishing us good luck... ...and took a chunk of the money\Nwe'd scraped together. Then what? McManus was furious. He talked about tracking him down\Nand ripping his heart out. All sorts of shit. That night, we got the call. What call? Kobayashi told us where\Nwe could find Fenster. Let's get the fuck out of here. We gotta bury him. With what? With our hands. This is nuts. It's dry fucking sand. When he rots the surfers\Nare gonna smell him a mile away. -Dig, you fuck.\N-What are we gonna do? This fuckin' guy is gonna kill us. I don't know about you, peg leg,\Nbut I can run. I got no problem with that. Kobayashi doesn't seem\Nto have a problem with it either. You run, and we're gonna be\Ndiggin' a hole for you. You got that? This ain't my boy we're burying.\NI don't owe anybody! -So fuck you.\N-He was my partner for five years. We did more jobs and I saw more money\Nthan you can ever count. So fuck you! -'Cause now it's payback!\N-It's not payback! It's precaution. You want payback? You wanna run?\NI don't care. I'm not doin' this for Fenster. I'm not doin' it for you. I'm doin' this for me. I'm gonna finish this thing. This Kobayashi bastard\Nis not gonna stand on me. After they killed Fenster,\Nnobody would run? -I wanted to. I thought we could make it.\N-Why didn't you say anything? Believe me, I tried,\Nbut Keaton wouldn't have it. It was too far-fetched for him. Keaton was a grounded guy. An ex-cop. To a cop, the explanation\Nis never that complicated. It's always simple. There's no mystery to the street,\Nno arch-criminal. You got a body and think\Nhis brother did it, you're probably right. Nobody argued with Keaton. They just set their minds\Nto whacking Kobayashi. They're coming up. <i>-Did you hear me? He's coming up.</i>\N-He's on his way down. Don't move. Press 20. Do it now. Move. -The answer is "no."\N-Mr. Soze will be most-- Listen, cocksucker,\Nthere is no Keyser Soze. Mention his name again,\NI'll kill you right now. A strange threat. I assume\Nyou've come here to kill me anyway. We know that you can get to us... ...but now you know\Nthat we can get to you. I'm giving you one last\Nchance to call this off. My employer has made up his mind. -He does not change it.\N-Neither do we. You got Fenster,\Nbut you won't be able to get all of us. Not before one of us gets through to you. I believe you. I most sincerely do. You would not have been chosen\Nwere you not so suitable. But I cannot make this decision.\NWhatever you threaten me with is... ...ludicrous in comparison\Nto what will be done to me... ...if I do not carry out my orders in full. I'm the guy that's gonna get you. I just wanted you to know that. I'm so sorry. I implore you, believe me... ...Mr. Soze is very real... -...and very determined.\N-We'll see. Before you do me in... ...you will let me finish my business\Nwith Miss Finneran first, won't you? What did you say? Edie Finneran. She's upstairs in my office... ...for an extradition deposition. I requested she be\Nput on the case personally. She flew in yesterday. No matter. Kill away. You're lying. Am I? Miss Finneran's escort\Nwhile she's here in Los Angeles. Never leaves her for a moment. I thought you'd be glad to know\Nshe's in good hands. Get some rest.\NThe boat will be ready for you on Friday. If I see you or any\Nof your friends before then... ...Miss Finneran will be the victim of\Na most gruesome violation before she dies. As indeed will your father, Mr. Hockney... ...and your Uncle Randall in Arizona,\NMr. Kint. I might only castrate\NMr. McManus' nephew, David. Do I make myself clear? We will take care\Nof the two bodies downstairs. We'll add them to the cost of Mr. Fenster. If you'll excuse me, gentlemen. It's a logistical nightmare. Close quarters. 10, maybe 20 men. There's no tellin'\Nhow many more are gonna be below deck. Can we stealth these guys? With all that coke, they're gonna be ready. Which brings me to sunny point Number 2. Even if one of us gets through\Nand jacks the boat, we still got nothin'. What if we wait for the money? Ten more men at least. In my opinion, it can't be done. Anyone who goes in\Nis not comin' out alive. -I'm gonna wait for the money.\N-Me, too. -Did you hear what he just said?\N-If I'm goin' in, I want a cut. Me, too. There's nothing that can't be done. I just can't believe\Nwe're gonna walk in to certain death. The news said it's raining in New York. What language is that? I don't know. Russian, I think. Hungarian? The package has arrived, gentlemen. You kids ready? I would be if I didn't have to stop\Nand answer you. I'm ready. McManus, you better be set up\Nin 10 seconds. I'm ready. I want you to stay here. I'm supposed to cover-- If we don't get out of this,\Ntake the money and go. I can't-- Find Edie.\NTell her everything that happened. She knows people. She knows what to do. If I don't get Kobayashi my way,\Nshe'll get him her way. -What if I--\N-Just do what I say. Please. Tell her that... Tell her I tried. <i>McManus, he's on his way.</i> I'm there. One, two, three, four... ...five, six, seven... Oswald was a fag. Hi. How you doin'? Is there a problem? Now. <i>"Old McDonald had a farm</i> <i>"Ee-aye, ee-aye, O</i> "And on that farm, he shot some guys" Elvis has left the building. Hold fire. Hold fire. <i>Vamonos!</i> Hello. <i>Why didn't you run?</i> I froze up. I thought about Fenster\Nand how he looked when we buried him. Then I thought about Keaton,\Nand it looked like he might pull it off. A boy found a body on the beach today. Thrown clear of the boat.\NShot twice in the head. Two guys from the Bureau identified him. -What else?\N-His name was Arturo Márquez. A petty smuggler from Argentina. He was arrested last year in New York\Nfor trafficking. He escapes to California.\NThey pick him up in Long Beach. They're setting up extradition,\Nhe escapes again. Now, get this. Edie Finneran's brought in\Nto advise on the proceedings. Kobayashi. New York faxed me a copy\Nof his testimony. -He was a rat.\N-A big fucking rat. Arturo was very opposed\Nto returning to prison. So much so,\Nthat he named close to 50 people. Guess who he named in the finale. Keyser Soze. There's more. I'll tell you what I know.\NStop me when this sounds familiar. There was no dope on that boat. You, stay quiet. He's here. I know he's here. That's him.\NI'm telling you, that's him. I know he's here! -You can't understand. That's him.\N-Shut up. That's him. You hear me?\NI'm telling you, it's Keyser Soze! -Where's Hockney?\N-I don't know. There's no coke. -What?\N-You heard me, dumb fuck. -There's no coke!\N-What the fuck? No coke? I've been up and down\Nin every fucking room. -There's gotta be coke!\N-There is nothing! Nothing! Don't you fuck with me. There is no fucking coke! I'm out of here. I told them nothing. I swear. I told them nothing. Please. What the fuck is goin' on? The strangest thing. That's what you said.\NYou saw a man in a suit with a slim build. Wait a minute. Are you saying you saw Keyser Soze? -You said you didn't know who it was.\N-I know there was dope on that boat. -Stop stallin'.\N-I'm not. -You know what I'm getting at.\N-Get out of my face. I got immunity. I don't have to take this. You know what I'm getting at. -I don't know what you're talking about.\N-The truth! Try to tell me\Nyou saw someone kill Keaton. I did. You're lying to me. -You've known this whole time.\N-I don't know what you're saying. I did see Keaton get shot. I swear to you. Why didn't you help him? You had a gun. He was your friend. Because I was afraid. -Afraid.\N-Afraid of what? -Afraid of--\N-I knew it was Keyser Soze. It was Keyser Soze, I mean,\Nthe Devil himself. How do you shoot the Devil in the back? What if you miss? Let's get back to the pier. -Arturo Márquez. Ever hear of him?\N-What? No. <i>He was a stool pigeon</i>\N<i>for the Justice Department.</i> He swore out a statement\Nto federal marshals... ...saying that he had seen\Nand could positively identify one... <i>...Keyser Soze.</i> It says right here in the report. He had intimate knowledge\Nof his businesses, including... ...but not exclusive to,\Ndrug trafficking and murder. I never heard of him. His own people were selling him\Nto a gang of Hungarians. <i>Most likely the same Hungarians</i>\N<i>that Soze all but wiped out back in Turkey.</i> The money wasn't there for dope. The Hungarians were going\Nto buy the one guy... <i>...that could incriminate Keyser Soze.</i> -I said I never heard of him.\N-But Keaton did. <i>Edie Finneran was Márquez's</i>\N<i>extradition advisor.</i> <i>She knew who he was and what he knew.</i> There were no drugs on that boat.\NIt was a hit. A suicide mission\Nto whack out the one guy... <i>...that could finger Keyser Soze.</i> <i>So Soze put some thieves to it...</i> <i>...men he knew he could march</i>\N<i>into certain death.</i> You're saying Soze\Nsent us to kill someone? <i>I'm saying Keaton did.</i>\N<i>He left you behind for a reason.</i> Just do what I tell you. If you all knew that Soze\Ncould find you anywhere... ...why did he give you the money to run? -He could have used you on the boat.\N-He wanted me to live. <i>A one-time dirty cop without</i>\N<i>a loyalty in the world...</i> <i>...finds it in his heart</i>\N<i>to save a worthless rat cripple?</i> No, sir. Why? Edie. <i>I don't buy that reform story for a minute.</i> Even if I did... ...I certainly don't believe\Nhe would send you to protect her. So why? Because he was my friend. No, he wasn't your friend.\NKeaton didn't have friends. What are you doing here? He saved you\Nbecause he wanted it that way. It was his will. -Keaton was Keyser Soze.\N-No. <i>A man who could wrangle the wills</i>\N<i>of men like Hockney and McManus.</i> <i>A man who could engineer a police lineup...</i> <i>...through all his years of contacts in NYPD.</i> The kind of man\Nwho could've killed Edie Finneran. She was found yesterday\Nat a hotel in Pennsylvania... ...shot twice in the head. What do you think about Keaton now? Edie? He used all of you to get him on that boat. <i>He couldn't get on alone.</i>\N<i>He had to pull the trigger himself...</i> ...to make sure he got his man... ...the one man that could identify him. This is all bullshit. You said you saw him die. <i>Or did you?</i> You had to hide\Nwhen you heard the police cars. <i>You said you heard the shot</i>\N<i>before the fire...</i> ...but you didn't see him die. -I knew him. He would never--\N-He programmed you. <i>He programmed you to tell us</i>\N<i>what he wanted you to.</i> <i>He knew we were close.</i>\N<i>You said it yourself.</i> <i>Where was the political pressure</i>\N<i>to protect you from?</i> It was Keaton. -Immunity was your reward.\N-But why me? Why not Fenster or McManus or Hockney? Why me? I'm stupid.\NI'm a cripple. Why me? Because you're a cripple. Because you're stupid. Because you're weaker than them. If he's dead... If what you say is true,\Nthen it won't matter. It was his idea to hit the taxi service,\Nwasn't it? -Come on, tell me the truth.\N-It was all Keaton. We followed him from the beginning. I didn't know. I saw him die. I believe he's dead. Christ. You're not safe on your own. You think he's... Keyser Soze? I don't know. Keyser Soze's a shield,\Nor like you said, a spook story. But I know Keaton, and someone\Nis out there pulling strings for you. -Stay here and let us protect you.\N-I'm not bait. I post today. You posted 20 minutes ago. Capt. Leo wants you out of here. -Unless you turn state's.\N-I'll take my chances. If someone wants to get you,\Nthey're gonna get you out there. Turn state's evidence.\NYou might never see trial. Maybe so. But I'm not a rat. Fuckin' cops. Excuse me, can I use your fax machine? You'll have to sign for these, Mr. Kint. One watch, gold. One cigarette lighter, gold. One pack of cigarettes. Thank you. We still got nothing. I know what I wanted to know\Nabout Keaton. Which is nothing. No matter.\NHe'll have to know how close we came. <i>Keyser Soze or no Keyser Soze...</i> <i>...if Keaton is alive,</i>\N<i>he's not comin' up again.</i> <i>I'll find him.</i> <i>Waste of time.</i> <i>A rumor's not a rumor that doesn't die.</i> <i>What?</i> <i>Nothing.</i> Man, you're a slob. But it all has a system. It all makes sense if you look at it right.\NYou gotta stand back from it. You wanna see a real horror show?\NSee my garage. <i>Convince me. Tell me every last...</i> <i>When I was in that barbershop quartet</i>\N<i>in Skokie, Illinois...</i> <i>-Where's your head?</i>\N<i>-We need to think, think back.</i> <i>I'm sure you've heard tall tales.</i> <i>-Bricks Marlin.</i>\N<i>-This isn't right.</i> <i>-I just wanna hear your story.</i>\N<i>-It's all there.</i> <i>-I'm tellin' it straight.</i>\N<i>-Some guy in California called Redfoot.</i> <i>-A gift from Mr. Soze.</i>\N<i>-Talk to me.</i> <i>-What about Redfoot?</i>\N<i>-Mr. Redfoot knew nothing.</i> <i>-Using pawns...</i>\N<i>-A big fat guy.
