I have found almost everything\Never written about love... ...to be true. Shakespeare said,\N"Journeys end in lovers meeting." What an extraordinary thought. Personally, I have not experienced\Nanything remotely close to that... ...but I'm more than willing to believe\NShakespeare had. I suppose I think about love\Nmore than anyone really should. I'm constantly amazed by its sheer\Npower to alter and define our lives. It was Shakespeare who also said,\N"Love is blind." Now, that is something\NI know to be true. For some, quite inexplicably... ...love fades. For others... ...love is simply lost. But then, of course,\Nlove can also be found. Even if just for the night. And then there's\Nanother kind of love. The cruelest kind. The one that almost kills its victims. It's called unrequited love. Of that, I am an expert... Most love stories are about people\Nwho fall in love with each other. But what about the rest of us?\NWhat about our stories? Those of us who fall in love alone. We are the victims\Nof the one-sided affair. We are the cursed\Nof the loved ones. We are the unloved ones.\NThe walking wounded. The handicapped without the\Nadvantage of a great parking space. Yes, you are looking at one\Nsuch individual. And I have willingly loved... ...that man for over\Nthree miserable years. The absolute worst years of my life. The worst Christmases,\Nthe worst birthdays. New Year's Eves brought in\Nby tears and Valium. These years I've been in love have\Nbeen the darkest days of my life... ...all because I'm cursed by being\Nin love with a man who does not... ...and will not love me back. Oh, God, just the sight of him. Heart. Pounding, throat thickening,\Nabsolutely can't swallow. All the usual symptoms. Oh, Jasper. - Don't tell me you're still...\N- No, no, no, that's over. Very over. What's the story with you two anyway?\NYou were shagging him, weren't you? More importantly, I was in love\Nwith him, truth be known. Then you found out he was shagging\Nthat drip from Circulation. Which is when I stopped\Nshagging him. We shouldn't be talking\Nabout this at the office party. But I always see you two together. He cheated on you,\Nbut you stayed friends? I was head over heels, you know?\NEveryone knew. - Does it look like I'm crying right now?\N- No, no, no. No, it just looks like it's the smoke\Nfrom my cigarette. Did he ever actually tell you\Nthat he loved you back? Yes. Three, almost four times.\NAnd when I reminded him of that... ...he said it must have been an answer\Nto a question. Which, by the way,\Nit absolutely was not. You know, Iris, when you catch\Nyour guy with another woman... ...you're not supposed\Nto stay friends with him. You're supposed to never\Ntalk to the prick again. You're supposed to throw things\Nat him, scream, call him names. Not do his blooming laundry. I don't do his laundry. Did someone tell you\NI do his laundry? No, no, all we do now is... ...we e-mail. Not when he's with her, of course. Also when he's not with her,\Nwe talk on the phone. Sometimes for hours. And then\Nthere's the occasional long lunch. You know, I never realized\Nhow pathetic you are. Really? Oh, God. I'm so aware of it. They always know just\Nhow to get us, don't they? He knows whenever he wants\Nback in your life... Actually, he has made some small\Ncomments like that recently. He hasn't exactly come\Nright out and said it... Iris, did you file your story? Oh, no, not yet.\NDown to the wire. Sorry. Better go. ...groom's best friend spoke... ...for many guests\Nwhen he said, "Hilary... ...will open Edward's eyes... ...and round out his life." Okay, I've got a question for you. What's it like to be the only one\Ncommitted to work... ...while the rest of us\Nare slumming? You mean what's it like\Nto be the only one... ...not to finish their work on time? Hold on. Don't... Don't go. Is it fun having a brain\Nthat works that fast? - Shut up.\N- No, I mean it. Probably a brilliant finish too. I assure you it's not. - Hi, Simpkey.\N- Hi. Your column today was fantastic. God, I loved that line: "The onrushing stripping of dignity\Nand thought from British lives." Great writing. Hey, I got you something\Nfor Christmas. That's convenient\Nbecause I got you something too. Darling, I don't actually\Nhave my gift with me. In fact, I probably mislaid it,\Nbut I know I got you something. I suspect it's somewhere in my car,\Nwant to know what it is? No. No, no, that's okay. I know you're gonna look hot in it. Well, let's hope you find it, then. Not exactly something hot... ...but happy Christmas. Thank you. I didn't think we'd get a chance\Nto do this this year. Remember last Christmas,\Nwe exchanged gifts in March. This is good. We're getting better. You stinker. It's a first edition. Where did you find it? Buried in that little place we found\Nin Covent Garden that time. Why are you so great? Everyone, can I have\Nyour attention, please? Just a couple of minutes.\NThank you. I hate it that we can never talk. Hate it. Well, first of all, a very\Nhappy Christmas to every one of you. Happy Christmas. Now, we're not officially closed,\Nas you very well know. But we are going to try\Nand get by this week... ...with a smaller-than-normal staff. Now, before some of you\Nrush off on holiday... ...I do have one\Nrather important announcement. Now, this affects Iris. - Iris Simpkins, where are you?\N- Here, sir. - Iris, I have a tip for you.\N- Excellent. A wedding was privately\Nannounced earlier today... ...that I don't believe any other paper\Nin town knows about. And I want you to be the first to report\Non this particular union... ...as it is between two of our\Nmost esteemed colleagues. May I introduce the newly engaged\NSarah Smith-Alcott... ...and Jasper Bloom! Come on. If I had known this was going\Nto happen, I'd have worn my good suit. Amanda! Amanda. Look, may I just say again... ...that I did not sleep with her? Right, because your receptionist\Nneeds to work till 3 in the morning. A bunch of us were working all night.\NShe wanted to hang out. Okay. Then swear on my life\Nthat you didn't sleep with her. Come on. Go ahead. Look, I don't wanna...\NI'm not gonna... Your receptionist, Ethan? This is why I knew we were smart\Nnever to get married. I told you never to get rid\Nof your house. Somewhere inside\NI knew this about you. First of all, can you please\Ncalm down? Because I did not\Nsleep with her. Secondly, we've had problems\Nfor over a year. And I know you don't wanna deal\Nwith that, but we have. Oh, I am well aware we've\Nhad problems for the last year. If I work a little bit too much,\NI never stop hearing about it. But if you work too much,\Nmaestro... ...it's for the sake of your music.\N- "If" you work too much? Amanda, you cut\N75 trailers this year. You put a cutting room in the house\Nand sleep with your BlackBerry. And I'm not gonna have\Na conversation about sex... ...because I can't remember\Nthe last time we did it. Come on, nobody has time for sex. That's not entirely true. That's it!\NYou absolutely slept with her! Seriously, you have to get out. Oh, God. You know what I really think, Ethan? - I don't think you ever really loved me.\N- Oh, please. You loved the idea of you and me, but\Nnot so much me. Not me, not really. Look, I did the best I could.\NIs anybody good enough for that job? I will send you your things. You know you do this, right? I mean, you screw up\Nevery relationship you've ever been in. It's what you do. You didn't really wanna be a couple!\NYou resist it in your own way! Shut up! And it's hard to detect\Nhow you even do it... ...because nobody's quite\Nas smart as you! So you're hard to catch at it. But it always surfaces\Nand this is what happens. - What happens?\N- Things end. Just like you knew they would. Amanda, you know how I feel\Nabout you. There's nobody like you. You just don't wanna be\Nwhat I need. - Well, not what I "need."\N- What? I mean...\NYou know what I mean. You know, I would never cheat on you,\Nnot under any conditions. Neither would I, okay? Look at me. I'm down here\Nsweating like a pig. And look at you. The only woman on Earth\Nwho breaks up with her boyfriend... ...and doesn't even shed a tear? I mean,\Nthat's gotta mean something, right? Why does it bug you so much\Nthat I can't cry? Esophageal spasm. Oh, God, it's a big one. - No, it's okay. I'll be all right.\N- I know, I know. I'm thinking about me. Ethan. Look, it's over. You know, we might as well\Nbe honest with each other. Just tell me. Did you sleep with her? Just say it. What's the difference at this point,\Nright? I mean, why torture me? Just put me out of my misery. - What are we doing here...?\N- Okay. Yes, okay? I slept with her.\NAre you happy? I've been sleeping with her.\NShe's in love with me. She's young. Look, this is not a proud moment\Nfor me. I mean, you should just know that. Amanda! Did you say, am I happy? I didn't mean that. You get me nuts\Nsometimes, I say things I don't mean. In the world of love, Ethan... ...not that I'm such a genius at it... ...but in the world of love,\Ncheating is not acceptable. No matter what you think... I know you have a very high opinion\Nof yourself, but this isn't all me. - Okay.\N- So when you're not in such a rage... ...I think you'll see that too.\N- Yeah, maybe. Maybe when I stop having visions\Nof you two together... ...I will see your side. You gotta be... Punched him in the face. - Is this a bad time?\N- No, no, I'm just... - I'm just flipping out a little bit.\N- Oh, okay. God. Okay... No. I'm okay.\NGod, why would this happen? No. You know what? I'm all right. Hi. What's up? Ben needs you. Rebecca Green was just your\Naverage 20-year-old. Until the father she never knew left\Nher something she never expected. Don't scream. - Your father left you something.\N- I never met my father. - Now you know he was interesting.\N- Lindsay Lohan. James Franco. - Deception.\N- You happen to have two guns? I didn't think one would be enough. Christmas Day. Amazing! It finally looks like a hit. And that is why they pay you\Nthe big bucks. I think we should go back\Nto the original cut on the end. - It's so much stronger.\N- I agree. And make "Christmas Day"\Ntwice as big... ...but try it in a red. Like a happy red,\Nnot like a Scorsese red. Happy red. Okay, so we're done. - Great.\N- All right. Hey, you know, let's just take off\Nfor a few weeks. - Yeah.\N- What do you mean? I'm not kidding. You always say that\Nthis is our busiest time. I need to get out of town. You know? I think I need\Nsome peace and quiet... ...or whatever it is people\Ngo away for. You know what I really wanna do? I wanna eat carbs without\Nwanting to kill myself. I wanna read a book.\NNot just a magazine. An actual book. For years, I read these reviews,\NI buy the books, but I never read them. Did you read that article in\NThe New York Times last Sunday? Severe stress makes women\Nage prematurely... ...because stress causes DNA\Nin our cells to shrink... ...until they can no longer replicate. So when we're stressed,\Nwe look haggard. - This is just women, not men.\N- I'm sorry. They used to say that... ...single women over 35 were\Nmore likely to be killed by a terrorist... ...than to get married.\NThat was horrible. But now our generation\Nis also not getting married. And bonus, real terrorists\Nactually became part of our lives. So the stress of it all shows up on our\Nfaces, making us look haggard. While Ethan goes on\Nlooking cute forever... ...shtupping his\N24-year-old receptionist! Oh, my God! See what I mean? I need a vacation. Okay, where do I wanna go? By myself at Christmas. By myself depressed at Christmas. All alone on vacation. Alone, alone. Totally alone. Please, just give me one. One tear. Okay. Moving on. "Worry-Free vacations." Good. Where's that? Bora Bora. "Kayak for one?" No, thank you. "Vacation Rentals." I could do that. Hole up in a house somewhere.\NDisappear for a few weeks. I like that idea. "Where do you wanna go\Non your next vacation?" "Click here and pick a country." Where do they speak English? "Click on a town or city." Let's see. Cotswolds. "Barn converted to modern house\Nin the beautiful Cotswolds." Which looks exactly like the valley. Surrey. "Christmas in the country." "A fairy-tale English cottage\Nset in a tranquil country garden. Snuggle up by an old stone fireplace\Nand enjoy a cup of cocoa. An enchanting oasis of tranquility\Nin a quiet English hamlet... ...just 40 minutes\Nfrom exciting London." Yeah. What am I doing? Low point. Low point. "I'm interested... Renting your house. I'm wondering if your house\Nis available this Christmas. Because if it is,\Nyou could be a real lifesaver." "I know it's late to be asking... ...but if you're at all interested,\Nplease contact me." "I'm very interested, but the cottage\Nis only available for home exchange." "Home exchange"? What is that? "We switch houses, cars,\Neverything. I haven't done it before,\Nbut friends have." Where are you? Please say somewhere far away. "L.A." Never been there.\NAlways wanted to go. I'm Iris, by the way. I'm very normal. Neat freak. Healthy. Non-smoker. Single. Hate my horrible life. I'm Amanda. Loner, loser and complicated wreck. Hi. Hi. I must say... ...your house looks idyllic. "Just what I need." Really? What does your place look like? My place is nice,\Nbut it's a little bigger than yours. "Are there any men in your town?" Honestly? "Tomorrow's perfect." Okay. We are on for two weeks... ...starting tomorrow. Hi. - Hi.\N- How are you? - Fine.\N- Honey, we're sitting there. Sorry. Oh, yes. There it is. - Well, hello, dear.\N- Hello. Excuse me. There we go. - I'm so sorry.\N- No, no, it's okay. - Did you step on her foot?\N- It's okay. Oh, dear. Clumsy me. Amanda Woods is proud to present\NHer Life. - She had it all;\N- Yes, that's it. The job. The house. The guy. This holiday season... ...find out\Nwhat Amanda doesn't have. This is amazing, this is amazing! Oh, look at that. Madam? Madam? - Madam?\N- Yeah. - We're here.\N- Okay. This can't be it. No, it's just down that lane. But the thing is, I'll never be able\Nto turn this around at the other end. Think you can make it from here? No. Hey. You wouldn't happen to know\Nwhere Rosehill Cottage is? Go right at the bridge, and then\Njust keep going. Way down there. Okay. I'm here! Holy shit. Oh, my God! Okay, that'll be interesting. Get in the... Get in there. Okay. Cute dress. Oh, suitcase. Okay. Now what? I can do this. I can drive\Non the wrong side of the road... ...and the wrong side of the car. Just stay focused. Oh, please do not hit me! Okay, I hate this. Oh, God. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. - Move out of the way!\N- Watch it! Sorry. Stop! Oh, God. I need a drink. Someone's having a party tonight. Oh, yeah. - They went to the shops.\N- Didn't see anything. Came home,\Nand had a bit of a kiss and cuddle. The end. Rebecca Green\Nwas just your average 20-year-old. Until the father she never knew... ...left her something\Nshe never expected. - You happen to have two guns?\N- I didn't think one would be enough. Deception. Christmas Day. And that's why they pay me\Nthe big bucks. And now the weather. First,\NNort. Hern England and Nort. H Wales... ...will have sleet or snow in the\Nmorning and again later in the day. Blinked. Oh, that's intense. Oh, no. "Gate"? - Who was he with?\N- Maggie. - The flutes. This is the best part.\N- One second. Hello... Hello? - Hello? Can you hear me?\N- Yeah, it's Miles. Amanda? No, I'm sorry.\NAmanda's not here, I'm afraid. I'm trying to figure out\Nhow to open the gate. Oh, fu... very nice. If you heard that, I'm sorry. - Hi.\N- Hi. I'm so sorry.\NI'm new at the gate thing. It's okay. It was pretty funny. I'm Miles. I work with Ethan. Ethan? - Amanda's ex.\N- Oh, right. Right. Know when she'll be back?\NSupposed to pick up things. Amanda's in England,\Nactually, on holiday. I'm staying here while she's away. - You okay?\N- Yes. Yeah, something just\Nblew into my eye. Oh, I hate that. Let me see. Yep, you got something in\Nyour eyelash. You want me to get it? - Okay.\N- Okay. - Yeah, Santa Anas.\N- Pardon? The wind. It's what makes\Nit so warm this time of year. Legend has it,\Nwhen the Santa Anas blow... ...all bets are off.\NAnything can happen. That's it. You okay? Better. Thank you. So you needed to...? Pick up Ethan's laptop. And you're his...? Oh, well, I'm a film composer, too,\Nlike Ethan, but... - Did you compose this? It's beautiful.\N- This? Yes, I did. I wrote this. No, I didn't. I wish I did. This is the great Ennio Morricone. Would you mind\Ncoming back tomorrow? I just want to check this\Nwith Amanda's assistant. Sure. - I'm Iris, by the way.\N- Miles. - Right.\N- And this is my Maggie. I mean, just Maggie.\NNot "my" Maggie. - Hello.\N- Hey. - Are you ready?\N- Yeah. Okay. Don't blow away. I won't. Anything can happen. Five, six, seven, eight, nine,\N10, 11, 12. One a. M. In London. Who is it? It's me. Hurry up. It's freezing. - Who are you?\N- Iris, open the door... ...or I swear I'm gonna take a leak\Nall over your... You're not Iris. Or if you are,\NI'm much drunker than I realized. I'm sorry for my profanity. I wasn't expecting you. Well, I wasn't expecting you either. Nevertheless, may I just...? Yeah. Of course. Sure.\NYou had to... Yeah. I'm Graham. Iris' brother. Brother. I'm Amanda Woods.\NI'm staying here. Amandawoods?\NIs that all one word? No. No, it's not. Brother? Oh, my God. So Iris is... Where is...?\NWhere is she? She didn't tell you? She could have done... ...but as previously stated... ...I'm... I've just... I've been... She's in Los Angeles. That's not possible.\NIris never goes anywhere. Well, we have that in common. No, she listed this cottage on a\Nhome-exchange website and I found it. We switched houses for two weeks.\NFor the holiday. She's in L.A. at my house\Nand I'm here. - People actually do that?\N- Apparently. Yeah. I mean, it seems.\NHere I am in my pajamas. She did ring me last night. I didn't\Nget a chance to get back to her. I feel awful now. Would you mind if I sat?\NI feel like I might bump into you. Sure. Yeah. Sit. You okay? Yeah, I'm good. Look, I'm sorry about the intrusion. Although I may not appear it,\NI am in fact Iris'... ...semi-respectable big brother. But on the rare...\NOr lately not-so-rare occasion... ...that I frequent the local pub... ...and get inordinately pissed,\Nmy little sister puts me up... ...so I don't get behind the wheel. Pathetic explanation, but unfortunately\Nit's become a bit of a routine. So how's it going so far? I mean, up until I showed up\Nand ruined your night. Well, it's not going so great. Yeah, I'm leaving tomorrow\Non a noon plane. When did you get here? About six hours ago. We've made a great impression\Non you, haven't we? No, it's not that. It's just that... You know,\NI'm not quite myself right now. I came here on a stupid whim. Honestly, I've never thought about\Nanything less. It's very unlike me. Would you like something to drink? Glass of water? Tea? Wine, maybe? I think there's a bottle of brandy.\NFancy a glass? - Sure.\N- Good. So... I'm sorry, I've totally blanked\Nand forgotten your name. Amanda. So, Amanda... ...you're not married, are you? Why? Do I look not married? No. It was just a backwards way\Nof asking if you were married. No, not at all. I don't know what that means. I mean, no, I'm not married. Me neither. - Cheers.\N- Cheers. So is it horrible if I stay? I'll be gone\Nbefore you even wake up. I promise you will never\Nlay eyes on me again. Of... No, that's fine. Sure. - Thank you.\N- Let me just get you a blanket. In the cupboard,\Non top of the Scrabble. So why is it you aren't\Nquite yourself at the moment? Well, I just broke up with someone. Yesterday. And I guess\Nwhat I was feeling... ...was that I didn't wanna be alone\Nover the holidays. I thought that\Nif I was somewhere else... ...I wouldn't realize I was alone. Then I got here\Nand never felt more alone in my life. Big surprise. Bet you're glad you knocked\Non this door. I am, actually. Yeah, well... Sorry and good night. Sweet dreams. Do you think you could...? Would you mind... ...trying that again? Bad? Weird. Kissing a total stranger. Really? I do it all the time. Let me try this. Maybe if I closed my eyes. You know, given that\NI'm in a bit of a personal crisis... ...and I find myself\Nin a total stranger's home... ...in a town that I can't\Nactually remember the name of... ...and considering\Nthat you showed up... ...and you're, like,\Ninsanely good-looking... ...and really drunk and probably\Nwon't remember me anyway... ...I'm thinking... ...we should have sex. If you want. Is that a trick question? I'm actually serious. And not that it matters, but I've never\Nsaid anything like that in my entire life. It's just that this whole... ...knowing-I'll-never-see-you-again\Nthing is kind of exciting. I mean, this is what a vacation's\Nsupposed to be. You're supposed to vacate life,\Ndo the unexpected. And you are... ...definitely unexpected. This all sounded wonderful\Ntill I became the cabana boy. And you're funny,\Nwhich is, like, a bonus. Yeah? Never meet me\Nwhen I'm sober. Deal. Oh, also, I should warn you. I'm not very good at this. "This" being...? - Sex.\N- Okay. Now, that cannot be true. Nevertheless, the guy that I lived with\Nmentioned it once or twice... ...and a girl does not forget\Na comment like that. Not even me. I mean, how bad could I be? Sex is pretty basic, right? Am I\Npretty much talking you out of this? Strangely, not at all. How do you feel about foreplay? I think it's overrated. Significantly overrated. You are quickly becoming one of\Nthe most interesting girls I've ever met. Look at you. You're already better than you think. - Good morning.\N- Good morning. I lost my contacts\Nlast night somehow. - Much better.\N- Yeah. Can I help you with that? I should know how to do this. You're supposed to\Nplug them in over here. Right. - So, Amanda, I just really...\N- Yeah. You know... ...listen, you don't have to worry\Nabout a thing here. Okay? Okay. I mean, it was great\Nmeeting you and everything. Definitely. Also, for the record,\Nyour ex-boyfriend is, in my opinion... ...extremely mistaken about you. Well, yeah, you were drunk. - Not that drunk.\N- Yeah. Oh, that's mine. Sophie. I'm sorry,\NI didn't mean to look. I'll call her back. Coffee cups. - Here.\N- Thank you. You don't want one? I should probably be going. Oh, yeah. You know, I gotta get going\Nin a few minutes myself. So listen. I know you're leaving\Nand absolutely not interested... ...in getting involved,\Nbut just so you know... ...things in my life\Nare a little bit complicated... ...and even if you were staying,\NI can promise you... ...you wouldn't...\N- You really don't have to do this. Look, I'm sort of a mess\Nin this area myself. And anyway, I mean,\Nhonestly, we hardly know each other. Well, I wouldn't exactly say that... ...but I just want to assure you,\Nyou're better off. I'm... - I'm...\N- Okay. No need to go on. Right. Well, I just want to be sure\Nyou are okay because somehow... ...I find I tend to hurt women\Nsimply by being myself, so... I'm not going\Nto fall in love with you, I promise. Okay. Nicely put. Thank you. No, it's just that I know myself.\NI'm not sure I even fall in love. Not like the way other people do. How's that for something to admit? Well, like I said,\NMost Interesting Girl Award. I'm gonna try to see that\Nas a compliment. You should. Absolutely. Right. Okay, then. Well... Utter honesty. Very refreshing. Well, you probably\Nwon't be hearing from me... ...because even if you wanted to,\Nand you clearly don't... ...I have the classic\Nmale problem of no follow-through. Absolutely never remember\Nto call after a date. But since this wasn't a date\NI guess I'm off the hook. Exactly. But what if I wanted to call you? Right. Sorry. Apparently not\Nthe right thing to say at all. Well, if your flight's canceled\Nor for some reason... ...you change your mind, I'm having\Ndinner with some friends... ...at the pub tonight. And... ...if not, then, well... ...you're lovely. So are you. Attention passengers,\Nthis is the final boarding call... ...for British Airways flight 42. Amanda wasn't looking for love... ...but that doesn't mean\Nit didn't find her. Well, ma'am, you're good to go. Thank you. Thank you, Amanda. Hello? Where am I finding you? Jasper. Is it okay that I'm calling you? I suppose so. How are you? Could we start.\NWith a less complicated question? What's wrong? I'm having some real problems\Nwith a section of my book. I can use some Iris. Would it be awful\Nif I sent you some pages? Just tell me if it is.\NI don't wanna mess you up. I'll... I know that you're the only one\Nwho can really help me. No. Well... I mean... ...if you need me. Well, you know\Nyou are my little survival kit. So, Simpkey, have you put on\Nthat little red bikini yet? You know,\Nthe one that unties at the back? How do you remember\Nmy little red bikini? I remember everything. Do you? You know, just the other day,\NI was just thinking about that time... Darling, I've just arrived\Nat Soho House. I'm meeting some friends for drinks. - Okay.\N- You keep the change. Bloody cold in here. Okay, I'm sending you\Nthe pages tomorrow. Look for them, will you?\NAnd have some fun today, okay? Okay. Graham? Oh, no, is he lost? Excuse me. Hello. Can I offer you a lift home? Why? You know where I live? I believe I do, yes. Good. Then that makes one of us. Your house is lovely. I've lived here 47 years. Back then, there were only\Nsix houses on this block. Every year,\Nthey tear another one down... ...not that I blame them. They weren't that great\Nto begin with. But that's how I got confused.\NI didn't recognize one house. That would be confusing. What part of England are you from? - Surrey.\N- Cary Grant was from Surrey. That's right, he was. - How did you know that?\N- Oh, he told me once. Well, I thank you very much,\Nyoung lady. Let me help you with that. Okay. I... Thank you. There you go. Well, this was some meet-cute. - Sorry?\N- It's how two characters meet... ...in a movie. Say a man and a woman... ...both need something to sleep in. And they both go\Nto the same men's pajama department. - Right.\N- And the man says to the salesman: "I just need bottoms."\NThe woman says, "I just need a top." They look at each other,\Nand that's the "meet-cute." Oh, I see. Of course, this isn't\Nquite that cute, but... So you're in the film business? Was. Yes, yes, I was. I was a writer. I could be here till tomorrow. Oh, here. Let me. Thank you. Oh, my God. Well, goodbye, then. I enjoyed our meet-cute. Well, thank you.\NThank you for rescuing me. It's a pleasure. Absolutely. You know, I hope you\Ndon't find this strange... ...but I've just arrived here,\Nand, well, I don't really know anyone. And I was thinking of going out\Nfor dinner tonight. Well, if you're not busy,\Nwould you like to join me? Busy? Honey,\NI haven't been busy since 1978. I learned everything\Nworking in this place. - Best job I ever had.\N- Wait, wait, wait. That was your first job\Nin Hollywood? Louis B. Mayer's office boy? Actually, my first job\Nwas as a Western Union messenger. That's how I met Mayer. I delivered\Na telegram to his office at MGM. When I walked in, all the girls\Nin the office were in a tizzy. Their office boy didn't show up. I volunteered for the job.\NThe next day, I was on the payroll. I was 17 years old. So was Hollywood really as great\Nback then as I imagine? It was better. You know what I've been\Nasking myself all night? What? Why I'm bothering you\Nwith all these questions? I'm wondering\Nwhy a beautiful girl like you... ...would go to a stranger's house\Nfor her Christmas vacation... ...and on top of that, spend Saturday\Nnight with an old cocker like me. Well, I... I just wanted to get away\Nfrom the people I see all the time. Well, not all the people. One person. I wanted to get away from one guy. An ex-boyfriend who just got engaged\Nand forgot to tell me. - Sorry.\N- So he's a schmuck. As a matter of fact, he is.\NA huge schmuck. - How did you know?\N- He let you go. This is not a hard one to figure out. Iris, in the movies\Nwe have leading ladies... ...and we have the best friend. You, I can tell, are a leading lady. But for some reason,\Nyou're behaving like the best friend. You're so right. You're supposed to be the leading\Nlady of your own life, for God's sake. Arthur, I've been going\Nto a therapist for three years. And she's never explained\Nanything to me that well. That was brilliant. Brutal, but brilliant. Thank you. I haven't had that much to drink in... What am I saying? - I've never had that much to drink.\N- Yes, I believe no one ever has. Okay, the last thing I remember\Nwas coming in here last night and... - I had nothing to do with that.\N- Oh, I know, but you were here. - I was.\N- Oh, God. So I guess we... Did we...? I mean, did we...? - We didn't?\N- We did not. Oh, thank God. I mean, not "thank God,"\Nbut just thank God. Because I didn't remember... So why didn't we...?\NJust remind me a little. Call me old-fashioned... ...but one doesn't have sex\Nwith women who are unconscious. Unconscious? Oh, God. That must have been\Nreally attractive. Why did you stay? Because you asked me to. I did, didn't I? Did I beg at one point? From the moment I met you,\Nit's been an adventure. Oh, yes. And I am deeply sorry about that.\NI have nothing to say for myself... ...other than I must be\Ntemporarily nuts right now. Olivia. Sorry, I didn't mean to look. - Again.\N- I should probably take this. Hello. Hi. I can't. I can't today. Sophie, Olivia, Amanda. Busy guy. - I think we should go into town.\N- What do you mean? I think you should get dressed. We should take a drive, get some\Nlunch and get to know each other. Really? Why? Because I'm running out of reasons\Nwhy we shouldn't. Aren't you? - So you're a book editor.\N- Yes, I am. - What kind of an editor are you?\N- A very mean one. No. What I meant was,\Ndo you give massive notes, or...? The better the writer,\Nthe less notes. - And what'd you study in school?\N- Literature. And did you always know\Nthis was what you wanted to do? Okay, my palms\Nare starting to sweat. I feel like I'm on a job interview. Do you, by any chance,\Nknow how to be on a date? - Sorry. I'm interrogating you.\N- Yes. I haven't been on a first date\Nin a long time. Well, since we've already had sex\Nand slept together twice... ...maybe we can bend\Nthe first-date rules. Why are you blushing? I didn't realize I was.\NI think you make me nervous. Okay. I'm gonna try to be myself.\NIt's never easy, but I'm gonna try. What was the question? Oh, I know. - Did I always want to be a book editor?\N- Did you...? Right. The answer is yes.\NMy family's in publishing. My dad's a writer\Nof historical fiction. My mum was... Is, to this day, a very important editor\Nat Random House. Okay. I believe my time is up.\NYour turn. Really? - Deep breath.\N- Okay. - All right?\N- Yeah. Well, like I said the other night... ...I own a company\Nthat does movie advertising. I didn't realize\Nyou own the company. Probably because\NI didn't mention it. But now that I know you were raised\Nby such a strong working mom... ...I can say it,\Nand maybe you won't be intimidated. No, no.\NI'm still a little intimidated by it. Well, "a little"\Nis way ahead of the curve. - Yeah.\N- What about your family? Okay, I'll say it fast. My parents broke up when I was 15. I'm an only child, and I...\NI didn't see it coming. You know, we were really close. We used to call ourselves\N"The Three Musketeers." And one night after dinner,\Nmy parents sat me down... ...and told me that\Nthey were breaking up. I thought they were kidding. And then I saw a suitcase out of\Nthe corner of my eye in the hallway. And my dad moved out that night. I think I cried myself to sleep\Nfor, like, well... Anyway, a long time. And then I realized\Nthat I'd better toughen up. And, well, I got through it\Nand sort of haven't cried since. I also haven't thought of\Nthat packed suitcase maybe ever. And that's my tragic little story. - Let's order.\N- Wait. You haven't cried\Nsince you were 15? I know it must mean something awful.\NI know, but... You know, I try, but... Believe me. But can we talk about you\Nsome more, please? Okay. Yes. Absolutely. Okay.\NWell, I cry all the time. - You do not.\N- Yeah, I do. More than any woman\Nyou've ever met. You don't have to be this nice. - It happens to be the truth.\N- Really? A good book, a great film,\Na birthday card, I weep. - Shut up.\N- I'm a major weeper. I am. - This was such a great afternoon.\N- It was a really great afternoon. You know, you don't have\Nto walk me in. It's freezing, and... You can just say\Nyou don't want me to come in. No, it's not that. I just... No... I'm just tired.\NI think I'm gonna take a nap. - It's not that.\N- Okay, I'll pretend I believe you. Graham, I'm leaving in nine days. And that makes this complicated. And I'm not sure I can handle\Ncomplicated right now. Okay. And that doesn't make things\Ncomplicated? Sex makes everything complicated. Even when you don't have it, the not\Nhaving it makes things complicated. Which is why it's usually better\Nto have it. Some say. Well, I'm off to work in the morning. I promise I won't be drunkenly\Nbanging on your door any time soon. We'll see each other, okay?\NWe'll figure something out. - Good.\N- Good. Oh, it's freezing. - Hi.\N- Hello. - Bad timing?\N- No, no. Come in. - How's it going?\N- Good. Yeah, everything's good. This FedEx was leaning\Non the gate. From a little town\Ncalled London, England. Friend of mine's writing a book,\Nand I give him... ...notes sometimes. - You have company?\N- I'm having a little Hanukkah party. Did you join a temple\Nsince I last saw you? No. My neighbor knew\NI didn't know anyone here. So he wanted to introduce me\Nto some of his friends. And somehow it turned into\Na Hanukkah thing. Do you wanna come in for a sec? All right. Yeah.\NI could play spin the dreidel. Smells good. I just have to say, this is one of\Nthe best Hanukkahs I've ever had. Hear, hear. I've had too much of the Manischewitz.\NI'm gonna have to be cut off. We are cutting you off. I take this very seriously,\Nand I'm telling you the truth. He amazes me. Don't listen to them. They're nuts. Okay, so you're telling me\Nyou were not a ladies' man? Never. I married very young. Yes, only because\Nhe had the greatest girl in town. He had to take her off the market. - That's the truth.\N- Everyone loved Marion. She had the greatest laugh. What did he say?\NShe had the greatest ass? Greatest laugh. Although her ass\Nwasn't so bad, either. She had real gumption.\NShe was the girl I always wrote. What about you, Miles?\NYou're a man about town, I presume. No, gents, sadly I am not. I'm just\Na one-woman-at-a-time kind of guy. Actually, I've been dating a beautiful\Nactress for about five months. I do not know what she sees in me,\Nbut I'm the luckiest guy in the world. Oh, she's an actress?\NWhat's she been in? - Anything we would have seen?\N- She hasn't done that much yet, but... And where is she tonight? Look, he's half-dead,\Nand he's still interested. Well, I mean, that made me curious.\NYou know, he's here. Where is she? She's on location in New Mexico.\NShe's working on a little indie film. Sorry she couldn't be here.\NShe'll be back in about 10 days. Her loss is our gain. - Thank you, Arthur.\N- Fellas... ...I think we should leave these young\Nfolks and get back to our bedpans. Okay, Norman,\Nyou are calling me for pinochle. - I got your cell, I'll be in touch.\N- Okay, pound right here. This was an amazing night. Arthur Abbott is maybe the last\Nof the great Hollywood writers... ...from that generation. Thanks. There are, like, famous things we say\Nbecause he wrote them. I know. He told me\Nthat his friends wrote Casablanca... ...but that he added the "kid"\Nto "Here's looking at you, kid." Hello! Which totally makes the line. "Here's looking at you, llsa." Doesn't quite have that ring. He's so modest. He gave me this long\Nlist of old movies he said I had to see. None were written by him,\Nof course. I saw a couple today.\NThey were fantastic. Maybe we can see one together. - That would be great.\N- All right, cool. Then I'll definitely call you. The brisket was great. And those\Nchocolate-covered macaroons. Delectable. It was really fun\Nhanging with you. Okay. I'm sorry.\NI didn't mean to kiss you twice... ...and then linger a long time\Non the second kiss. - No problem.\N- Oh, boy. It is officially crazy weather. Don't blow away. "I'm not sure\NI can handle complicated"? Oh, God, I can be such a jerk. - Amanda Woods.\N- Shut up. She pushed every guy away,\Nevery time. It's not, "Will she ever change" but,\N"Does she want to?" - Surprise.\N- Yeah, it is. Hi. Hi. So I was home doing nothing\Nand thinking of you... ...and I realized that a little\Ncomplication never hurt anyone. And then I thought,\Nmaybe this isn't so complicated at all. And also, I wanted to apologize. I am sorry I didn't\Ninvite you in this afternoon. I don't know what that\Nwas about exactly... ...but whatever it was,\NI thought that I should just... Oh, my God. You're,\Nyou're not alone, are you? No, I'm not, actually. - I'm sorry.\N- No. No, no, no. Don't be. I shouldn't have just...\NOh, man. Okay, seriously,\Ndo not worry about this. This is just me, like, being stupid. Who is it, Daddy? - "Daddy"?\N- Yes. I am Daddy. Amanda, this is my\Ndaughter Sophie. Soph, this is my friend Amanda. - Hi.\N- How do you do? I'm fine, thank you. How are you? Very well, thank you.\NDo you want to come in? Oh, no, I just... Hi. Come here. Daddy, who is this? This is Amanda. And, Amanda,\Nthis is my youngest. Olivia. Sophie and Olivia. Dad. - Dad.\N- Sorry, yes. Of course, come in. Come in. Okay. Daddy, can we still have\Nhot chocolate, please? - Yes.\N- With baby marshmallows? Yes. Dad, take her coat. - Yes. May I, may I...?\N- Oh, sure. Thanks. Are you married? Tell me fast. - No.\N- Okay. I know. I'm a tad overdressed. You look like my Barbie. - Thanks.\N- Is that for us? Yes. Except for I'm sorry\Nabout the wine. I apologize for not\Nhaving mentioned this earlier. You're D-I-v-O-R-C-E-D? W-I-D-O-W-E-R. Two years ago. Amanda, are you by any chance\Nat all into hot chocolate? As a matter of fact, I'm... ...totally into it. - Here we go, Olivia. Olivia...\N- Thank you. ...blow on it. It's hot. You too, Soph. She has more marshmallows\Nthan me. No, she doesn't.\NYou each have five. - You have five too.\N- Thank you. One, two, three, four, five. What? Do I have something\Non my lip? Just look! There. - Oh, hello.\N- Hello. - Hello.\N- Going up! Blow on mine. Thank you. Excellent timing. Dad, do Mr. Napkin Head. - No. No, no, no. No Mr. Napkin Head.\N- Please? Do it! - Do it. Do it. Please.\N- Do it, please. Beg you, please? Please? Okay, I'll do it quickly. - Oh, well, thank you for that.\N- You're welcome. Now do it. All right. Amanda, can I borrow\Nyour napkin, please? Yes. Your glasses. Pass me those when I need them. Amanda, you're gonna love this. It's so funny. I mean, you'll fall\Noff your chair, it's so funny. Hello. Hello, my name is Mr. Napkin Head. - Hello, children.\N- Who's this? She's a stranger? - Amanda.\N- And why has she got a funny accent? - Amanda.\N- Yeah, but where is she from? Now smoke! Go on. Smoking's really bad for you. Amanda, guess what. We have a tent in our playroom.\NDo you want to see it? No, no, no. Amanda... ...will not crawl into your tent. You don't like tents? Okay, this is seriously cool. Come inside. - Lie down.\N- Okay. Here, Amanda.\NYou can use my pillow. - Thank you.\N- Lie down! Can you please\Nstop being so bossy? - Lie down, please, next to me.\N- Okay. Very nice. Excuse me. This is an exceptionally great tent. It's got something, hasn't it? - It's cozy.\N- Yeah. Who cut out\Nall these beautiful stars? - We did.\N- The Three Musketeers! Amanda? - Yes?\N- You smell lovely. Do I? Yes. I love perfume,\Nbut he won't let me wear it. Because you already smell so good. - So do you, by the way.\N- Thanks. - But I'm older, so I guess I'm allowed.\N- Exactly. I like your eye shadow. Thank you. - And your lipstick.\N- Thank you. - It's new.\N- What's it called? I think it's called Berry Kiss. Very Berry Kiss it is. Berry Kiss. Let's see? It looks good on you. Amanda? You know, if you wanted to sleep over,\Nthat would be all right. We could push our beds together. Sorry. That's so sweet of you\Nto invite me... ...but maybe another time.\NWould that be all right? Yes. Good girl. We never have grownups here\Nthat are girls. I know. I really like it. Me too. I can't imagine anyone being\Na bigger hit with my children. They're really great, Graham. Sophie's unfortunately taken\Non the role as my protector. She's brilliant, but I hate it\Nwhen she worries about me. And Olivia's... ...gonna be a real ball-buster. Which, I must admit,\NI kind of love about her. I'm trying to figure out\Nwhy you didn't tell me about them. Because I just don't usually\Ntell women about them. But it's just a little confusing... ...because you're the one\Nwho wanted to go out to lunch... ...to get to know one another. When you put it that way,\Nit sounds awful. I have no defense. Except that until\NI get to know someone really well... ...it's easier for me to\Nbe a normal, single guy. Because it's way too complicated\Nto be who I really am. I'm a full-time dad. I'm a working parent.\NI'm a mother and a father. I'm a guy who reads parenting books\Nand cookbooks before I go to sleep. I spend my weekends buying tutus.\NI'm learning to sew. I'm Mr. Napkin Head! I'm on some kind of\Nconstant overload and it helps... ...to compartmentalize my life.\NJust till I figure this out. This past weekend, the children\Nwere with their grandparents. And when they're gone,\NI get to be somebody... ...who doesn't have hot chocolate\Nspilled on his jeans. I have no idea how to date\Nand be this. And I suppose there's... ...the possibility I'm afraid\Nof what another person... ...might do to who we are... ...and how we get from\None day to the next. Yeah. I guess since I am\Nleaving in a week, I... I sort of get you not telling me. - Sort of.\N- I thought it would be hard... ...to introduce them to someone\NI may never see again. Right. Because I'm just someone you had\Nsex with once and slept with twice. I thought I was just someone you had\Nsex with once and slept with twice. Oh, man. I think we just went\Nway past complicated. Right. I'm a book editor\Nfrom London. You're a... ...beautiful... ...movie trailer-maker from L.A. We're worlds apart. I have a cow in the back yard. - You have a cow?\N- Yeah. I sew and I have a cow. How's that for hard to relate to? Pretty up there. Exactly. - Morning, Jesus.\N- Good morning. - Santa Anas?\N- Oh, yeah, long time now. - Hi, Marta.\N- Hi, Iris. Hi there. Hello! Good morning. I counted. Nine movies are opening today. I remember when nine movies\Nwould open in a month. Now a picture has to make a killing\Nthe first weekend or they're dead. This is supposed to be conducive\Nto great work? Arthur, have you always\Nbeen this feisty? Well, I may have slowed down\Na little, but yes. You've gotta fight the fight, kid. Okay, your mail. Gas company, phone bill. And a letter from the\NWriters Guild of America, West. Are you watching the movies\NI recommended? Yes! Love them.\NIrene Dunne is fantastic. - Gumption.\N- Oh, my God, tons of it. Arthur, don't you want to open that\Nletter you just threw in the bin? No. They keep writing me\Nabout the same thing. But it might be important. It's not. They want to arrange\Nsome kind of tribute to me. A night with me. I don't know. It sounds God-awful. What are you talking about?\NThat sounds brilliant! Would you like to walk out on a stage,\Non a walker, looking 100 years old... ...and see 11 schnooks\Nwho showed up just to see you? They can forget it. I ain't falling for this. So now, what's up? May I? "An Evening With Arthur Abbott." "Dear Mr. Abbott... several\Nattempts to contact you regarding..." "We have not yet received\Nyour response. This special night\Nwill be a tribute to your... ...lifetime screenwriting achievement\Nand contribution to the profession. Congratulations on this\Nmuch-deserved honor." Arthur, this is a big deal. You know, and they want\Nto do this soon. Listen, I reckon\Nthat with a little bit of exercise... ...you could walk out on your own. And, you know,\Nmaybe I could go with you. As, like, your date or something. I would take you proudly,\Nmy darling, but I'm not going. Anyway, how would you propose\Nto get me in shape? Seriously. Easy. You're doing really well. Nearly there. Nearly there.\NNearly there. Bravo! Here we go,\Nback the other way. - You okay?\N- Yeah, I'm fine. - You sure?\N- Yeah, I just slipped. - Hello?\N- So are you ever coming home? - Oh, my God. Hi.\N- How's it going? Great. I met a really nice guy. See? And you said you'd never.\NWhat's he like? He's really cute. I feel great\Nwhen I'm with him... ...which is an entirely new experience.\NAnd he's about 90 years old. - Come on.\N- He's my next-door neighbor. Or Amanda's next-door neighbor.\NBy the way, you should go meet her. - Yeah. I have, actually.\N- Oh, bugger. Call waiting. Can you hold for a sec? Hold on.\NI really wanna talk to you. - Sure.\N- Hello. - Iris, hi, it's Amanda.\N- How are you? How's it going? - Everything's great. How are you?\N- Oh, I'm loving it. Can you hold for a sec?\NMy brother's on the other line. - Graham?\N- Yes. He said you met. - Yes, we did meet. How is he?\N- Fine, I think. - Can you just hold on for a sec?\N- Sure. - Okay. Hi, sorry. That was Amanda.\N- How'd she sound? - How is she doing?\N- She just asked me how you are. - And what did you say?\N- I asked her to hold. - Can I call you back?\N- I can hold while you speak to her. - Really?\N- Find out how she is. Okay. My brother wants to know\Nhow you are. Can you tell him I'm good and that\NI'm just walking Charlie in the village. - What's he been up to? Did he say?\N- I'm not sure. - Do you want me to ask him?\N- Sure. Okay. Hold, please. I can't believe that you have had sex\Nwith the woman staying in my house! He told you that? - Oh, my God!\N- Oh, my God! Oh, my God. I thought I was talking\Nto Graham! Can you just hold, please? I'm terribly sorry. I can't believe you\Nhad sex with Amanda! The one thing she asked me was,\N"Are there any men in your town?" I assured her that there were not. Then you meet her and immediately\Nget into her knickers! Still me. Bollocks! I must have lost him. Amanda, I am so sorry. Can I call you back? - Sure.\N- Okay, bye. Yes, hello. It's Miles. Am I in trouble? Oh, Miles. Hi. What are you up to\Nthis Christmas Eve? Not much. But in a little bit... ...I'm gonna go to the video shop\Nand get the next movie on Arthur's list. Do you want some company? Love some. Hey, I got you the best drink\Nin town, but I didn't know... ...if you liked a little dollop\Nof whipped cream or a big one... ...so I got both and you can have\Neach one... Hello, big dollop! - Say, you look great, by the way.\N- Thanks. - Really great.\N- Thanks, I'm feeling good. I've been working out with Arthur. - What?\N- No. I'm sure it's an awesome workout.\NI'm sorry. I'm trying not to picture it. Okay, well, the workout's\Nnot that great, but the conver... Stop laughing! - The conversation is truly fantastic.\N- No, that I totally believe. Now let me ask you.\NHave you seen this? Chariots of Fire. Loved it. Such a great score by vangelis. He took electronic scores to a new\Nlevel. It was groundbreaking. I'm gonna test you on this later.\NOkay. Driving Miss Daisy. Hans. Very unexpected.\NDo you remember how great it was? Sassy! Love it. - Is this a bad game?\N- No! - Okay.\N- Keep going. Sometimes I get self-conscious\Nabout my... And: Are you embarrassed\NBy this game I've start. Ed to play? Okay. It's not a library.\NI can go loud. Two notes and you've got a villain. I don't know what to say about it.\NTotally brill. I bet you didn't know that was all\Nwritten for the movie. It was a score. - I did know that one.\N- Can't go anywhere. Oh, my God. Okay, this one?\NYou have to check this out some time. The Mission.\NThe score is genius. It just comes from\Na totally different place. It's like... I can't even... Just promise me\Nyou'll rent it and listen to it. - Renting.\N- Thank you. It changed my world. What? Maggie! - Why do I always fall for the bad girl?\N- You didn't know she was a bad girl. I knew she wasn't good. Do you have anything\Na little bit stronger? Thank you. Let me rephrase this: Why am I attracted to a person\NI know isn't good? I happen to know the answer to this.\NYou're hoping you're wrong. She does something that tells you\Nshe's no good, you ignore it. Every time she comes through and\Nsurprises you, she wins you over... ...and you lose that argument\Nwith yourself that she's not for you. Exactly. And on top of that,\Nthere's the old standby: "I can't believe a girl like that\Nwould be with a guy like me." You know what she said\Nto me tonight? She finished in Santa Fe\Nafter two days... ...and has been staying with\Nwhatever-his-name-was. Which means she's been\Nright here in town. When I spoke to her this morning\Non her cell and she said: "I'm looking out my window\Nand it's snowing." She was in Santa Monica. What did she do,\Ngo to Weather. Com? That must have made them\Nscream with laughter. And in the meantime, I sent her\NChristmas gift to Santa Fe yesterday. I stood in line at FedEx\Nto make sure she got it on time. Classic, right? I don't wanna ruin your Christmas Eve.\NYou don't have to listen to this. It's okay. I like the company. So how about some food? Shall I make us\Na little Christmas fettuccine? - Sure.\N- Listen. I know it's hard to believe people\Nwhen they say, "I know how you feel." But I actually know how you feel. You see... ...I was... ...seeing someone back in London. We worked for\Nthe same newspaper. And then I found out that he was\Nalso seeing this other girl, Sarah... ...from the Circulation Department\Non the 19th floor. It turned out that he wasn't\Nin love with me like I thought. What I'm trying to say is... ...I understand feeling\Nas small and as insignificant... ...as humanly possible. How it can actually ache in places that\Nyou didn't know you had inside you. It doesn't matter how many\Nnew haircuts you get... ...or gyms you join... ...or how many glasses of chardonnay\Nyou drink with girlfriends. You still go to bed every night\Ngoing over every detail... ...and wonder what you did wrong\Nor how you could have misunderstood. And how in the hell,\Nfor that brief moment... ...you could think that you were\Nthat happy? And sometimes you can\Neven convince yourself... ...that he'll see the light\Nand show up at your door. And after all that... ...however long "all that" may be... ...you'll go somewhere new. And you'll meet people who make you\Nfeel worthwhile again. And little pieces of your soul\Nwill finally come back. And all that fuzzy stuff... ...those years of your life\Nthat you wasted... ...that will eventually begin to fade. Well, fuck. You need this more than I do. That's what you're doing here?\NYou're getting over somebody? Yeah. This is me in good shape. Is this the guy who sent you pages\Nfrom his novel? Yeah. He needs me. So he stays in touch? All the time. That makes it impossible to forget,\Nwhich is great for him, sucks for you. You see how great your life is\Ncompared to mine? Okay, let's go.\NI'm making you some fettuccine. It is Christmas Eve, and we\Nare going to sit out on that patio... ...gonna make ourselves a little fire,\Npop some bubbly... ...and we are gonna celebrate\Nbeing young and being alive. You with me, Simpkins? Miles. You really are\Nan incredibly decent man. I know. That's always been my problem. Hi. Okay, here it is. Arthur's theme.\NI think this is really good. - I'm serious.\N- No, I know. I'm making him a CD of this tune.\NEvery time he hears it... ...it should give him the confidence\Nto walk right out there. - Okay?\N- Yep. Here we go. Did I steal this? - John Williams.\N- I didn't write it, that's why. - Okay, this is it for real.\N- Okay. - Here we go.\N- Yep. A little Arthur and the knights. Right? It's cheeky. It sounds like him. I also wrote one\Nthat sounds like you. You did? Iris, if you were a melody. I used only the good notes. Iris lives next door To Art. Hur\NHe's a doodle-ee-doo - And also a doodle-ee-doo\N- Scroodle-ee-doo - A scroodle-ee-doo? I didn't know that.\N- Yeah. - And froodle-ee-doo\N- And froodle-ee-doo We both said "froodle-ee." I'm impressed. You are a prodigy. A "doodle" prodigy. Swoodle-ee-doo So you're totally great. Yeah. This is a bitch. Well, you must come to London\Nall the time for work, right? London? Never. New York? Not really, but that's easier.\NDo you go there often? Rarely. Long-distance relationships\Ncan work. Really? I can't make one work... ...when I live in the same house\Nwith someone. So this could be\Na good solution for you. Oh, man. Okay. Let's say we just make this happen. We commit to flying back and forth\Nas much as we can. Yes! It's doable, definitely. And then let's say\Nin six months we hit a wall. Like, I can't constantly\Nbe away from work... ...or the girls can't deal with you\Nleaving so often. And we start to feel the tension.\NWe know this isn't gonna work... ...so we start fighting because\Nwe don't know what else to do. And then, after a long, tearful... At your end... phone call... ...we just... We say goodbye.\N- Thank you. That'll be it, for real. It's not like\Nwe'll ever bump into each other. And then what's left?\NTwo miserable people... ...feeling totally mashed up\Nand hurt. Or... Thank you. Or maybe we should just... ...realize that what we've had these\Npast few weeks has been perfect. And maybe it won't\Nget any better than this. Maybe we're trying to figure\Nthis thing out... ...because it makes us\Nfeel good to feel this. Maybe the fact\Nthat I'm leaving in 8 hours... ...makes this far more exciting\Nthan it might actually be. Maybe. You are, seriously,\Nthe most depressing girl I've ever met. I know. I have another scenario for you. - Good.\N- I'm in love with you. I apologize for the blunt delivery. But as problematical as this... ...fact may be, I am in love. With you. I'm not feeling this\Nbecause you're leaving. And not because it feels good\Nto feel this way. Which, by the way, it does...\NOr did, before you went off like that. I can't figure out\Nthe mathematics of this. I just know I love you. Can't believe how many times\NI'm saying it. And I never thought I'd feel this way\Nagain, so that's pretty phenomenal. And I realize I come\Nwith a package deal: Three for the price of one. And my... ...package, perhaps in the light of day,\Nisn't all that wonderful... ...but I finally know what I want,\Nand that, in itself, is a miracle. And what I want... ...is you. I wasn't expecting "I love you." Can you not look at me like that? I'm trying to find\Nthe right thing to say. I think if the obvious response... ...doesn't immediately\Ncome to you, we can... ...just... We should just... ...talk about something else. Like, possibly,\Nwhat a complete ass I am. I do recall you promising me\Nyou wouldn't fall in love with me. Must pay better attention. I've never met a guy\Nwho talks as much as me. But could you just for now... ...be quiet? Please? How many of his movies\Nare on that list of his? About 15. I love it. I don't know how I've never seen\NThe Lady Eve before. Barbara Stanwyck is dazzling. - And she's so sure of herself.\N- And sexy. Really sexy! You know,\Nevery movie he's told me to see... ...has this powerhouse woman in it.\N- Wonder if he's trying... ...to tell you something with that.\NOkay, sorry about that. Boob graze. That was accidental.\NAccidental boob graze. I'm sorry. - Changing subject.\N- Okay. Arthur has requested... ...that you write some lyrics\Nfor his theme song. What's the matter? Who is it? It's Maggie. Hello? Hi. I'm doing okay. Actually, Maggie,\NI'm a bit tied up at the moment. I don't know.\NWhat time could you be there? All right, I'll be there. Oh, no, no. Like, a half-hour. Maybe a little longer. Okay, bye. She misses me. You see? She came to her senses. - We should get the bill.\N- No! No, no, take your time.\NI can wait till you're finished. - I'm finished.\N- No. - You didn't get to your spicy tuna yet.\N- I'm fine, really. You can go. I can get this one. I'll see you later at the Writers Guild.\NI mean, if you can still make it. I gotta get all the way to Silver Lake,\Nbut I'm gonna try to be there. Anyway, I'm bringing the music.\NI mean, I really wanna be there... ...but I don't know how long\Nthis is gonna take. I'm sorry. It's all good. Don't worry. - Good luck.\N- Thank you. Hello. Oh, Jasper! I'm just reading\Nyour pages. No, I hadn't forgotten.\NI've just been busy, that's all. That's not true. I was gonna call you\Nwhen I'd read... What kind of surprise? No, I don't see a box or anything. Yes, I'm sure. Hold on, let me just check\Nthe kitchen. No, not in there. Well, I'll go and check the gate. Yes. Well, when did you send it? I found your Christmas present. This place suits you. Yeah, right. No, really. So you are eventually\Ngonna look at me, aren't you? Hello. I came here\Nbecause I had to see you. Had to. Oh, Jasper, I really don't\Nunderstand this. I mean... I was right there for three years!\NRemember? Square peg, round hole? - What?\N- That's what you said. That we weren't really right\Nfor each other. We were a square peg\Nand a round hole. I don't remember that. I just know\NI hated when you were gone. And also, I have never checked\Nmy e-mails more. It was driving me crazy\Nthat I wasn't hearing from you. I don't want to lose you, babe. Lose me? This is too confusing. Come here. I screwed up.\NMiles, haven't you ever screwed up? I made a mistake. I was stupid and impulsive. He wasn't what I thought.\NI just started thinking about you... ...and wishing and hoping\Nthat you would just forgive me. Will you, Miles? Will you forgive me? You know what I was thinking? When you get back to London... ...maybe we could sneak off\Nsomewhere together. Maybe venice. You and me in venice\Ncould be good. Do you mean that? I mean... Are you free to do that? Darling... ...I've just traveled halfway across\Nthe world to see you, haven't I? Yeah, that doesn't exactly\Nanswer my question, so... Are you not with\NSarah anymore? I mean... ...is that what you've come here\Nto tell me? I wish you could just accept knowing\Nhow confused I am about all this. Okay, let me translate that. So you are still engaged\Nto be married. - Yes, but, I mean...\N- Oh, my God. Okay, this was a really... ...close call. You know, I never thought\NI'd say this, literally never... ...but I think you were\Nabsolutely right about us. Very square peg, very round hole! - You cannot mean that.\N- The great thing is I actually do. And I'm about three years late\Nin telling you this... ...but nevertheless I need to say it. Jasper... Wait. I need the lights on. Jasper... ...you have never treated me right. - Ever.\N- Oh, babe. You broke my heart. And you acted like\Nsomehow it was my fault... ...my misunderstanding,\Nand I was too in love with you... ...to ever be mad at you, so I just\Npunished myself! For years! But you waltzing in here\Non my lovely Christmas holiday... ...and telling me that\Nyou don't want to lose me... ...whilst you're\Nabout to get married... ...somehow newly entitles me\Nto say... ...it's over. This... This twisted,\Ntoxic thing between us... ...is finally finished! I'm miraculously done\Nbeing in love with you! I've got a life to start living. - And you're not going to be in it.\N- Darling... Now I've got somewhere\Nreally important to be... ...and you have\Ngot to get the hell out. - Now!\N- What exactly has got into you? I don't know. But I think what I've got\Nis something slightly resembling... ...gumption. Iris... ...you're a knockout. Thank you. - And may I say, so are you.\N- Did I do my tie okay? I haven't worn one in 15 years. - It's perfect.\N- I like this Hugo Boss. He cuts a nice suit. I've got something for you. Forgive me. The last time\NI had a date, this is what we did. It's beautiful. If it's corny, or if it's\Ngoing to ruin your outfit... ...you don't have to wear it. I like corny. I'm looking for corny in my life. - That's a nice line.\N- It's all those movies! Okay, let's do it. Let's get this embarrassment\Nover with. Okay. - Mr. Abbott?\N- Yes, sir. We're all ready for you. Ladies and gentlemen,\NMr. Arthur Abbott! - Oh, hi!\N- Arthur, you made it. Thank you. Thank you too. Thank you very much. I'll take you up, Mr. Abbott. Go on, go for it. I'll do it. The man is a rock star. Hi! Sorry I'm late. The Maggie thing\Ntook a little time, but it is over. Finished, kaput. You look beautiful. Thank you. Thanks. Thank you, thank you. I'm... I'm absolutely overwhelmed... ...that I could climb those stairs. He did great. I came to Hollywood\Nover 60 years ago... ...and immediately fell in love\Nwith motion pictures. And it's a love affair\Nthat's lasted a lifetime. When I first arrived in Tinseltown... ...there were no cineplexes\Nor multiplexes. No such thing as a\NBlockbuster or DvD. I was here before conglomerates\Nowned the studios. Before pictures\Nhad special effects teams. And definitely before box office\Nresults were reported... ...like baseball scores\Non the nightly news. He is so fantastic. - Iris?\N- Yes? What are you doing\NNew Year's Eve? I'll be back in England\Nby New Year's Eve. You know, I've never been\Nto England. - I've never been to Europe.\N- No? If I come over there, will you go out\Nwith me on New Year's Eve? Love to. We're not gonna make a bigger deal\Nout of this than it already is. No, we're not. It's not like we're never\Ngoing to speak or e-mail or... - No set rules.\N- None. So now I'm just gonna\Nkiss you for the millionth time... ...and say, "Be seeing you." Be seeing you. Take care of yourself. Did you have a good holiday, miss? Yeah. Great. Maybe the best ever. Amanda Woods... ...welcome back. Turn around! Turn around and go back, please! - Did you forget something?\N- Yes! Yes. Can you go any faster? This lane's tricky.\NIt's gonna take a bit. It's okay, just stop. Madam? Madam! Graham? Graham. You know... ...I was just thinking... ...why would I ever leave\Nbefore New Year's Eve? That makes no sense at all. I mean, you didn't exactly\Nask me out... ...but you did say you loved me... ...so I'm thinking I've got a date. If you'll have me. I have the girls New Year's Eve. Sounds perfect. I'm coming to get you! You look just like an angel\Non the top of the Christmas tree. You got so big. Give us a kiss. Come and tell me all about\Nyour Christmas presents. Go sit with Miles. Sweetie. - I challenge ye.\N- Me? The love train\Nis leaving the station. - Happy New Year!\N- Happy New Year! Happy New Year! Happy New Year, everybody!
