Alex, this way! Come on! Hurry. Get in and don't come out. Daniel, I'm scared. Shh. Daniel, please.\NThey're trying to kill me. Please help me.\NDaniel, please. He's in here. No, no, no! God, no! No, Charles! Stop! - Helene!\N- No, please, stop it! No! Charles! No. No. Charles. No, please. Please, stop. Please. No. You don't have to do this. Daniel, I'm so proud of you. Please, listen to... You don't have to do this.\NNothing's gonna happen. Helene! Helene,\Nplease just talk to them. Helene! Please, no! No! No, please! No! <i>To have and to hold.</i> <i>From this day forward.</i> For better, for worse. For richer, for poorer. In sickness, and in health. Till death do us part. And even though your family\Nis richer than God, intimidates\Nthe hell out of me... your dad definitely hates me, and your alcoholic brother\Nkeeps hitting on me... I honestly can't wait to be a part\Nof your moderately fucked-up family. "Moderately"?\NThat's pretty generous. - Hi.\N- Hey. Holy shit! You look perfect. What're you doing? You smoking? In my old room? Give me that. We should get down there. Your dad looks\Nlike he's at a funeral. - He hates me.\N- No. He doesn't hate you, Grace. He thinks\NI'm after your money. Well, I mean, that's true.\NYeah. - You just gotta give it time...\N- So mean! What? No, it's true. Honey, just give it time.\NOkay? - Okay.\N- Okay? We sprung this on them. - Yeah.\N- They're used to a three-year courtship. And not what we did. The, I don't know,\N18-month... Bone-a-thon. "Bone-a-thon"? Okay. Yeah. - We should put that in the vows.\N- I did. - Oh, good.\N- Mm-hmm. Anyway, who cares what they think?\NThey're horrible people. Well, I-I care what they think. Because they are the family\Nof the man that I love. And I want them to accept me. Are you okay? 'Cause I'm\Nnervous enough as it is. No, it's not that. I just... Without you, I'm... - One of us.\N- Hey. - Daniel.\N- I've been sent to fetch you. <i>♪ Here comes the groom\Nshitting his pants ♪</i> <i>♪ He cannot believe ♪</i> - <i>♪ That his entire life is over ♪</i>\N- Daniel, you fuck. Stop it. I'm gonna let you go\Nin three, two... release. Take it easy. It's not too late to flee,\Nyou know. You don't belong\Nin this family. I mean that\Nas a compliment. Okay. Well, if you're still\Ndetermined to be a Le Domas, then would you please\Nget yourselves outside. Okay? Congratulations, you fuckface. Thank you. I can't believe\Nthat in half an hour... I will be a part of\Nthe Le Domas gaming... dynasty? Empire? "Dominion."\NWe prefer "dominion." - "Dominion."\N- Yeah. But... Um... You know, Daniel's right. We could just... leave. Oh, sure, yeah. "Thanks for the presents.\NGo fuck yourselves." No. I'm serious, I'm serious, honey. I'm giving you an out. Right now. No, thank you.\NI'm all the way in. Are you ready for this? Oh, fuck no. Smile, please. He could've\Ndone so much better. You're just saying that\Nbecause he's your favorite. Oh, please.\NI love all of you... equally. Two years\Nis a long time, Alex. I started to think\Nwe'd really lost you. Smile. Smile, please. The more natural the better. Okay, that's good. Don't take it personally. They're just trying to figure out\Nif you're a gold-digging whore. You know, like my wife. To the left. She's pretty enough, in a "last call at\Nthe dive bar" kinda way. But she'll never be one of us. Of course not, dear. She has a soul. Where the hell's your sister? I'm sure it's Fitch's fault. He's useless.\NBut he's one of us. Is Grace? There you are. Hi! Hi. - Give me a hand.\N- Oh. Okay. It's a beautiful case, wow. Thank you. It was my mother's. Do you smoke? Oh, no. Nervous? Ah. Because your blood\Nisn't blue enough? They said\Nthe same thing about me. They did? Stand tall and fuck 'em. The only thing that matters\Nis what Alex thinks. And that we know. - I love you.\N- I love you. I have something? Oh, shit. Shh. Do you remember\Nanything that happened today? It's a goddamn blur. - But I'm pretty sure...\N- Yeah. - Did we get married?\N- We got married. Are you my wife? - Holy shit. Holy fucking shit.\N- Yes. You're my husband! Oh, my God. Shit. Oh, babe. - Babe.\N- Hey. It's hard with this thing. - I know. Listen.\N- Hold me. - I have to tell you something...\N- Mm-mm. Shut up.\NTake your pants off. No, I have to tell you\Nsomething. - Grace, honey.\N- I'm taking 'em off. Holy shit! Holy shit.\NSomeone's here. What? Jesus, Aunt Helene!\NCan you give us a minute? You'll have to hide\Nbetter than that. We're not fucking hiding,\Nobviously. Everyone is waiting. Yeah, we'll be down\Nin a few minutes. - I'm sorry, honey.\N- What the hell was that? That's my aunt Helene. She has, um...\Nwell, she has boundary issues. Yeah. Of course\Nyou have a secret door. It's a servant's corridor. They run\Nall through the house. Um, sorry, who's waiting? That's what I was trying\Nto tell you. Um... So, at midnight\Nyou have to play a game. It's just something we do when\Nsomeone new joins the family. - A game?\N- Yeah. What game? I don't know.\NUh, you draw a card. Could be backgammon, croquet,\Ncheckers, for all I know. I know. I know. It's stupid. It's a little weird. Why, exactly? I guess, because we made our money in\Ngames, it's part of the initiation. - Do I have to win?\N- No. You just... you just have to play. - And then...\N- And then you... you are officially\Npart of the family. Honestly, it means more to\Nthem than the wedding itself. - That's it?\N- Yeah, that's it. I know it's ridiculous. It's just a weird\Nfamily ritual. And we only have to\Ndo it once. All right? Okay. - Yeah.\N- Okay. If it gets your family\Nto accept me, I will play the shit out...\Nof checkers. - I'm really good at it.\N- Okay. Okay. You go buy me ten minutes\N'cause I gotta put on... my game face. - I see what you did there. Very good.\N- Right. Okay. So, uh, I'll meet you\Ndownstairs. Music room. Ah. Yes. A totally normal room\Nto have in a house. Just... It is just downstairs.\NIt's your second door on the right. Okay. <i>I thought\NI might find you here.</i> I'm sure Mr. Le Bail\Nis with us today. <i>So, how much\Nhave you told her?</i> <i>Nothing.\NAnd I never will.</i> <i>Tomorrow we're gone.</i> <i>If she pulls that card,</i> <i>are you prepared\Nto do what's necessary?</i> Excuse me, whatever you wanna\Nsay, get on with it please. You better hurry your ass\Nup and get here before midnight. Call me when\Nyou get this message. Dora, two more, please. - Grace, darling.\N- Hi. - Your vows were beautiful.\N- Oh. Thank you. Alex didn't tell us you were\Nbrought up in foster homes. Not that he tells us anything\Nthese days. Champagne? Oh. Thank you. Thanks. My foster parents\Nwere great people. And, you know,\Nthey did what they could. But it was always temporary. I always sort of dreamed\Nof having a... a family. I mean, I'm sure Alex would've\Nloved living in sin forever. I don't doubt it. But he, um, he really understood\Nhow important it was for me to... finally have a real,\Npermanent family. And I just don't\Nwanna let you down. Grace. When I first saw you,\NI said to Tony: "Finally. One of our children\Nhas brought home a good one." And you don't know how grateful we\Nare that you brought Alex back to us. But please... try to bring him back\Ninto the fold. We're his family. I promise. Oh, sweetheart. I knew you would. Oh! - Hey.\N- Hi! Mom, I'm just gonna\Nsteal her away. Okay? Mmm. - Hi.\N- Hi. What'd she say to you? Oh, she's so sweet. Did she say anything? No. No. All right. Are you okay?\NDid something happen? Yeah, no. I just,\NI don't feel very well. Well, if you wanna lie down,\Ncan't we just play the game tomorrow? - No, no, it has to be tonight.\N- Hands up! - Kill, kill, kill! Kill, kill, kill!\N- No! No! - Hey!\N- Get him, Georgie! Whoo!\NWe made it, Daddy. Take it off, now! - Daddy?\N- You just keep on playing there, buddy. Oh, you're so tense. - Le Bail's gonna get you.\N- Asshole. - Kill, kill!\N- Mr. Le Bail! You. Lady in white. Look at this, you must be the bride. - Hi.\N- Fitch Bradley. Grace. Pleasure. - Alex.\N- Hi, Fitch. How are you? Well done.\NSorry we cut it so close. We couldn't get our regular charter\Nout of de Gaulle this morning. And I cannot fly\Ncommercial anymore, right? - It's the worst. You understand.\N- Grace! Hi! - Hi!\N- I'm Emilie. Oh, my God,\Nyour dress is amazing! I've been totally\Nstalking you on Instagram. Oh, really? That's... We're gonna be best friends. Hi. Nice to see you. I'm so excited to be\Na part of your family. Me too, me too! He will decide that, my dear. Aunt Helene.\NIt's nice to see you. Brown-haired niece. You continue to exist. Ladies and gentlemen,\Nit is 11:55. This is gonna blow your mind. Oh, okay. So this room is reserved\Nfor family members only. After you, my dear. Holy shit. Great-Grandfather\Nenjoyed his games. Grace. Have a seat. Do you like to play games? Um, I guess it depends on\Nwhat we're playing. Well, we'll know in a moment. I gather you've noticed our\Nfamily is big on tradition. And now, well, now the time has come\Nfor you to join us in those traditions. Ooh. Story time. As you may know,\Nmy great-grandfather, Victor, set up a modest printing shop\Nduring the Civil War, manufacturing playing cards. A generation later, my grandfather expanded into\Nsporting goods and board games. Under my leadership, Le Domas Family Games\Nacquired four professional sports teams and reached,\Nwell, even greater heights. Some may call it luck, but, well,\Nit's a little more than that. You know, it's almost as if\Nsomeone's watching over us. It all began with\Na very generous benefactor. And this box. You see, originally,\NGreat-Grandfather was a merchant seaman. It was a hard life. And, like so many,\Nhe wanted more. On one of his\Nmany excursions abroad, Great-Grandfather\Ncame to meet a Mr. Le Bail. He was a... He was\Na passenger aboard the ship. A collector, of sorts. Purchasing exotic antiquities\Nto resell to wealthy Americans. After discovering a mutual\Npassion for games of chance, they passed a great many hours\Nplaying cards. And among Mr. Le Bail's\Npossessions was... that box. And one evening,\Nafter indulging in more than their fair ration of rum... Mr. Le Bail\Nproposed a wager. If Great-Grandfather could\Nsolve the mystery of the box before arriving at port, Mr. Le Bail would finance any\Nendeavor of Grandfather's choosing. Well... Great-Grandfather whiled away the\Nlong hours at sea studying the box. Until finally... And since that time... whenever the Le Domases are presented\Nwith a new addition to the family... we place a blank\Nplaying card into the box. Our initiate then has the\Nprivilege of drawing the card, and Mr. Le Bail will tell us\Nwhich game to play. I got chess. I got Old Maid. Seriously,\Nwhat the fuck is Old Maid? Fitch... So I just take out the card? My dear, it is your turn. What does it say, girl? Oh. It says... It says, "hide and seek." Are we really gonna play that? Everything okay? Uh... Yeah. Yeah.\NThose are the rules. Hide and seek, right, Dad? Yes, indeed. Those are the rules. Okay, so, uh, who...\Nwho hides and who seeks? Well, it's your initiation,\Nmy dear. You get to be the one\Nto, uh, to hide. Of course. This is gonna be fun, honey.\NYeah, just come meet me in my room, okay? - No, I wanna play for real. This is so weird.\N- No, no. I know. Um, so, to Mister... Le Bail. To Mr. Le Bail. - To Mr. Le Bail.\N- To Mr. Le Bail. <i>The rules are simple.</i> You can hide\Nanywhere inside the house. We then count to 100 and\Ntry to, um... well, find you. Well, don't you think you have\Na little bit of an advantage? Oh. No, no.\NWe never use the cameras. <i>We always play the games as they would've\Nbeen played in Great-Grandfather's time.</i> <i>Always.</i> So, there's no way\Nfor me to win, right? Well, you could, I mean,\Nstay hidden till dawn. - No, thank you.\N- No. <i>We're gonna start the count</i> just as soon\Nas you leave, okay? Okay. Grace, good luck. <i>Who wants to play a game?</i> <i>It's time for hide and seek.</i> <i>♪ Run, run, run ♪</i> <i>♪ Time to run and hide ♪</i> - <i>♪ Run, run, run ♪</i>\N- "Here we may reign secure... - <i>♪ And now I'm going to find you ♪</i>\N- ...and in my choice ...to reign\Nis worth ambition..." <i>♪ Hurry, I'm behind you ♪</i> <i>♪ Don't you speak ♪</i> <i>♪ Hide and seek ♪</i> <i>♪ Tiptoe to the cellar\Nor crawl under your bed ♪</i> <i>♪ Anywhere you've fled ♪</i> <i>♪ I am going to find you ♪</i> <i>♪ Stay inside the shadows ♪</i> <i>♪ All you girls and boys ♪</i> <i>♪ Don't you make a noise ♪</i> <i>♪ Or I am going to find you ♪</i> <i>♪ Run, run, run ♪</i> <i>♪ Creep up on my prey ♪</i> <i>♪ Run, run, run ♪</i> <i>♪ Stalk the night away ♪</i> <i>♪ You can scuttle off\Ninto the night ♪</i> <i>♪ But what will be\Nbehind you ♪</i> <i>♪ Don't you speak ♪</i> <i>♪ Hide and seek ♪</i> <i>♪ Like the frog\Ninside a skillet ♪</i> <i>♪ The lobster in a pan ♪</i> <i>♪ You don't understand\Nthat I am going to find you ♪</i> <i>♪ Be still as a mountain ♪</i> <i>♪ And quiet as a mouse ♪</i> Tony, what the hell is this?\NHow old is this thing? <i>♪ And I will surely find you ♪</i> <i>♪ Tick, tick, tock ♪</i> <i>♪ Are you ready or not ♪</i> <i>♪ Tick, tick, tock ♪</i> <i>♪ Listen to the clock ♪</i> <i>♪ Hasten off into the black ♪</i> <i>♪ Don't waste\Nanother heartbeat ♪</i> <i>♪ Don't you peek ♪</i> <i>♪ Hide and seek ♪</i> <i>Let the countdown begin.</i> <i>♪ Ten, nine, eight ♪</i> <i>♪ even, six, five ♪</i> <i>♪ Four, three, two, one ♪</i> <i>Ready or not, here I come.</i> Sweetheart, maybe\Nyou should just stay here.

How long is this gonna take? How long\Ndoes this usually take? There is nothing usual\Nabout this. It's only happened once\Nsince I joined the family. Am I really supposed to know\Nhow to use this thing? Oh, you know what? I'm just gonna\Nmake a quick pit stop. I've got a nervous stomach. You know I've never\Nliked you, right? Uh... All right. That's enough of this. Shit. Shit. Oh, shit. Georgie. Georgie. Shh. - I'm sorry. I'm sorry.\N- Jesus. - I nearly pissed myself.\N- I know. - You need to listen to me very carefully.\N- Georgie. - Shit. Come with me.\N- Wait. What are we doing? - Get down. Grab your dress, grab your dress.\N- Okay. Jesus. Georgie,\NI know you're in here. Georg... Over here!\NOver here, over here! Guys, I found her! I did it! Dad! Daddy, I did it! Look! Daddy, come see what I mean... Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit. Oh, Jesus Christ. This is Clara. Does she look\Nlike she's wearing a giant, white\Nwedding dress, Emilie? Why did you shoot her in the\Nface, sweetheart? You're supposed to maim her.\NShe needs to be alive for the ritual. I don't know. - I heard a shot.\N- Yeah. Oh. Well, if she dies,\Ndoes this count? Of course it does not count.\NIt must be the bride. Well, what do we do now? Well, I don't know.\NI'm... I'm thinking. Clara, hey. It's gonna be okay. Oh, Daniel, could you? Come on, let's take a walk. She's gonna die, guys. Walk it off. So, what do we do with her? Move her.\NWe don't want Grace to see. Give me the fucking lanterns. Okay. Call it. - Heads.\N- Heads it is. - You get the legs.\N- Okay. Hold on. It's slipping. Yeah, good.\NOh, good. Okay. Go. She was my favorite. Wait here. Don't move. Okay, sweetie, you gotta get up.\NWe gotta get you out of here right now. Okay. Stand up, here we go. Okay. Okay, grab...\Ngrab your phone. Grab the keys. Fuck. Shit. Okay. Stevens must've\Ntaken the phone, so... - Alex, what the fuck?\N- You're gonna have to run, okay? Hide and seek.\NYou pulled the one bad card. They think... They think they\Nhave to kill you before sunrise. - What the fuck?\N- Follow me. One sec! I forgot my gun. Okay. Okay, girl, no more fuckups. - You're a winner.\N- You got that? - Okay, you have your shoes?\N- Alex. Honey, I need you\Nto put on your shoes. No, Alex, Alex,\Nwhat the fuck is going on? I need you to put\Nyour shoes on. Right now. Okay, here we go. Here we go. Okay. They think that\Nif they don't kill you, something very bad\Nwill happen to the family. Now... I had to play along\Nso that I can get you out. But the house is on lock down right\Nnow, so it's gonna be really tricky. You knew what would happen\Nif I pulled that card. - I didn't think they'd actually go through with it.\N- Fucking knew! No one ever pulls that.\NIt never fucking happens. - Yeah, but you knew about it!\N- No, no, I didn't. - <i>I'm Richard Babis.</i>\N- <i>And I'm Charlie.</i> <i>And today's segment is called</i> <i>"Getting to know\Nyour crossbow."</i> Oh, fuck. I really...\NI thought it was safe. But if I didn't\Npull a card at all, then... Then your crazy family\Nwouldn't be trying to... - Oh, my God, they're gonna kill me.\N- No, then we'd both be dead. When you marry into this\Nfamily you have to play a game. And if you don't, you die. I know that sounds crazy,\Nbut you have to believe me, it is real. It happened to my great-uncle. He got married, he didn't play a\Ngame, next morning he died. His wife too. Same thing\Nhappened to my cousin Rachel. Same thing happened to a bunch of people\Nthat I never even met before. You just... You have to play. You said your family\Nwas... fucked-up, - but you didn't say psycho killers.\N- I know. - You... you brought me here, you didn't warn me.\N- You wanted to get married. - So it's my fucking fault?\N- No. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. - Are you fucking serious?\N- Shh. - We could've eloped.\N- I know. - We could've...\N- No, no. There are rules. You can't just elope. You... you have to have\Nthe wedding here, and you have to play\Nthe fucking game. You didn't even fucking talk to me.\NYou could've told me. We could've... - Just...\N- If I told you, you would've left. And if I didn't propose,\Nyou would've left. You're everything to me,\Nand I promise you I'm gonna get you\Nout of here, okay? All right?\NSo just listen to me. You just need to go straight down this hallway until\Nyou get to the service kitchen. I'm gonna go down\Nto the security room. I'm gonna unlock all the doors.\NI'm gonna unlock all the doors. - No. Don't fucking leave me.\N- Then you just fucking run. I have to. Honey, I have to. Just... just stay inside the\Nwalls until you get to the kit... Hey. Hey. You can do this.\NWhere you going? Straight\Nand then, um, kitchen. To the kitchen.\NGood. Good. Hey. Hey. You're gonna make it.\NIt's gonna be okay. - I love you.\N- I love you. Go. Go. Okay. Fuck. Okay. Fuck. Oh, hey. Any sign of her? No. She could be anywhere. Found her. Jesus! Fuck! Goddammit! Emilie, aim for\Nthe center of gravity! I don't know what I'm doing! Help, help, help, help. Fuck. Shh. I just came to get a drink. I have to call the others. No, you don't. No. You can help me. Please. This doesn't end well for you. I just don't wanna be\Nthe one to serve you up. Daniel, I'm begging you. I'm really sorry\Nabout all this. It's true what they say:\NThe rich really are different. I'll give you\Na ten-second head start. Daniel. One, one thousand. Two, one thousand. <i>Two and a half, one thousand.</i> She's in the study! <i>Point\Nthe weapon away from you.</i> You lost her? Indeed. You're pathetic. Indeed. Could you at least\Npretend to care? Oh, I'm sure you'll find her and\Nkill her with or without my help. You know, something did\Noccur to me, though. Alex may have been wrong\Nto keep Grace in the dark... but do you remember\Nhow you reacted when I told you about this? You didn't fucking blink. I mean, you couldn't wait\Nto sign your soul away. You know where I came from and what my life\Nwas like before. I'd rather be dead\Nthan lose all of this. Well... from your lips. - Where is she?\N- I'm afraid you just missed her. Tony, Alex got out.\NI'm so sorry. Goddammit. Who's the fuckup now, right? Still me? Did you find her? Is it over? No, it's not over. And now she knows\Nwhat's going on. Oh, but Emilie shot Clara\Nin the face. So she's dead.\NThat's just a side note. Clara's dead? She was my favorite. Cock! I forgot my gun. Daddy, I forgot my gun.\NI suck. - Oh, it's okay.\N- I suck! You don't suck, sweetheart. Here, hon, why don't you\Njust use mine. Mr. Le Domas, Mr. Le Domas,\NI just saw her running... - Oh, my God!\N- Oh, my God. - Okay, now...\N- Why does this always happen to me? - Come on!\N- Okay. Calm down. Baby. - Yeah, okay, that's okay, honey. Come on.\N- Don't be mad. Let's go take a walk, find you an\Nedible, even you out a little bit. Maybe we'll find the other one that's\Nstill alive to clean that shit up. So, wait. Does the help count? No! Why does everyone\Nkeep asking that? We must... We must... Oh, what the fuck! We must kill the bride\Nby dawn. We're fucked.\NI mean, we are so fucked. Calm down. Work the problem. We should use\Nthe security cameras. You have no respect\Nfor tradition. No, she's right. Don't you think\NGreat-Grandfather would've used the security\Ncameras if he had them? I mean, it's not tradition that\Nhe was born before cameras. That's... that's stupid. Exactly. Times change. Speaking of which, may I please\Nuse a weapon made this century? - I have a gun in my purse.\N- You do? No. No. We use Great-Grandfather's.\NThat's tradition. You pick and choose.\NPick and choose. At least you're not making us\Nwear those fucking masks. Oh, no. That was Dad's idea. It was the '80s. - Our reverence must not wane.\N- Goddammit, Sis! If we don't find her and perform the\Nritual before dawn, we're all dead. Tony,\Ntake Daniel and turn on the cameras. Everyone else fan out,\Nand somebody find Alex. Jesus. Fucking shit. Fuck. Come on, Alex. Monitors. Monitors. Okay. Oh, shit. Shit, shit, shit, shit. Your aunt always\Ngets lost in the details. Who gives a shit\Nhow we find her? Oh. I agree completely. Yeah. - Looks like we're not the only ones.\N- What? Someone turned on the cameras. Alex. Open doors.\NOpen fucking doors. Oh, fuck. Move. I'm afraid I can't do that. The ammunition\Nis display only. Now, did you really think\NI would be stupid enough to... Fuck yeah! Open the door, Alex! She's in here! Open the goddamn door! Goddammit, Alex! Open this door! No, no. Hey, no! If you're not gonna help\Nus, get the hell out. You fucking leave her alone! You understand me? - Alex!\N- That's my wife! Hey. Alex. Alex,\Nyou don't have to do this. Alex. Okay. Oh, God. Oh, God. I know, I know. - I know.\N- You gotta help me. You gotta help me. - She's everything to me.\N- I know. We'll get her out. - Okay, thank you. Please.\N- I promise. - Whose side are you on?\N- I distracted him, didn't I? Call it. Oh, fucking who cares? Tails. You take the head. Goddammit. - Wait, wait. I gotta get my gun.\N- Just come back for it. Move your ass! I'm carrying\Nthe heavy part, Father. Years of alcohol and drug\Nabuse have taken a toll. - Oh, my God.\N- Oh, my God. - I don't understand what's going on.\N- Okay. Okay. I need you to be quiet, okay? Look, I'm not even a maid. Mr. Le Domas,\Nhe just likes the way I dance. Okay, let's swap places. Yeah, cause they're looking for\Nme, they're not looking for you. So, come on. Come on. - Please.\N- She's over here! - She's here! She's over here!\N- No, no, no, no. - Oh, my God. Oh, my God.\N- Ow, ow, ow! Help me, please. - Shit.\N- Please. Shit. - Tony.\N- Yeah? - What are you doing?\N- Well... We're trying to\Nbring him back to us. Sir. Oh, man. Ow. I was unable to repair\Nthe security system. The doors and windows\Nremain unlocked. Oh. And I'm afraid that\NDora has been crushed, sir. By the dumbwaiter. And then there were none. Jesus Christ. She's taking us all out. - How's she doing this?\N- Sweetheart. It doesn't make sense, Becky. - She's a little blonde twig, and I don't...\N- Tony. Take a minute. But just a minute. We can't let her get out.\NWe've got to guard the doors. He lost his way. You should never have\Nlet him leave us. Excuse me? He and I have\Nalways been so much alike. I knew the girl\Nwould draw that card, and that he would face\Nthe same choice I faced. Horse shit. None of us expected\Nto be doing this tonight. I got a tee time at eight. And, in case\Nyou didn't notice, it wasn't much\Nof a choice for him. He's been helping her\Nfrom the get-go. - He hates us.\N- No. He's simply afraid\Nof who he truly is. Like I was. You'll never know\Nhow it felt that night <i>to be told that the only man\Nthat I'd ever loved had to die.</i> <i>But I should not have\Nfought it.</i> I should have\Nkilled Charles myself. There's still time for Alex\Nto do the right thing. He only has to\Naccept the truth. Uh, um, what truth is that? That he is meant to lead\Nthis family, not run from it. He's hated our\Npact from the very start. He's the good son.\NDo you remember that? Then why is he\Nthe only one of us who has ever seen\NMr. Le Bail in his chair? Good God. He was five. He was probably,\NI don't know, dreaming it. Or maybe he made it up. Well, if you say so. "What up, dawg?" Idiot. Not much. Family shit. Georgie? Oh, thank God. Okay. Okay, listen, I know this is\Nreally, really scary, but... Fuck. Shit. Fuck. Fuck. You little fucker! I got you. I got you, bitch. Fuck! She's outside, running\Ntowards the north fence. I'll get the others. Help me! Please help! Help. Please help me. Help! Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Help! Wait, stop. Please, please help me. Oh, thank God.\NThank you, thank you. - Get the fuck out of the road.\N- Please wait. What the fuck\Nis wrong with you? You fucking animal. You piece of shit, little, tiny\Ndick-licker, fucking asshole, fucking I... Fucking rich people. Fuck. <i>She must've gone\Ninto the woods.</i> <i>But don't worry, sir,\Nshe won't get far.</i> <i>I'll find her.</i> <i>And I'll fix the fence\Ntomorrow.</i> Well... she's out. Well... this was fun. What do you say we, uh, divvy up the\Nwedding gifts at brunch tomorrow? Do you think\Nthat this is a fucking game? Yes. Hide and seek, remember? Do you realize that if she lives till\Ndawn, that we're all gonna die? You all remember what happened\Nto the Van Horns, right? Um... didn't they just die\Nin a house fire? Yeah, that's what\Nthe press told you, but they... You don't wanna know how\Nthey really died. Trust me. No, you don't\Nfuck Mr. Le Bail. Mr. Le Bail fucks you. You couldn't have negotiated\Nbetter terms, huh, Vic? You couldn't have, uh... Oh, I don't know,\Nmaybe talked him down on the whole\Neradication clause? Well, here's to you, fucker, because now\Nwe are all fucking fucked! I think you made your point,\Nsweetheart, thank you. Oh, holy dick. Go wait for Stevens.\NHe might need your help. Not you two.\NI want you out of the way. Take the maids\Nto the goat pit. And, pumpkin,\Ntry not to kill anyone else. Cleanup duty for the fuckups. - No. Daddy.\N- Come on, Em. Listen to your mother. Hey, hey. So, at what point\Ndo we just cut and run? Right? I mean, come on. Right? Fuck you. Daniel! Daniel, help! Grace. Grace. Why did she have\Nto pull "hide and seek"? Do you think it's real? What? That we'll implode or burst into flames, or\Nwhatever, if we don't kill her? I don't know. Can you... All right, I'll... - I need, I need you to...\N- I can't. If you barf, I'll barf. One, two, three. Three. But you were with them the last time\Nthey played hide and seek, weren't you? Were you six, seven? Do you remember anything? I remember all of it. Alex was with me too. I tried to protect him. I don't know what he saw\Nor what he remembers. You always looked out for him. If that were true, I wouldn't\Nhave let him marry Grace. He deserved a better brother. And we all deserve to die. My kids don't. Mommy? Honey! Georgie. Are you okay?\NWhat are you doing out here? I... I followed that lady\Ndown here, and I shot her\Nwith that gun I found. Why would you do that? That's what everyone else\Nwas trying to do. Oh, sweetie. I am so proud of you. Shit. Come here, Grace! Fucking asshole! You motherfucker. <i>Thank you\Nfor calling Trip Safe.</i> <i>Please stay on the line\Nand you'll be connected</i> <i>to the next available\Nrepresentative.</i> <i>Good evening. This is\NJustin. Your call may be monitored...</i> People are trying to kill me.\NCan you please help me? <i>Uh, yes, I can help you\Nwith that.</i> <i>Um, do you need\Nmedical assistance, or...</i> Can you call the police,\Nplease? <i>Yes. I'd be happy\Nto help you with that.</i> <i>Sorry. The computer's\Nacting up again.</i> <i>Let me\Njust quickly reboot here.</i> Justin,\Njust call the fucking police. <i>Ma'am, it says here that\Nthe car was reported stolen.</i> <i>I'm sorry,\Nbut I have to shut it down.</i> No, what? No, what the fuck?\NAre you fucking kidding me? <i>It's company policy, ma'am.</i> - <i>There's nothing I can do.</i>\N- No, no, no, please. Justin. <i>Just stay with the vehicle, ma'am.\NPolice are on their way.</i> Just start the fucking car! - <i>'Kay, there's no need for profanity.</i>\N- Start the car, Justin! <i>Jesus, there's nothing I can do.\NMy hands are tied.</i> Justin. Hello? Justin! <i>Is there anything else\NI can help you with?</i> Yeah, you can go\Nfuck yourself, Justin! <i>Okay. Thanks for using Trip Safe.\NHave a great night.</i> Okay. You're okay,\Nyou're okay, you're okay. Police are on the way. Police are on their way.\NEverything's gonna be... Good night, Grace. Alex, is that you? Hey. Hey, you're safe now. We're leaving. <i>Where are you?</i> We're approaching\Nthe rear gate, sir. <i>We'll be there shortly.</i> All right.\NWe are back in business. Tony. Hey, Stevens! Look behind you. <i>Stevens!</i> Turn down the fucking music,\Nyou idiot! Oh. Oh! Oh, no. Oh, fuck. Fuck! Déjà vu. It's funny, I... came out here\Nto escape the madness. Thanks for crashing a car\Ninto my tranquility. Daniel. You don't wanna kill me.\NYou don't want me to die. No, I don't. I like you, Grace. So let me go. Okay? I'm weak. You're a good guy. You're a really,\Nreally, really good guy. And Alex, Alex loves you. And you love him. He's not gonna forgive you\Nif you do this. Maybe not. But at least he'll be alive. I can't let my entire family\Ndie because of you. It's insane. Can't you see it's insane? No one's gonna die...\NNo one, no one is gonna die. And you can\Ndo something about it. It's bullshit! No. I am not who you think I am. Alex is the one who got out. If anyone was gonna save you,\Nit would've been him. You can come out now. What, you knew I was here? I'm drunk, I'm not blind. Ooh, we gotta move.\NLess than an hour till dawn. And we still need to\Nprepare her for the ritual. Where's Grace? She's indisposed. You didn't think I was just\Ngonna let it happen, did you? With family,\None hopes for the best. The thing is... I like her. I don't wanna do this. But we have to\Nprotect the family. If she dies... I'll kill you. Well... then I suppose\NI'm dead either way. Yeah, and maybe it's a crock of\Nshit and nothing will happen. Oh, please. If you believed that, you wouldn't\Nhave let her draw a card at all. Why did you leave us, Alex? Oh, I don't know, Mom. I don't know. Maybe one night when I was\Nchanting and slicing the throat of a goat, it occurred to me that that wasn't\Na completely normal thing to do. But, and this is\Nwhat scared me the most... it felt normal. It did. And I realized that you'll\Ndo pretty much anything... if your family says it's okay. And then I met Grace. She's the opposite\Nof all of you. She's good. And she made me feel\Nlike I could be good too. So, if it comes down to\Nyou or her, I choose her. I don't believe you. And I don't think\Nthat you believe that a girl that you've known\Nfor a year and a half... knows you better than I do. Our family has a very special\Nfriend named Mr. Le Bail. Mr. Le Bail is the reason we\Nhave all the nice things we have. <i>But sometimes Mr. Le Bail wants\Nsomething from us in return.</i> You got this, Fitch. You got this, Fitch! Don't be a bitch, Fitch. Don't be a bitch, Fitch.\NYou got this, bitch. <i>I know tonight\Ndidn't go as planned.</i> <i>But I'll make it right,\NMr. Le Bail.</i> You'll see. We renew our\Npledge this night, as our ancestors before us... with this offering\Nof living flesh and blood. Hail... Brother! Poisoned! You son of a bitch! Oh, God. What did you give us? Stuff we poured on the maids.\NWhite bottle, little red cap. Hydrochloric acid! Come on, up and at 'em. Grace! - Did you... Did you just kill 'em?\N- No, I just gave them a nip. I Googled it. They'll shit weird\Nfor a week, but they'll be fine. - Don't worry, I'll get Alex out too.\N- Find them! We don't have... I knew you'd help me. I didn't. All I knew was, at some point,\Nsomebody had to burn it all down. Never thought it'd be me. Daniel. Get out of the way. Charity. You really don't care\Nif I die. You don't have to... Daniel. Daniel. Daniel. Go. Thank you. Thank you. Where do you think\Nyou're going, bitch? Who the fuck\Ndo you think you are? Our family's\Nweathered worse than you. You're just another sacrifice. You're another goat. Fuck the altar. I'm gonna do it right here. Grace? Daniel. Daniel. Daniel.\NHey. Hey, hey. Hey. Look at me. Oh, my God.\NHey, hey, look at me. In my defense,\Nit's been a while. Don't go. Don't go, okay? Daniel, don't go! Don't go!\NI need you, Daniel! Don't go! I meant what I said this\Nmorning. I thought you were\Ngonna be the new me. But I'm not gonna let you\Nhurt my family! You can die. You don't deserve a family. Fuck your family. Fuck your fucking family! Grace. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Yeah, I'm sorry too. Daniel's dead. You won't be with me\Nafter this, will you? Alex... Alex. Alex. - You're hurting me.\N- She's in here! No, please, no, no! Please! Let me go! Attaboy. Oh, Becky. Oh. The sun is about to rise!\NWe must do it now! It is time for your boys\Nto take their place. Deliver us, O mighty one, from all past error\Nand delusion. That, having set our foot\Nupon the path of darkness, we may not weaken\Nin our resolve. But, with thy assistance,\Ngrow in wisdom and strength. <i>Shemhameforash!</i> <i>Shemhameforash.</i> <i>Shemhameforash.</i> <i>Shemhameforash.</i> <i>Shemhameforash!</i> <i>Shemhameforash!</i> Hail Satan!
