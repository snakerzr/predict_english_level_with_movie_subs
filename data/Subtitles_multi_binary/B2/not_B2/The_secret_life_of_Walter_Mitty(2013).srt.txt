I've never heard\Nof that, but, okay. You're trying to use your eHarmony\Naccount for the first time? I am.\NOkay. I'm looking\Nat your profile. We have a pretty intricate\Nmatching algorithm. That's what distinguishes us from\Nother online dating services. Yeah, I like that. Actually, I'm just trying to\Nleave a wink for one person. Cheryl Melhoff. She started in my division\Nat work about a month ago... and I overheard her near the bagels\Nsaying she was on your site. Okay, that's unique. But let me ask you. You left a lot\Nof this stuff... like the "Been There, Done That" section,\Nyou left it blank. Yeah, I think\NI skipped it. Okay, you got to\Nhelp me out here, man. Don't skip stuff.

I just live by the ABC's:\NAdventurous, Brave, Creative. That's everything I want in a man. My man? Hey, my man,\Nyou still there? Hey. What? Did you pass out or...

But I just got a phone\Ncall about a really big audition,\Nso can you go finish it? No, I can't. I'm late.\NWalter, I... I don't think you're seeing\Nthis from what I need. What do you need? I need to be\NRizzo in Grease. I don't understand that. My audition! Rizzo!\NRizzo? Rizzo! She's\Ntough and tender! Do me a favor, please. Make sure Mom's piano gets moved\Nin all the way. All right? Don't go to Rizzo! Oh, thanks, Walter.\NHappy birthday! Guess what?\NWe just got acquired. Yeah, I heard. Yeah, there's gonna\Nbe changes. Downsizing of us into some kind\Nof dot-com thing, possibly. I wonder how this\Nthing goes down, how the transition's\Ngonna play out. I could probably tell you. Ted Hendricks, managing\Ndirector of the transition. Hey. Tim Naughton.\NSales. Gary Mannheim,\Ngraphic design. And what do\Nyou do, cake man? Oh, uh... The cake's just for today.\NI'm not a cake man. I do... I deal dirctly... "Dirctly"? Directly with\NLIFE'S photo units... I'm sorry, I was really\Ngetting into this song and I stopped\Nlistening to you. I was saying, you know who\Nlooks good in a beard? Dumbledore, not you. Guy? Guy? What do you do? I'm a negative\Nasset manager. Worth the wait. Mind over matter Ted.\NDonny. Feeling tough?\NFeeling good. Well, got to make\Nsome tough calls ahead. You been here\Nbefore, yeah? Yeah, so this is it, huh? Yeah, the\N"house of pictures." Hey. Hi.\NHow was your weekend? I had an awesome weekend. And what did\Nyou do this weekend? Um... Let's see. I bathed in Arctic\Nmountain water... while my Latin lover\Nrecited verse to me. You slut.\NI know. Actually, I waited for my refrigerator\Nrepairman, who never came. I'm so sorry. I'm gonna\Ncall you later. Okay. The ice, yes? She moves like a woman. I'm Walter. Mitty. Cheryl. Melhoff. Where have you been? Testing the limits\Nof the human espirit. I'd like to climb your\Nhair, test that out. Perhaps I can contact you,\Npossibly through my poetry falcon. Poetry falcon. I like that. Do you think, if I hit him with\Na paper clip, would he move? I don't know. Do it. Hello. I actually threw\Na toner box at him once. Yeah? Did he move? No, I missed. That's a great story. Ground Control\Nto Major Tom. Can you hear me,\NMajor Tom? Oh! Wow. Moving on, as they say. Conference room,\Nmore of these stations here... where people sort\Nof do their thing. Layout's here for... Morning, Hernando! There's a new nut\Npouch, did you hear? Yeah. I met him. We're gonna\Nbe evaluated. They won't be able to. We do\Nintricate details back here. Yeah. It's tricky.\NAnd bewildering. I should evaluate you,\Nyou should evaluate me. I don't think\Nthey'll let us do that. Just saying. Hey, how long has this neg roll been here...\Nout in the open? It says "Sean O'Connell." It came in this morning. There's a present, too.\NHe sent you a present, on your desk. Sean O'Connell\Nstill shoots on film. That results for\Nme in a man crush. Hey, you want\Nto mount these? Seriously? Sure. Heard rumblings\NLIFE'S done, man. Wanted to say thanks. Take a look inside, a gift for\Nall the years of hard work. Sorry about the neg roll. I spilled some blood on it... while self-stitching\Na gun wound to my abdomen... but number 25 is my best ever. The quintessence\Nof life, I think. I trust you'll get it\Nwhere it needs to go... you always do. What did you get? It's a wallet. With LIFE'S motto on it. Here you go. Where's 25?\NIt's not there. Hey, we need negative 25. Sean O'Connell\Nsent a telegram. An actual telegram. A 100-year-old dude\Ncame in a little hat. So there's\Na floor meeting. Bring 25. It's here somewhere.\NWe'll find it. Okay, make a contact sheet of\Nthese frames as soon as you can. And don't say\Nanything to anyone. Yeah. I just wanted to inform you\Nall reluctantly, that... I guess, just start back\Nfrom the beginning. Okay. I just wanted to inform\Nyou all reluctantly... that this month's issue\Nwill be our last. What? Yeah. What? This is some bull! It's sad... news, for sure. Now, you're all\Nvalued employees. But as we undergo this\Ntransition to LIFE online... we wanted to be\Ncandid with you... that some of you will be\Ndetermined non-vital employees... to the new partnership. And we'll be deciding\Nwhich of those positions... will be remaining with us over\Nthe course of the next week. Also, we feel sad about\Nthat, as you can see. Now for some good news. We are very excited...\NAll right, Don. Ted Hendricks. Managing\Ndirector of the transition. Never fun,\Nthis stage. But we do have ahead of us\Nthe privilege of publishing... what will be the very last\Nissue of LIFE magazine. And for the final issue,\Nwe just received a telegram. Come on. From Sean O'Connell... who has never,\NI'm told, been willing... to speak with\Nthe executives here. Well, he broke\Nhis long silence and shared his\Nthoughts with us... through that old man. Sean O'Connell. "I expect full consideration\Nof negative 25 for cover. "My most grand. "The quintessence of life." What is that? It means like the\Nfullest and most rich. Okay. So our cover will probably\Nbe the most famous ever... because it really will have the\Nbig quintessence of all time. Very full and so rich. So let's see this thing. Huh? Let's see it. Can we... What am I doing up here?\NWhat's going on? We'll receive it now\Nfrom Negative Assets. This gentleman.\NThe last man in. Negative Assets.\NWhat's that? Ah, Major Tom. Can I get that? It's being processed. All right. Well,\Nlet's do it. Let's process\Nsome quintessence. Come on. Go. Now. That's why I'm clapping. When do we go to press?\NTwo and a half weeks. Hi. Hi. I'm Walter. Cheryl. Melhoff. Mitty. Yes. You work in Photo Accounts, right?\NI do. Negative Assets. Yes. Lam. You're processing the last cover photo.\NThat's a big deal. Yeah, it's... there's a...\Nwe have a glitch. Mini, on that\None right now. I wanted to say,\Nto you... do you maybe have an address\Nfor Sean O'Connell? Um... It's not really\Nthat easy with him. He moves around\Nso much. I don't. Yeah, he's on a freelance. I don't know where and\Nhe doesn't have a phone. No phone? He's old school. Yeah. But, you know, why don't\NI check with Peg? I know she just processed\Na check for him. And we could track his pay-out maybe.\NFind him that way? Cool. Very cool.\NOkay. Walter.\NYes. I'm on it. Thanks. Yes. Are you coming? Yes, I'm not. Yes, I have\Nto stay. Here's the\Ncontact sheet. What do you see? This photo cluster.\NThese three. They're the only\Nprintable ones. He took them around the\Nsame time he took 25. They could give us a clue\Nto where Sean is. Blow them up,\Nall right? Cool. Hey. Walter, right? Yeah. So, I called Peg about Sean.\NShe's gonna get back to me. Oh! Hey, thanks. Cool glasses,\Nvery Sand People. These? No,\Nthese are loupes. They're for work.\NThey magnify the... Is that 25? Can I see? That's... No. I can't quite\Nfind 25... just now. You can't find it? Yeah. That's why\NI'm trying to find Sean. I'm trying to track him down\Nsomehow with these other images. His whereabouts? Yeah. I take this class,\NWriting the Mystery Novel. Anyway, they say the key\Nis to work backwards. You connect the clues and then\Nscatter them so they seem unrelated. There's like a whole\Nscience to it. May I?\NSure. Okay. Thumb. Yeah. It's an\Nunknown thumb. Okay. Water? Just water, I guess? Yeah, just water. Okay. And... like a curved piece of... some kind of, part of a thing. But the thing with clues,\Nmy teacher says... is you really only need one good one,\Nand then they'll connect... and you'll be like, "Oh, yes,\Nof course, unknown thumb, water... "I should have seen this\Nthe whole time. Ahh!" Yeah, yeah,\NI'll be like... Well, anyway, I should get\Nback and try not to get fired. Hey, Cheryl. I have something creative\NI've been working on, too. Oh. Little side project. Walter, it's amazing! Walter? I was just saying I'll let you know\Nwhen I hear back from Peg. Okay. Thank you. Okay. Hey, Odessa. What? Is there a larger apartment\Navailable the piano could fit in? Because it's a memento\Nof our mom's. That's a really big... Most people sell their really big\Nmementos before they move here. My dad bought it for her\Nthe year they were married. It means a lot to her. That's a villa.\NIt's a little more costly... but it has a more generous, piano kind\Nof size living room for you though. Yeah. Yeah,\Nthis is good. On move-in,\Nyou'd need first month's, last month's,\Nand full deposit. That's $4,700.\NGreat. Yeah, okay. Yeah, we'll take it.\NI'll get the paperwork. The new villa comes\Nopen in three weeks. I'm guessing. Happy birthday. Stretch Armstrong! That's cool. Yeah. Isn't\Nthat awesome? This was your favorite thing when\Nwe were little. Do you remember? You want to do it? Yeah, all right. Come on, Stretch!\NGood, good! Come on, we got to go. A villa, okay, but hey, I'm\Nnot the Queen of Sheba. You got to have\Nroom for your piano. You can stay at my place\Nuntil it's ready. I won't be cramping\Nyour scene? My scene? No. And sorry we couldn't\Nget you in here today. Walter! Look what I found! This is from you\Nand Tim Linderman. Do you remember, we were\Ngonna backpack Europe? That June Dad died? Man! What is in here? That's my Walter box. Some of my Walter\Nknick-knacks and keepsakes. You made the\Nbest mix tapes! Oh, man.\NWhat? What's that? Travel journal Dad gave me. Oh. You should donate that, because\Nyou never used it, to a poor kid. A poor kid who's\Ngonna travel to Europe? Look at you\Nand your dad! Is that my\Ntournament one? He was so proud of this. Sharing your accomplishments\Nwith the whole world. It's from the\N<i>Fairview Smalltowner,</i> Mom. Well, I really\Nliked that nifty mohawk. You know, when\Nyour daddy died... and then you went to work\Nin that pizza place... the one that was named after a father,\Nhad that father kind of name. Papa John's. Yeah, delivery. And I thought perhaps that\Nit was really sad for you... working in a restaurant\Nnamed after a father after your father just died. I never even\Nthought about that. Probably because\NI didn't call Dad "Papa." You had a weird style. That wasn't my style.\NThat was a uniform. KFC. My worker bee. "Word in the water"? Okay, you know what?\NI got to go. We're getting you into\Na villa situation, okay? Okay.\NGood, everybody? My worker bee... and my performance artist bee!\NThank you, Mom. Hernando.\NHey. I don't see anything.\NUpper middle. It's faint. There's a\Nword in the water. I'm getting\Nnervous, Walter. Hey, this is an ocean. That's a boat. "Erkigsnek." He was near this boat. See you in a few. I'll check the mailroom. Final cover. Big responsibility. Oh, is that\Nmy quintessence? No. We're prepping the wetting agents\Non that to start the process. Really? Because it looks like\Nyou're playing with toys. No, this is a gift. Yeah, the negative needs to go\Nthrough a very technical... I'm sorry. I can't have a\Nprofessional conversation with you. You and your\Nlittle blonde pal. Let's... You can't walk through\Nthe office with him. Let's have it.\NI'll put it away. Give me the toy, man!\NNo! Now. This is a place of business,\Nnot a place of jelly-man toys! Get off it! No, I'm taking it! You can't just\Ntake my stuff! It's mine!\NGive it to me! No! Stop fiddling with sweets\Nand little men! I'm trying to do my job! Are you the Tin Man? Need a little oil can? Jesus.

Then Nashville... but that was just\Nthe airport on the way to Phoenix,\Nso I don't know if that... Uh-huh... Hey, man, I was thinking,\Nif you work with this girl... why don't you just\Nhumanly invite her out? No, no, no, I'm trying to do\Nlike a "Pina Colada Song" thing. "Pina Colada Song"? Yeah, you know, a guy posts an ad,\Nlooking for a lover... and then his\Nwife answers it... and it turns out they were soul\Nmates and didn't even know it... and they end up making love\Nin capes, or on a cape. It's a song? Can you\Nsing a little bit? If you like pina coladas,\Ngetting caught in the rain You know that song?\NI have to go. Is that Hall & Oates? Hey!\NHey. Is that another clue? Yeah.

Yeah, starting now. Okay. Yeah, we got to figure this out.\NIt's a big deal. You lost a\NSean O'Connell. I used to work\Nat Nabisco. And then,\NI had a change... and I decided\Nto apply to LIFE. Thought it would be more\Ncolorful, less regular, I guess. You know, I just like\Nthe idea of it. I like the motto\Nof the company. Do you know it? "To see the world... "Things dangerous\Nto come to... "To see behind walls." Yeah, I... I got this, from Sean. He gave this to you? Yeah. I like that,\N"TO DRAW CLOSER." So, what's he like in person? Sean?\NYeah.

Good luck. Photographic Accounts. Cheryl.\NThis is Cheryl Melhoff. Hey, it's Walter Mitty. Hey. I'd walked down\Nto say hi to you about an hour ago,\Nand you weren't there. That's because,\Nguess what. I'm in Iceland. Iceland? Wait, wasn't it Greenland? Yeah. Yeah, it was. You know that they're\Nnot the same place. No, no, no. I went to\NGreenland and then... I got on a fishing vessel tracking\NSean and ended up here in Iceland. You're in Iceland. Yeah. At a Papa John's. Hey, I got more clues. What did you find? There's a date\Nthat Sean wrote. And some words\Non a cake wrapper. "Rajqawee," "Buzkashi"... and "Warlocks." Wait. They have a\NPapa John's in Iceland? Yeah. I just had to...\NI just left. Did you get kicked out? No, I just needed to leave. Just the atmosphere. And the cups. Hey, I was right\Non Sean's trail. Then I lost him. "Strong little man." Thanks. No. "Rajqawee" means\N"strong little man"... in, like,\N40 Arabic countries. And "Buzkashi" is\N"goat hockey"... in Central Asia. And "Warlocks"... Yeah. I was hoping\Nthey would connect. So, you said that you left Papa\NJohn's because of the cups? Is there something I should\Nbe aware of as a customer? No, I just worked there,\Nthat's all. I used to have a mohawk... and a backpack... and this idea of who I wanted\Nto be and what I wanted to do. Yeah? Nothing. Just... I was pretty\Nclose with my dad. And he died when I\Nwas 17, on a Tuesday. And we didn't\Nhave any savings. So I got a haircut\Nthat Thursday... and a job the same Thursday. Papa John's? Yeah. Your dad let\Nyou have a mohawk? He shaved my head. That's a good dad move. Yeah. Is it nice there? Yeah, it is. It's really beautiful. Well, it's pretty\Nsucky here. Human Resources\Nhas already started letting some of\Nthe staff go... so it'll be a lot different\Nwhen you get back. Hey, I picked\Nsomething up for... I think I lost you. You know what? I'll catch\Nyou up when I see you. Great. Okay. All right. Okay. Bye, Walter. Bye, Cheryl. What's going on? They shut down\Ntwo floors. Why do you\Nlook rugged? I see you. I see you! What did I say? I see you. The photograph.\NNow. Let me see it. He looked it up. There's no\Nsuch thing as a silver bath. Listen, there was uncertainty\Nabout the negative. I understood that, hopefully,\Nit was in Iceland. It was in your care. If you just give\Nme some more time... You're fired. We'll make another cover. Hey! More than a million, way more,\Nnegatives have come through my office. I have never mislaid one. Put it on a plaque.\NHang it at your next job. Now I got to explain\Nthis to the board? Hey. Are you okay? Yeah. That's cool. It's a skateboard.\NIt's for Cheryl's son. Cheryl's not in.\NShe was let go. I told you, man,\Nit's bad. Hey! That's my fern. Thank you. Hi. Hi. Can I...? Yeah. I'm looking for\NCheryl Melhoff. You want Cheryl? Yeah. She's... We work together, and she was\Nhelping me with a work thing. Cheryl. Honey? There's some guy here. What? From work. Okay, hold on.\NI'm on the phone. It's Conan. Tonight, First Lady Michelle\NObama, Walter Mitty. Can we talk\Nabout your love life? I think people\Nwould be interested. You don't want to know\Nabout my love life. I think they do. Yeah, I think they do. Now, I\Ndon't believe everything I read. There's a scandal?\NA little scandal? A little scandal, yes. She was back with her\Nhusband, or something. Then she fell for you? Where there's smoke,\Nthere's fire. You're awesome, Walter. Thanks. Sure. Can you turn this off? It stays on. I'm just going to get out. Hey, Mom. Hi, honey. Walter, you got\Nto tip these guys. We got the piano\Nback safe, Mom. Are you back\Nfrom your work trip? Yeah, this morning. Hungry? Mmm-hmm.

You\Njust let yourself out. He's good for this. Are you gonna\Nstay for dinner? Oh, Mom,\NI'd love to. I think I'm just\Nreally wiped out after supervising moving\Nthat thing all day. I think I just need to go to\Nyoga and then just crash. What is it?\NA class? Yes, yoga. It's a class. I go to the hot\Nkind, where they heat the room. Have you heard of that? Sure. You have?\NIt's great for you. You just get it all\Nout of your system. You get your sweat out, you just\Nget everything, all your fear. I'm waiting on a call\Nabout an audition. That Grease show? Yeah.\NRizzo? Yeah. I'm really\Nexcited about it. What's good about this is that\NI just don't worry about it. I just get\Nout of my head. Is that good for you? I feel like it's good\Nin a class like this. I mean, I'm not going to get\Npaid for it, which is fine. It's not about money.\NWonderful. And I feel like... It's just for kids, but I think it's\Nimportant for them to start early. I'm really\Nthrilled, Mom. I think I'm just\Ngoing to enjoy it. Just standing in front\Nof people and talking. You'll be good at that.\NYeah. You'll really be good at that.\NI think so, too, Mom. Hey. Mom? Yeah. Did somebody take a picture of\Nyour piano, like, a week ago? I did. With Sean's camera. Sean O'Connell's camera? Yeah, he came to visit. Mom, what? Yeah. He wanted to know\Nabout your work schedule, when you left,\Nwhen you came home. He said you\Nreally understood LIFE. He was really\Ninterested in your work. Mom, why didn't you tell me? I told you. I told you\Nin the produce aisle. I remember that. Maybe you were... Odessa, what is it you call it when he\Ngoes into one of his little places? "Zoned out." You do that\Nnow and then. What's the matter? I got fired. I lost a picture of his. Can you find it? No, I don't know\Nwhere he is. He's someplace\Nwith warlocks or... Warlords. No, warlocks. No. Warlords. Sean said he had to meet\Nwith warlords very soon... and maybe he\Nwould take my cake so that he could\Nget permission... to trek through\Nthe wilds and places. He said he wants to photograph\Nsnow leopards. How about that? Who? "Ungoverned Afghanistan." Mmm-hmm. That's where Sean is. Crazy Afghanistan. Yeah. In the upper Himalayas. They can't\Nlet you go. You were Sean's partner. He told me... that you were the person\Nwho worked the hardest... to make sure his work was\Nrealized the way he wished. You finish his work. Heaven is a switchboard\Nthat you want to fight She would even miss you\Nif you taught her sight Power politician leaning\Nto the right Baby's got a trust fund That she'll want to\Ngo off like that Get off of my stack Leave a little window Get off of my stack Now we wear same-colored\Nyellow uniforms Sky is burning but at\Nleast we know we're warm Go and run yourself\Na million miles Hoping that the colors run out And you go off like that Get off of my stack Stack Hey, Todd. Hey, what's up? Not much. Hey, good news. Your profile\Nreally rounded out, man. That volcano-shark combo. That is money in the bank.\NGet ready to get a lot of winks. Okay. But something else.

Todd, I'm gonna\Nkeep this short. I have to make\Noxygen choices. Hey, I get it. so! Anyway, you have a profile now.\NCongratulations. Cool, but,\Nyou know what? Would you take me off? I can't really\Nswing that $500 yearly. Hey. Hey, man. You're sure?\NBecause I feel like we're really\Nonto something here. Do you mind?\NI'm working. This is one of the best\Nprofiles I've ever done. And our refund policy,\Nwell, we don't have one... Todd, I got to go. Sean. Yeah. It's Walter. Mitty. Walter Mitty. Seriously? How the hell did\Nyou get up here? I just... I've been looking for you. Sit down. I'll sit. Well, take your time.\NSettle in. Try to be\Nreal still, okay? There's a snow leopard. Right in this ridge. So we have to try to be very,\Nvery, very, very still. They call the snow\Nleopard the "ghost cat." it never lets\Nitself be seen. Ghost cat? Beautiful things\Ndon't ask for attention. Sean, there was a negative that\Ngot separated from your roll. I'm taking a lot of\Nheat over it at work. It never came with the\Nroll that you sent. The last roll\Nyou're talking about? Yeah. The 25. Yeah. You're sitting on it. Why am I sitting on it? It's in your wallet. That was the gift. The photograph. The wallet was just something\NI could put it in. So, I put it in a little slot,\Nthe little picture holder in there. I thought it\Nwould be cute. I told you,\N"look inside." In the note. You said "look inside." I thought you meant look\Ninside of the wrapping paper. Yeah? Well, you got a real\Nnice surprise coming. No, I don't have it. I don't have\Nit anymore. Whoa! What the hell\Nwere you thinking? I mean, I'm sorry, I've admired\Nyou for a very long time... but that is not a good move,\Nat all, with a valuable negative. Sorry, I just... I thought it would be\Na playful kind of thing. Playful? Too playful. I see what you're saying. With the cover, I should have\Nbeen more straightforward. But can I ask you, I mean,\Nif you don't mind... what did you do\Nwith the wallet? Chucked it. Well, that hurts\Nmy feelings. No. Man, I liked\Nit very much. I appreciated\Nit very much. So you threw it away? So, you have no\Nidea what it was? The photograph? It's a shame. It was a beauty. How did you\Nfind me, anyway? My mom. Cool lady. Knows\Nhow to bake. Yeah. Hey, why did you...\NShh! When are you gonna take it? Sometimes I don't. If I like a moment... I mean, me, personally... I don't like to have the\Ndistraction of the camera. Just want to stay in it. Stay in it? Yeah, right there. Right here. Now it's gone.\NIt's gone. That looks like fun. I think I'm\Ngonna jump in. Hey, what was\Nthe picture, Sean? We're gonna be odd-numbered\Nif you don't join. What was the picture? Let's just call it a ghost cat,\NWalter Mitty.
