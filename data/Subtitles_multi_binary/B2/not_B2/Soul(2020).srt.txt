That's C-sharp, horns. Two, three...\NI see you, Caleb. Rachel, now you. Forgot my sax, Mr G. Okay, she forgot her sax.\NAnd now, all you, Connie. Go for it! Way to go! Hang on, hang on.\NWhat are y'all laughing at? So Connie got a little lost in it. That's a good thing. Look, I remember one time my dad took me to this jazz club, and that's the last place I wanted to be. But then I see this guy, and he's playing these chords\Nwith fourths on it, and then with the minor... Oh, oh, whoo. Then he adds the inner voices,\Nand it's like he's... It's like he's singing. And I swear, the next thing I know... ...it's like he floats off the stage. That guy was lost in the music. He was in it, and he took\Nthe rest of us with him. And I wanted to learn... ...how to talk like that. That's when I knew... I was born to play. Connie knows what I mean.\NRight, Connie? I'm 12. I'll be right back.\NPractise your scales. Sorry to interrupt, Mr Gardner. You're doing my ears a favour. - Hey!\N- Not you, though, you're good. He's not. What can I do for you, Principal Arroyo? I wanted to deliver\Nthe good news personally. No more part-time for you. You're now our full-time band teacher. Job security. Medical insurance. Pension. Wow. That's, uh, great. Welcome to the M.S. 70 family, Joe.\NPermanently. Thanks. After all these years,\Nmy prayers have been answered. A full-time job. Working man, coming through. Yeah, Mom, but I... You're going to tell them yes, right? Don't worry, Mom, I got a plan. You always got a plan. Maybe you need to have a backup plan, too, for when your plan falls through. A backup plan never hurts. Joey, we didn't struggle\Ngiving you an education so you could be a middle-aged man washing your underwear in my shop. Walking around with a hole in his pants. - Yeah, but...\N- With this job, you'll be able to put that dead-end gigging behind you. And Lord knows we need\Nmore teachers in this world. And just think, playing music will finally\Nbe your real career. So you're going to tell them yes, right? Please say yes. Yeah, definitely. Good. Hello? How you been, Mr G? Uh, it's Curley. Lamont.\NLamont Baker. Hey, Curley!\NHey, good to hear your voice, man. Uh... Listen.\NYou can call me Joe now, Curley. I'm not your teacher anymore. <i>Oh, okay, Mr Gardner.</i> <i>Hey, look, I'm the new drummer\Nin the Dorothea Williams Quartet,</i> <i>and we're kickin' off our tour\Nwith a show at The Half Note tonight.</i> Dorothea Williams!\NAre you kidding me? Are you kidding me?\NCongratulations, man. Wow! I would die a happy man if I could perform with Dorothea Williams. <i>Oh, well,\Nthis could be your lucky day.</i> - Whew, there he is.\N- Hey, Curley. Leon skipping town\Nreally put us in a bind, man. - Yeah. Uh, I'll bet.\N- I'm glad you made it. My boy, Bishop, said he sat in with you\Non a set last year in Brooklyn. Said you were great. Well, you know,\Nfor a coffee shop. Hey, Dorothea. This is the cat I was telling you about. My old middle school band teacher,\NMr Gardner. Call me Joe, Dorothea. Uh... Uh, I mean, Miss Williams. It's a pleasure. Wow.\NThis is amazing. Uh, Joe is Ray Gardner's son. So, we're down to\Nmiddle school band teachers now. Get on up here, Teach,\Nwe ain't got all day. What... What are we playin'? Uh, sorry. I zoned out a little back there. Joe Gardner, where have you been? I've been, uh, teaching,\Nmiddle school band. Uh, but on the weekends, I... - You got a suit?\N- Uh... Get a suit, Teach.\NA good suit. Back here tonight.\NFirst show's at 9:00. Soundcheck's at 7:00. We'll see how you do. Yes! Whoo-hoo! You see that, Dad?\NThat's what I'm talking about! Hey, look up, look up. You know what that's gonna say?\NJoe Gardner! You're never gonna believe\Nwhat just happened. I did it. I got the gig. Yes! I... I know. Dorothea Williams!\NCan you believe it? Hey, pal, you're gonna get hurt! Just don't tell my mom about this. Okay? Forget class. I'm in a different class. I'm in a Dorothea Williams class, buddy. You know what I'm saying? I'm... Whoa! Sorry! What the... Hello? Hello? What the... Hey! Hey, hey, hey! Hello! Hello. Oh, what's your name, honey? Uh, I'm Joe. Joe Gardner. Look, I'm not supposed to be here. Ah. Must have been sudden for you. You see, Joe, I'm 106 years old. Been waiting a long time for this. - For what?\N- The Great Beyond. The Great Beyond? - As in, as in beyond life?\N- Yeah. That's death right there? Exciting, isn't it? No, no, no, listen. I have a gig tonight.\NI can't die now. Well, I really don't think you have a lot to say about this. Yes. Yes, I do. I'm not dying the very day\NI got my shot. I'm due. Heck, I'm overdue. Uh-uh, uh-uh.\NI'm outta here. I don't think you're supposed\Nto go that way. This can't happen.\NI'm not dyin' today. Not when my life just started. What was that? Wait. I'm not finished.\NI gotta get back. I don't wanna die! I'm not done.\NI'm not done. Run! - Why aren't you running?\N- I don't know. - What's wrong with you people?\N- I don't know. I'm not done. Ahh! Oh, my goodness.\NOh, my goodness. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Excuse me. Help! I'm not done.\NI gotta get back. Oh, my... Oh, my goodness. What? Ow! Now, now, everyone, let's give the mentor some room. Sorry, new souls.\N37, that's enough. - Hey, everyone, look here.\N- Quiet coyote. Shh. Quiet coyote. Who... Who are you? I am the coming together of all quantised fields of the universe. Appearing in a form\Nyour feeble human brain can comprehend. - What?\N- You can call me Jerry. Jerry, okay. Uh, hey, is this heaven? No. Is it H-E-double hockey sticks? - Hell.\N- Hell, hell, hell. - Shh. Quiet coyote.\N- Hell. It's easy to get turned around. This isn't the Great Beyond.\NIt's the Great Before. The Great Before? Oh. We call it the You Seminar now.\NRebranding. Hell. No, no. You're here! Does this mean I'm dead? Not yet. Your body's in a holding pattern. It's complicated. I'll get you back to your group. Come on, little souls, get on up here. Welcome to the You Seminar. You are in for a treat. - Mm, that's weird.\N- What is it? - The count's off.\N- Excuse me? There's a soul missing.\NThe count's off. Huh. Okay, first stop\Nis the Excitable Pavilion. You four. In you go. You five, you'll be aloof.\NAnd you two, why not? Oh, wait a minute. This is where personalities come from? Of course. Do you think people\Nare just born with them? So, uh, how do they get to Earth, then? Well, they use the Earth portal. Once they get a complete personality,\Nof course. Hello? Hello? Goodbye. Whee! Whoo-hoo! Wait, wait, wait. You sure get lost a lot. All righty, mentors. - Just find your name here...\N- Hello, Jerry... ...and join us inside. ...got a lost mentor for you. Thanks, Jerry. Uh, look, I'm not sure\NI'm supposed to be here. I understand. Mentoring isn't for everyone. You're more than welcome to opt out. Actually, on second thought, you know, the mentoring sounds like fun. I'm glad to hear it.\NJerry will take it from here. Thanks, Jerry.\NHead right on over there to Jerry. Thank you, Jerry. Is everyone here named Jerry? Good luck! Jerry, we've got a problem. Oh, hello, there, Terry. The count's off. I seriously doubt that. The count hasn't been off in centuries. 151,000 souls go into\Nthe Great Beyond every day. That's 105.2 souls per minute, Jerry. 1.75 souls per second. And I count every single one of 'em. Yep. I'm aware. It's my job to keep track\Nof this stuff, Jerry. I'm the accountant. And we all think\Nyou're doing a wonderful job, - don't we, everyone?\N- Absolutely. Looks good from where this guy's standing. I'd say no. I'm always counting.\NI'm counting right now. You blinked five times\Nsince I started talking. Six. Right. Since accounting is your job, why don't you figure out the problem? - Maybe I will.\N- Wonderful. Hello again, Terry. Don't play dumb with me. Okay, here we go. "A." <i>Hello, there, mentors.</i> <i>I'm Jerry, a counselor here\Nat the You Seminar.</i> <i>Now you don't remember it,\Nbut you've been here before.</i> <i>But don't worry,\Nforgetting the trauma of childbirth</i> <i>is one of the great gifts of the universe.</i> <i>Here at the You Seminar,</i> <i>all new souls are given unique\Nand individual personalities.</i> <i>I'm an agreeable sceptic\Nwho's cautious yet flamboyant.</i> <i>I'm an irritable wallflower\Nwho's dangerously curious.</i> <i>I'm a manipulative megalomaniac\Nwho's intensely opportunistic.</i> <i>Oh-ho, this one might be a handful.</i> <i>But that's Earth's problem.</i> <i>You'll notice these souls\Nare all missing something.</i> <i>What goes in this spot?</i> <i>Well, these souls need their "spark".</i> <i>And that's where you come in.</i> <i>Maybe you will find their spark</i> <i>in the Hall of Everything,</i> <i>where literally anything\Non Earth could inspire.</i> <i>Or perhaps you'll prefer the Hall of You,</i> <i>featuring a selection of moments\Nfrom your own inspiring life.</i> <i>And just what is this spark?</i> <i>I know you're all excited to get to work,</i> <i>so good luck finding the spark.</i> Find the spark. Wow, that was informative. Now, it's time for my favourite\Npart of the programme, matching you mentors with your soul mates. Our first mentor is Maria Martinez. Maria, come on down. Maria was a rare disease specialist from the University of Mexico. <i>I'm cured. I'm cured.</i> She'll be matched\Nwith one of my favourites, soul number 108,210,121,415. Congratulations! Off you go. Our next mentor is Bjorn T. Börgensson. Dr Börgensson\Nis a world-renowned child psychologist who was recently awarded a Nobel Prize. <i>I see pain, death, destruction.</i> - <i>How about now?</i>\N- <i>A pretty butterfly.</i> Dr Börgensson will be matched\Nwith soul number 22. Oh, we're gonna get into this now.\NExcuse me. 22, you come out of\Nthis dimension right now. How many times\Ndo I have to tell you? I don't wanna go to Earth. - Stop fighting this, 22.\N- I don't wanna. You will go to Earth - and have a life.\N- Make me! 22 has been at the You Seminar\Nfor quite some time and has had such\Nnotable mentors as Gandhi, Abraham Lincoln, and Mother Teresa. I made her cry. Ignore that. Put me down. We're truly glad to have you here,\NDr Börgensson. It is an honour having you\Nprepare 22 for Earth. I'm gonna make you wish you never died. Most people wish that, 22. Off you go. Bye! Where are we? That's great progress. You should be very proud.\NStep by step. In celebration of\NDr Börgensson's body of work, we are pleased to present him\Nthis honorary... These past few weeks,\NI have seen such growth. So many people I'd like to thank,\Nof course. Okay, look,\NI'm sure your life was amazing and you did amazing things, but here's what we're gonna do. We're gonna stand here\Nin silence for a little bit, then we go back out, you say you tried, I go back to not living my non-life\Nand you go to the Great Beyond. - No, look.\N- Talk all you want, Bjorn. It's not gonna work, anyway. I've had thousands of mentors\Nwho failed and now hate me. Mother Teresa... I have compassion for every soul. Except you. I don't like you. Copernicus... The world doesn't revolve around you, 22. Muhammad Ali... You are the greatest pain in the butt. Marie Antoinette... Nobody can help you! Nobody! Thanks, but no thanks, Doc. I already know everything about Earth, and it's not worth the trouble. Come on, don't you want\Nto fill out your pass? You know, I'm comfortable up here. I have my routine. I float in mist, I do my Sudoku puzzles, and then, like, once a week, they make me come\Nto one of these You Seminars. It's not great, but I know what to expect. Look, kid, I'm not...\NCan I just be honest with you? I'm not Bjorn Borgenstein or whatever his name is.\NI'm not even a mentor. Not a mentor? Ah... Reverse psychology. You really are a good shrink, Doctor. Carl Jung already tried that. Stop talking!\NMy unconscious mind hates you! Is there any way to show a different life in this place? Wait. You're really not Bjorn Börgensson? It's my life. Um, excuse me, what's going on here? Binaca breath spray?\NCheap cologne? Man, who curated this exhibit? You did. <i>♪ I go to Harlem, it's no problems</i> Oh, my goodness.\NIt's Cedric's rap group. No! <i>♪ Now everybody bow down\NTo the Kings of Queens ♪</i> No, don't look at that stuff.\NLet's look over here. Dad, I don't wanna go. I don't like jazz. Black improvisational music. It's one of our great contributions\Nto American culture. At least give it a chance, Joey. This is where it all started. This is the moment where\NI fell in love with jazz. Listen to that. See, the tune is just an excuse\Nto bring out the you. And that's why I became a jazz musician. It's not what we're looking for. Wait a minute, that's not how\NI remember it going down. Come back when you have something. - Sorry, Joe.\N- Sorry, Joe. We're looking\Nfor something different. Two, three, four. My life was meaningless. No, no, no. No, I will not accept this. Kid, give me that badge.\NI'm goin' back to my body. Oh, yeah, sure. Here. Unless it becomes an Earth Pass,\NI'm stuck with it. Well, what if I help you\Nturn it into an Earth Pass? Will you give it to me then? Wait... I've never thought of that.\NI'd get to skip life. So, yes! But we gotta get\Nthis thing to change first, and I've never been able\Nto get it to change. Come on.\NI know all about sparks. Because mine is piano. - Really? Nothin' at all?\N- Eh. Oh, no, not jazz, just music.\NI don't like music sounds. It feels like a little too much. Well, I'm not going out like this. Where's that, uh, Hall of Everything? I'll be right back. Don't get ahead of yourself, pal. By the way, why do you sound\Nlike a middle-aged white lady? I don't. - This is all an illusion.\N- Huh? This whole place is a hypothetical. I could sound\Nlike this if I wanted to. Or sound like this instead. I could even sound like you. Life is so unfair. I don't wanna die.\NSomebody call the wambulance. Wah! I just use this voice\Nbecause it annoys people. It's very effective. Don't worry, they're fine. You can't crush a soul here. That's what life on Earth is for. Very witty. Okay. Here we are. This is the Hall of Everything. Whoa! Yes! - Whoa.\N- Congratulations! So, where do you want to start? Come on. Croissants, cakes.\NBaking could be your spark. Yeah! But, um, I don't get it. - Just smell it.\N- Can't, and neither can you. What? You're right. I can't smell. We can't...\NWe can't taste, either? All that stuff is in your body. - No smell, no taste.\N- Or touch. See? Okay, I get it. Moving on. Isn't this exciting? The fire is so pretty. I kinda wanna let it spread. Nope. Hands are hard. How about a librarian?\NThey're cool. Yes, amazing. Who wouldn't like working\Nat a thankless job you're always in danger of\Nlosing due to budget cuts? Though I do like the idea\Nof randomly shushing people. - Look, obviously this...\N- Shh! Oh, yeah, that's good. Meh. Meh. Meh. Meh. Well, I think that's everything. - Sorry.\N- You told me you'd try. I did. I'm telling the truth. If there's one thing I'm not, it's a liar. Unlike Abraham Lincoln. You're really okay being on a penny? Well, of course. It's an honour. Okay, but they put\NAndrew Jackson on the 20. Jackson! What can I say, Joe?\NEarth is boring. Well, what else can we do, then? Because we're running out of time. Yeah, you know,\Ntime's not really a thing here. Time's up! Nice try, Bjorn, but no need to feel bad. 22 here can be a bit of a challenge. Even though I can't feel it,\Nplease don't touch me. So, let's get you to the Great Beyond. Um, wait.\NWe forgot to try breakdancer. Yeah! I think that's gonna be my thing. Poppin' and lockin'. Windmills. Settling my disputes with dance. Can we have one more minute\Nto go back and try breakdancer? Please, Jerry? You look really good today, Jerry. Oh, okay.\NI've never seen 22 this enthused. Good for you, Dr Börgensson. Run. In here. Here it is. Where does it lead? Hey, you ask too many questions. How about you zip it for a minute, m'kay? - And we're going there why?\N- 'Cause I know a guy there. A guy who can help.\NA guy like you. Like me? As in, alive? Wait, are you actually helping me? Joe, I have been here\Nfor who knows how long, and I've never seen anything\Nthat's made me want to live. And then, you come along.\NYour life is sad and pathetic. And you're working so hard\Nto get back to it. Why? I mean, this I gotta see. Okay, let's go. What is this place? You know how when you humans\Nare really into something and it feels like you're in another place? Feels like you're in the zone, right? - Yeah.\N- Well, this is the zone. It's the space between\Nthe physical and spiritual. Wait a minute. I was here.\NToday, doing my audition. This must be where musicians come\Nwhen they get into a flow. Not just musicians. Watch this. O, Romeo, Romeo, wherefore art thou... Line! Oops. Check this out. I have been messing\Nwith this team for decades. <i>And the Knicks\Nlose another one.</i> All right. All right.\NWhere's this guy you know? I gotta get back to my gig. - Okay. I mean, he's usually down here.\N- What the... Make a trade. Make a trade. Make a trade. - What is that?\N- Shh! Make a trade. Make a trade. Run! Make a trade,\Nmake a trade, make a trade! Oh! Ahoy there, fellow astral travellers. Good to see you again, 22. Moonwind, how are ya? On the brink of madness,\Nthanks for asking. Hey, got a request for you. Uh, yeah.\NI'm trying to get back to my body. Can you help me? That's what we do. We are the mystics without borders. Devoted to helping\Nthe lost souls of Earth find their way. I'm Moonwind Stardancer at your service. That's Windstar Dreamermoon,\NDancerstar Windmoon, and that's Dreamerwind Dreamerdreamer. These weirdos are going\Nto help me get back? Just wait. Let's get this lost soul back home. Make a trade. Make a trade. Make a trade. Poor fellow. Some people just can't let go\Nof their own anxieties and obsessions, leaving them lost\Nand disconnected from life. And this is the result. Make a trade. Make a trade. Make a trade. Make a trade. Make a trade? Looks like another hedge fund manager. Now, to reconnect to your earthly body. Whoa. That's me. Thank you. What am I doing with my life? I'm alive! I'm alive! Free yourselves! It's beautiful! Whoa. He got back just like that? So this is all I had to do\Nto get back to my body? Egads, man! Joe, are you dead? No, no. Well, not yet. Can you help me get back? We've never connected an untethered soul\Nback to its body before. But perhaps if we travel to a thin spot... Yes! All aboard! Anchors away! So if your souls are here,\Nwhere are your bodies? Well, on Earth, of course. My body is in a trance in Palawan. I'm playing the Saraswati <i>veena</i> in Tibet. I'm a shamanic healer\Nmeditating in Berkeley, California. Mm-hmm. And let me guess,\Nyou're drumming, chanting, and meditating? Yes. Something like that. I'm in New York City,\Non the corner of 14th and 7th. Oh, yeah, that's right up\Nfrom Tony Tony Tonios. Yes, precisely. And what about you?\NI thought you hated Earth. Yeah, I'm not stuck with a body. So I can go wherever I want. I'm a nobody, get it? We mystics meet in this glorious landscape\Nevery Tuesday. So many of them. Sad. You know,\Nlost souls are not that different from those in the zone. - What?\N- The zone is enjoyable, but when that joy becomes an obsession,\None becomes disconnected from life. Gotta find it. Gotta find it. Gotta find it. For a time, I was a lost soul myself. - Really?\N- Tetris. There you are. We'll have you back in no time. Now, since you don't have\Na connection to your body, you will have to tune back\Ninto your physical surroundings. Close your eyes. Breathe into your crown chakra. Do we really need all this? Yes! Do you have a piano on board?\NI could focus with that. No pianos, Joe. You must focus. Imagine silence. Shh. Now, concentrate on where your body is. Listen for cues. That's it. You're doing it. No peeking.\NMaintain your meditative state or you'll break the connection. Now, see if you can smell\Nand feel where your body is. I hear a heart monitor. I can smell hand sanitiser. <i>Yes. Yes! Good.</i> <i>I think I can feel my feet.</i> Hmm. I feel fur. Did you find a next of kin? I feel fur. Did you hear that? Oh, the therapy cat is working. Am I close?\NWhen can I jump in? Look! There I am. There I am. His heart rate is increasing. I'll get the doctor. Mr Mittens, you stay right there. - What are we waiting for?\N- No, Joe, don't rush this. - It's not the right time.\N- No, it's my time. Wait, not me! I did it.\NI did it! I'm back. What the... No. No. No. No. I'm in the cat? Wait a minute.\NIf I'm in here, then who... - What?\N- You're in my body! - You're in the cat?\N- Wait, wait, that's my body. - I'm in a body! No!\N- Why are you in my body? I don't wanna be a cat.\NI hate cats! Oh, it's disgusting. That Moonwind guy, he messed this up. Doc, you gotta help me.\NThat's my body, but I'm trapped... Oh, no, they can't understand me. They think you're me.\NYou gotta try. Miss Doctor, we have a problem. I'm an unborn soul\Nand I wanna stay at the You Seminar. Yes, well, that drug doesn't\Nseem to be working at all. No, no, no, you don't understand. - I'm not Mr Gardner.\N- Shh! They're gonna think you're nuts. I mean, that I'm nuts. Oh, how did this happen? I fell into your body because\Nit doesn't have a soul. Then why am I in a cat? I don't know! Is there anyone we can call, Mr Gardner? A next of kin or friend? - Tell her no.\N- Uh, no. Can you tell me what day it is? It's the worst day of my life. I don't wanna be here. I hate Earth. Tell you what.\NWe're going to keep you here for observation. Just for a bit. Perhaps our therapy cat can go\Nto his next appointment. Okay. Okay. - You gotta talk to her.\N- Okay. Miss Doctor,\Nthis body's soul is in this cat. Stop talking. So naturally, he wants to stay close. Uh, keep the cat.\NJust get some rest. A lot of it. Okay? I'll come get Mr Mittens in ten minutes. Ten minutes?\NWe gotta get outta here. No way! I am not moving! I can't believe I'm in a body\Non this hellish planet. I have bendy meat sticks. I can feel myself feeling myself. Hey! Focus! Listen to me. We gotta get out of here\Nbefore they take me away. Take you away?\NYou're gonna leave me? No way! That's my body you're in. Okay, do you think you can walk? I don't know! I failed Body Test Drive, like, 436 times. But will you try? Okay. Gotta find Moonwind,\Nhe can fix this. I'm a cat. I can make this. Okay, come on, you're doing great. Keep going. Keep going. I'm just gonna rest here for a minute. No, no, no, no.\NThey'll be back any minute. Come on. Okay! In here! Whoa. Okay, good. Now push the down button. Move your... Nope. Careful. Those fingers are my livelihood. Ugh. Now get in. Phew! Hmm. Hmm. Okay, what did Moonwind say? He said on the corner of 14th and 7th. Yeah, that's Chelsea.\NNear Jackson Square Park. Exactly. Wait.\NHow do you know all that? It's all in this stupid brain of yours. Hey, hey, hey, stay outta there. Oh, relax. There's not much here. Jazz, jazz, more jazz. Oh, and someone named Lisa.\NWho's that? Uh, never mind. I, um... It's all happening too fast, you know. Let's just take a minute and, um... Come on, let's go.\NThey could be here any second. Don't worry, it's okay.\NJust keep walking. Aah! No, don't stop.\NWhat are you doing? This is New York City. You don't stop in the middle\Nof the street. Go, go, go. Oh, no. 22. 22! 22. Oh, no.\NOh, no. 22. 22. 22! 22! 22, I didn't know I had claws, okay? Look, I'm sorry.\NBut come on, let's go. No way. I am staying right here\Nuntil your stupid body dies. Which will happen any minute now\Nbecause your stomach is earthquaking. Yeah, this place is worse than I thought. It's loud, and bright, and... Hmm.\NWhat is that in my nose? That's smell. And if you think that's good,\Njust imagine what it tastes like. Hmm. Go on. It's so good! It's, uh... It's not horrible. Good. You can eat on the way.\NLet's go. Or you just take a few minutes. Sure. Hmm. Strange,\NI don't feel so angry anymore. That's great.\NReady to find Moonwind? Maybe. I'm telling you, Joe,\Nit's pronounced yee-row. Yeah, but in New York,\Nwe call them gyros. It's Greek. No, I got in a fight\Nwith Archimedes about this. He said it's... - Yee-row.\N- Yo-yo. - Yee-row.\N- YOLO. - Yee-row.\N- Sergio? Yee-row! I miss that guy. This is 14th and 7th. That's gotta be him. Moonwind, you gotta help me. Joe! You made it into your body. No, he didn't. That is my body. You're in a cat? That's marvellous! Hey, Moonwimp! That sign won't spin by itself, hear me? But, Marge, look!\NI put this man's soul in a cat. Who cares? And you! We only have room for\None weirdo here, so, scram! Get back to work! No one understands my art. Moonwind, listen, I gotta get out of here and back in there. Well, we'll have to perform an old-fashioned astral\Ntransmigration displacement. - A what?\N- It's simply a way to get your souls back where they belong. And it's a glorious ritual, indeed, full of chanting, dancing,\Nand best of all, bongos. I need to be at The Half Note by 7:00,\Nso this needs to happen right now. Whoa, whoa, whoa! Not so fast. You must wait for another thin spot to open between Earth\Nand the astral plane. And that won't occur until Orcus moves\Ninto the house of Gemini. When is that? Well, the government calls it 6:30. Look, I'll meet you at The Half Note. 6:30? You serious? I'll gather all\Nthe necessary provisions... I said, get out of here! Go! See you\Nat The Half Note at 6:30! I'll take care of everything! And stay away! Sure are a lot of Garcias in here. You're out there somewhere, little soul, and I'm gonna find ya. All right, this is the last snack. I can barely fit into my pants as it is. 6:30 is cutting it close. Too close. We gotta get back to my place\Nand get you cleaned up and... Ahh! We gotta hail a cab.\NHold your hand out. Hold it up and out. Man, this would be hard\Neven if I wasn't wearing a hospital gown. Go, go, go!\NJust run to that one. Is that Teach? Mm, pepperoni. Aah, Dorothea Williams saw me. What am I gonna do?\NShe's gonna think I'm crazy. Maybe you should call her up and tell her that we're not crazy. I've only been a person for an hour,\Nand even I know that's a bad idea. I just gotta get back in my body\Nand really bring it tonight. How come this part is stinky\Nbut this part smells fine? Never mind.\NJust put those pants on. Sheesh, I can't believe I've been walking around in this city\Nwith no pants on. I don't even wanna be here, remember? I don't want you here either. I just... I just wanna get back to my body, then get back to the club. What's the matter with you? Uh... I don't know.\NIt's the sun. It's just so... My phone! Um... Okay, your clothes\Nare rumbling again. Curley! Uh... No, no. Oops. <i>Hey, Mr G, it's Curley.\NUm...</i> <i>I hope you're doin' okay.</i> <i>Dorothea freaked out when she saw you,\Nand she called this other guy, Robert.</i> <i>He's got the gig now. I'm sorry.</i> No, no, no. <i>Look, honestly,</i> <i>your class was the only reason\NI went to school at all.</i> <i>Like, I owe you a lot.</i> <i>So, here's the plan.</i> <i>Clean yourself up, put on a killer suit,</i> <i>and get to the club early.</i> <i>I'm gonna try and talk to her.</i> <i>Just make sure you show up\Nlooking like a million bucks, all right?</i> <i>I hope I see you, man.\NAll right. Peace.</i> Oh! I can get the gig back, 22. I need your help. I have a suit. I'm gonna need you to try it on. No, no, no. And then I can line\Nmy hair up a little bit, - and I can...\N- Nope. No way, no how. 22! - Mr Gardner?\N- Ah! It's Connie.\NShe's here for her lesson. - What do I do?\N- I can hear you! Just tell her that you can't do it today. Hi, Connie. Sorry, but Joe can't do it today. - You're Joe!\N- I mean, me. Me can't do it today. Good. Now let's go\Ncheck out that suit. I came to tell you that I quit. Quit? We don't have time for this.\NThe suit is in the closet. Band is a stupid waste of time. This kid is talking sense. What are you doing? Here, I quit.\NI think jazz is pointless. Oh, yeah, jazz is definitely pointless. Hey! In fact, all of school is a waste of time. Of course. Like my mentor,\NGeorge Orwell, used to say, "State sponsored education "is like the rattling of a stick\Ninside a swill bucket." Yeah! The ruling class's core\Ncurriculum stifles dissent. It's the oldest trick in the book. What are you talkin' about? She doesn't care about any of that. I've been saying that\Nsince the third grade. You know, you seem really smart. What is your position on pizza? - Uh, I like it?\N- Me, too! What are you doing? I'd rather hang with Connie. What? Come back here!\NYou open this... Um, I think your cat wants to get out. Ugh, he thinks he knows everything. 22! Don't you walk away from me. Come here right now. I'm gonna go in\Nand I'mma scratch up the sofa. Oh, wait a minute, that's my sofa. You really got things figured out, Connie. I'd better give this back.\NIt belongs to the school. Sure. You know, I really am glad\Nthere's someone else who sees how ridiculous this place is. You're right to quit.\NI learned about quitting... You know what, Mr G? I was practising this one thing yesterday and maybe you can listen to it\Nand tell me to quit after, okay? Uh, okay. Wow. You really love this. Yeah. So, maybe I'd better stick with it? Yeah. Bye, Mr G. See you next week! 22! So, Connie came here to quit, but then she didn't. 22, forget about that. Listen. I need to know this, Joe.\NWhy didn't she quit? Because she loves to play. She might say she hates everything,\Nbut trombone is her thing. She's good at it. Maybe trombone is her spark, I don't know. Please. If I'm gonna get this gig back,\NI need your help. Okay. Really? I'll help you,\Nbut I wanna try a few things. 'Cause I don't know, some of it's not as boring\Nas it is at the You Seminar, and if Connie can find\Nsomething she loves here, maybe I can, too. - Great!\N- So, what do we do first? - This water hurts!\N- It's okay. You just have to turn the other knob. Oh, okay, that's better. And I wouldn't be mad if you put a little lotion\Non me when you're done. I washed your butt for you. Ah! Spicy! Spicy! You five will be insecure. And you 12 will be self-absorbed. We really should stop sending\Nso many through that pavilion. Found him! See that, everybody? Who figured out why the count's off? That's right, Terry did. It's Terrytime. - Wow. Nice work.\N- Well, who is it? Right. Uh... Joe Gardner is his name. Looks like he's back down on Earth. That's not good. That... That's the mentor\Nwe set up with 22. All right, all right.\NEasy on the hysterics. Terry's got this under control.\NI'll handle it. How? I'll go down there and get him. Set the count right, lickety-split. Okay, whoa.\NAre you sure that's a good idea? Look, you all are the ones who beefed it. I'm trying to un-beef it. But you cannot be seen. By anyone. Don't worry. I'll make sure\Nno one else sees me. I'll move among the shadows, like a ninja. Please, just do it quickly and quietly. And also quickly.\NAnd quietly as well. This won't be a disaster, that's for sure. Mm. Trusty old brown suit.\NStill a perfect fit. It's a little tight in the back-here part. It'll loosen. Sit down. I'm a cat. I'll do it. You couldn't call an elevator, remember? No way. I just need to line me up.\NNow be still. Uh, it's like a little tiny chainsaw. - Don't move.\N- I'm not moving. You're moving. Oh, no! Don't worry, I'm okay. Oh, no, no, no! My hair!\NMy hair is not okay! This is a disaster! We gotta fix this. Right now. - Okay. How?\N- We gotta go see Dez. Great. Who's Dez? Yo, Ian, man, how you get that big peanut head?\NWhat happened to you? Man, shut up, man.\NYou know I'm sensitive about that. Dez is the guy in the back. He can fix this. Talk about havin' a spark. This guy was born to be a barber. But I can't pass for you\Nin front of all your friends. Dez is the only one that I talk to. We usually talk about jazz, but this time, just sit there,\Nget the cut, and get out. Hey, Joe. What are you\Ndoing here on a weekday? You didn't call for an appointment, man.\NIt's gonna be a while. Ah, I was afraid of this.\NGo ahead and sit down. Oh, my Lord. You gotta wait, son.\NThis is an emergency. What? That ain't cool, Dez. You could always let Harold cut your hair. His chair's wide open. Nah. I can wait. Joe, get your butt in this chair now. Should I even ask you how this happened? - The cat did it.\N- Stop sounding insane. I mean, um, I was distracted getting ready to play with\NDorothea Williams tonight. Dorothea Williams?\NThat's big time, Joe. Congratulations! Joe ain't getting no gig, Dez. You know he Mr Close-But-No-Cigar. This guy. Joe, ignore him.\NNow let's fix you up. You keeping that cat on your lap? Is it okay that I do that? Suit yourself. You're the boss. - I am?\N- When you're in this chair, yeah, you are. So can I have one of those? Uh... Sure, Joe. Cool. Mmm. I like being in the chair. Hey, get your head in the game. Little chainsaw. You need to settle down.\NIf you keep this... Look, I can deal with some freaky stuff, but if this cat don't chill, we're gonna have to put it outside. Well, what's it gonna be, kitty? Meow. Sometimes, change is good. You have been rocking\Nthat same style for a while. Well, Dez, for hundreds of years,\NI've had no style at all. You can say that again. Mmm. But then my life changed. Oh, yeah? What happened? I was existing as a theoretical construct in a hypothetical way station between life and death. I heard that. And by the time\NI got to mentor number 266, I was seriously asking, like,\Nwhat is all the fuss about? Like, is all this living\Nreally worth dying for? You know what I mean? I never knew you had\Nsuch an interesting education, Joe. I just thought you went to music school. And another thing,\Nthey say you're born to do something, but how do you figure out\Nwhat that thing is? I mean, what if you pick up\Nthe wrong thing? Or somebody else's thing, you know? - Then you're stuck.\N- Been there before. I'll take one of those. I wouldn't call myself stuck, but I never planned on\Ncuttin' heads for a livin'. Wait, but you were born to be a barber,\Nweren't you? I wanted to be a veterinarian. So, why didn't you do that? I was plannin' to\Nwhen I got out of the Navy. Then my daughter got sick, and barber school\Nis a lot cheaper than veterinarian school. Well, that's too bad. You're stuck as a barber\Nand now you're unhappy. Whoa, whoa, slow your roll there, Joe. I'm happy as a clam, my man. Not everyone can be Charles Drew\Ninventing blood transfusions. Or me, playing piano\Nwith Dorothea Williams. I know. You are not all that. Anyone could play in a band\Nif they wanted to. Don't pay Paul any mind. People like him just bring\Nother people down so they can make themselves feel better. Oh, I get it. He's just criticising me to cover up\Nthe pain of his own failed dreams. You cut deep, Joe. I wonder why sitting in this chair\Nmakes me want to tell you things, Dez. That's the magic of the chair.\NThat's why I love this job. I get to meet interesting folks like you, make them happy, and make them handsome. Wow! Am I crazy or do I look younger? I may not have invented\Nblood transfusions, but I am most definitely savin' lives. I don't know about\Nthis crazy cat guy thing, man, but it is nice to finally talk to you\Nabout something other than jazz, Joe. Huh. How come we, um, never\Ntalked about your life before? You never asked. But I'm glad you did this time. - Looking good, brother.\N- Have a great show. I grabbed\Na couple of road lollies. <i>Dr Charma, call 3-1-6-2.</i> Mm. Mm-hmm. Mm. Oh. Julia Child didn't succeed\Ntill she was 49. Hey, Paul. Here, have a lollipop. Oh, yeah, thanks.\NThanks, man. There you are. No hard feelings, right? All right. Just friends. Just friends goofing on each other.\NAll right. Okay. Goodbye, Paul. Come to Terry. Gotcha! Thought you could cheat the universe? Well, you thought wrong. I'm the accountant,\Nand I'm here to bring you in... Oh, whoa...\NYou're not Joe Gardner. My mistake. We'll just get you back into\Nyour meat suit. There you go. No harm, no foul. Oh, boy. Look, uh, fella, I'm thinking there's no reason we can't keep this little\Nincident between us, eh? Mistakes happen.\NAnd, uh, it's not your time. Unless you keep eating those processed foods,\Nam I right? But seriously, stay away\Nfrom those processed foods. You know what,\Nyou did all right back there. How did you know how to deal with Paul? I didn't. I just let out the me. Hey, like you said about jazz.\NI was jazzing. First of all,\N"jazzing" is not a word. And second, music and life\Noperate by very different rules. It says take one. Don't... Or do. Okay. Fine. "Man with a van." I got a few in case we need a lot of vans. Uh-huh. Now, let's get back to the plan. We go to The Half Note\Nand wait there for Moonwind. It's around 4:00 p.m. now... You know what? You are really getting good\Nat using those legs. Why don't you try runnin'? Hey! I made a song.\NI'm jazzing. Okay, enough of the jazzing\Nand everything like that. We need to get somewhere.\NNow, I... - That tickles.\N- Uh, what are you doing? Whoops. I got it. Would you hurry up? Okay. You were right.\NThese pants are loosening. Oh, no, no, no. Don't let people see your butt! - It's your butt.\N- It doesn't matter whose butt... Take off the jacket.\NTie it around your waist. Quick! Cover the butt! What are we gonna do? I can't find a tailor this late... Oh, no. We're gonna have to go to Mom's. Okay. No, no, no, you don't understand. Mom doesn't know about this gig. And she's not gonna like it. Okay. We don't have any other choice. Okay. She's the only one that can fix this. - Okay.\N- Stop saying "okay"! We gotta catch the subway across town.\NCome on. Okay... Got it. My mom doesn't know\Nanything about the gig, and I wanna keep it that way, okay? Right, because she thinks\Nyou're a failure. - What?\N- I didn't say that. You did. Up here. Uh, look, my mom has her own\Ndefinition of what success is, and being a professional musician\Nisn't it. So, let me see, I need the suit fixed\Nfor a, uh, school band recital. I'm not looking forward to this,\Nbut there's no reason she needs to know... <i>♪ We shall come around\NTo touch eyes again</i> <i>♪ If love is the foundation</i> <i>♪ If the purpose be\NTo recycle life</i> <i>♪ I promise you\NI'll bring us to one</i> <i>♪ Bleeding heart in the end now</i> <i>♪ Though we're apart</i> I don't know.\NAll the times I've been so close to getting to my dreams, something always gets in the way. You know what I mean? <i>♪ How true lovin' began</i> He's good. And I've heard music before,\Nbut I've never felt like this inside. Of course, you love music now,\Nbecause you're me. Let's go. <i>♪ Now, love</i> Let's go. <i>♪ Love</i> <i>♪ Love, love</i> <i>♪ Talkin' about love</i> <i>♪ Love</i> <i>♪ Love ♪</i> Whoa! Hey, take it easy, eh? I'm sorry. Don't worry about it. It's the subway.\NIt does that to some people. - Does what?\N- It wears you down. It stinks. It's hot. It's crowded. Every day the same thing,\Nday in and day out. But once I get on the stage tonight, all my troubles are going to be fixed. You're gonna see a brand-new Joe Gardner. Where'd you get that? Under the seat.\NCan you believe it? It's still half-full. All right, remember, I need the suit fixed for a band recital.\NGot it? - Joey! Oh, baby boy...\N- Joey! - Oh, I'm so proud of you.\N- ...we heard the news. Oh, crap. She knows. Your momma's in the back. - You gotta go in there.\N- No, I don't want to. You have to.\NWe need the suit fixed. You forgetting something, Joey? - What?\N- Kiss her. I always kiss Melba when I see her. Just do it. No, no, no. Not on the lips. Joey!\NWhat has gotten into you, boy? Let him finish. Cougar. I knew it. I'll take another kiss\Nwhen you get back, Joey. So much for being done\Nchasing after gigs, huh? I hope that cat isn't supposed to be\Nsome kind of peace offering. Come. Come on. Just say you rescued it. Um, no. It's mine. I rescued it. Hmm. Too bad you can't rescue your career. Oh. Just ask her nicely\Nif she can fix my suit. So, Mom, is there any way\Nyou can fix this? Whoa! I don't need to see that. I know. Embarrassing, right? So, you'll fix it? - No.\N- What? How long are you going\Nto keep doing this, Joey? You tell me you're going\Nto accept the full-time position... Here it comes. ...and instead,\NI hear you've taken another gig. Tell her that this one is different. This one's different! Does this gig have a pension?\NHealth insurance? No? Then it's the same as the other ones. It's like you can't even\Nbe truthful with me anymore. Fine, we'll get the suit\Noff the rack somewhere. My mom has never understood\Nwhat I'm trying to do with my life. Fine, we'll get the suit\Noff the rack somewhere. My mom has never understood what I'm trying to do with my life. - 22!\N- What did you just say? Oof. Can I run away now,\Nlike you usually do? No. Not this time.\NRepeat after me. Mom, I know we've had some rough times, but you're right, I can't be truthful with you. Because it seems like\Nno matter what I do, you disapprove. Look, I know you love playing. Then how come except for church,\Nyou're the happiest when I don't? I finally land the gig of my life\Nand you're upset. You didn't see how tough\Nbeing a musician was on your father. I don't want to see\Nyou struggle like that. So Dad could pursue his dreams,\Nand I can't? Your father had me. Most times,\Nthis shop is what paid the bills. So when I'm gone, who's gonna pay yours? Music is all I think about. From the moment I wake up in the morning to the moment I fall asleep at night. You can't eat dreams for breakfast, Joey. Then I don't want to eat. This isn't about my career, Mom. It's my reason for living. And I know Dad felt the same way. I'm just afraid\Nthat if I died today, that my life would've amounted to nothing. Joey. Oh. Let's make this work instead. That's my dad's suit. Lulu. Melba. Bring your good scissors in here.\NWe got work to do. Wow. This feels really nice. - You look marvellous.\N- It fits perfectly. You see how I did that? That is one fine wool suit,\Nif I do say so myself. - Can I try on that?\N- Of course you can. Just handsome. Thank you, uh, Mom. Ray would have been so proud of you, baby. Like I've always been. You heard me, right? The suit is wool, not polyester. So, don't go putting that cat\Non your shoulders again. Yes, ma'am! Oh,\Nthere's a nice little taper there. Thanks, Mom. Oh, that was amazin'. You know what that felt like?\NIt felt like jazz. Yeah, you were jazzing. Ha-ha. Okay, jazzing. I'm telling you, Joe. You really should call Lisa again. I don't really have time\Nfor a relationship right now, 22. Oh, busy right now? Wanna wait till you die a second time? Cool, cool, cool. I can't believe\NI'm getting romantic advice from an unborn soul. I can think of worse. There it is. We made it!\NThis is going to work. Whoa! I can't believe how good I look. The suit, the cut.\NJust look at me. - Ooh, just turn a little bit right there.\N- Like this? - Angle the shoulders, and...\N- Oh, hey, who's that? - And from this side.\N- That's it. What? Who's back here? - Still me. Uh-huh.\N- That's a winner. Right? This can't be happenin'.\NNow, I'm not gonna believe this. The Half Note. He made you pay for dinner? Yeah... - So, you ready?\N- Huh? To go home. I bet you're ready to get off\Nof this stinky rock, huh? What do you think of Earth, anyway? I always said it was dumb. But... I mean... Just look at what I found. Your mom sewed your suit\Nfrom this cute spool. When I was nervous, Dez gave me this. A guy on the subway yelled at me.\NIt was scary. But I kind of liked that, too. Truth is, I've always worried that maybe there's something\Nwrong with me. You know? Maybe I'm not good enough for living. But then you showed me\Nabout purpose and passion, and maybe sky-watching can be my spark. Or walking.\NI'm really good at walking. Those really aren't purposes, 22. That's just regular old living. But, hey, when you get back\Nto the You Seminar, you can give it an honest try. No, but I've been at the You Seminar\Nfor thousands of years and I have never felt this close. Joe! Who's ready to go home? Moonwind. The stars are almost in alignment. All right. I'll have you back\Nin your bodies in no time. No. I've gotta find it here, on Earth. This is my only chance to find my spark. 22, you're only loving this stuff\Nbecause you're in my body. You can find your own thing to love\Nwhen you get back to the You Seminar. Now, come on,\NI need my body back. Now! No. I'm in the chair. - 22!\N- Leave me alone! I'm trying to find my purpose! 22, you come back here! 22! Mr Mittens. Oh. {\an8}There they are. You come back here right now! You stole my body! It's your time to go, Joe Gardner. Oh, no, you don't. Gotcha! No, no, no. No, no! I was gonna play with Dorothea Williams! And I was about to find my spark! Find your spark?\NMy life was finally going to change! You promised, but you wouldn't\Neven give me five minutes! I lost everything because of you! Joe! You cheated. Found him. - Joe Gardner.\N- You're back! Terry, you found them. No need to thank me. It's so nice to have\Neverything back in order, and... 22 got her pass? - Oh, my goodness.\N- 22! You got an Earth Pass! This is amazing! I knew you could do it. This is cray cray. But what...\NWhat filled in the last box? I'll tell you what filled it in. I did! It was my spark that changed that badge. She only got that because\Nshe was living my life in my body. - I was...\N- Come on, Mr Gardner. Joe, it's time for you to accompany 22 to the Earth portal. Give you a chance to say goodbye. Of course.\NIt's standard procedure. Just hold on a minute.\NI get to set the count right. Terry, you have done a super job. We'll take it from here. You're amazing. Well, thank you. Terrytime. Go ahead, you two. You don't know. You can't be sure why my pass changed. Come on, 22.\NThink about it. You hated music until you were in my body. You hated everything until you were me. I hope you enjoy it. Uh... I have to ask,\Nhow the Dickens did you do it? Get that Earth Pass to change? Oh. You know what, I...\NI just let her walk a mile in my shoes, you could say. Well, it worked. Yeah. Well, you should probably\Nget going to the Great Beyond. Hey, um, we never found out\Nwhat 22's purpose was. - Excuse me?\N- You know, her, uh, spark. Her purpose. Was it music?\NBiology? Walking? We don't assign purposes.\NWhere did you get that idea? Because I have piano. It's what I was born to do.\NThat's my spark. A spark isn't a soul's purpose. Oh, you mentors and your passions. Your purposes. Your meanings of life.\NSo basic. No, no, it... Wow. It is music.\NMy spark is music. I... I know it is. I'm no good. I got no purpose. No purpose. No purpose. Mr G? Curley, I made it.\NI'm ready to go. You're too late, man. Let me talk to Dorothea. No, no, no, man.\NShe don't play that. These rappers act like...\NWho let this lunatic in here? Listen, you gotta give me another chance. This is my band.\NI decide who plays. And if you don't go with me, you'll be making the biggest\Nmistake of your career. Oh, yeah? Why's that? My only purpose on this planet is to play. It's what I was meant to do.\NAnd nothing's gonna stop me. Well, aren't you an arrogant one? I guess you really are a jazz player. Tell Robert he's out. For now. Nice suit. Get ready, Joe Gardner,\Nyour life is about to start. Welcome to the quartet, Teach. That's my Joey! - What a show!\N- That last solo was brilliant. That was amazing! I'm not gonna cover\Nthat bridge for you again. - Whoo! Later, Mr G.\N- Congratulations. You did great. We love you. I'm so proud of you, Joey. Gotta get to bed. We old. You play 100 shows,\Nand one of them is killer. You don't get many like tonight. Yeah. So, uh, what happens next? We come back tomorrow night\Nand do it all again. What's wrong, Teach? It's just I've been waiting\Non this day for my entire life. I thought I'd feel different. I heard this story about a fish. He swims up to this older fish and says, "I'm trying to find this thing\Nthey call the ocean." "The ocean?" says the older fish. "That's what you're in right now." "This?" says the young fish.\N"This is water. "What I want is the ocean." See you tomorrow. - Hey, man.\N- Sorry. <i>Maybe sky-watching can be my spark.</i> <i>Or walking.\NI'm really good at walking.</i> <i>Those really aren't purposes, 22.</i> <i>That's just regular old living.</i> - Joe?\N- Huh? Joe! Good heavens, man.\NWhat are you doing in the zone? Moonwind. I messed up.\NI need to find 22. I'm afraid she's become a lost soul. - What?\N- I'll explain on the way. When neither of you returned\Nto The Half Note, I suspected something had gone wrong. <i>I came back here,\Nand that's when I spotted her.</i> Lost souls are obsessed by something\Nthat disconnects them from life. And now that 22 has technically lived,\Nshe's become one of them. - There!\N- Good show. 22! - Ready the net.\N- I'm on it. She's got us! Moonwind! A captain always\Ngoes down with the ship. It has been a... 22! Come back, 22. It's me, Joe. Easy, 22, easy. I just came back to give you this. Easy. 22, listen. Come back! And for correcting\Nour absent-minded mistakes and setting the count right, we are awarding you, Terry, this trophy.\NAs you requested. I am happy to accept this\Nvery special award I requested, but that I absolutely deserve. Joe Gardner? And I'll just take that back. Hey. Oi, noob!\NYou're not where you belong. Uh... 22, stop.\NI have something to tell you. Stop that. No. 22! Whoa, watch out! Take it easy. - There, there.\N- There's no need to be afraid. Don't worry. Calm down. You have to stop running. Please. 22, stop. 22, I was wrong. Please, will you listen?\NYou are ready to live, 22. I'm not good enough. Nope. No. Nothing. I just need to\Nfill out that last box. 22! You're dishonest. All you make are bad decisions. You are unwise and you won't\Nmake it in the world. You're so selfish. No one would ever want to be around you. Loser. Oh, the world needs remarkable people and you are the least\Nremarkable soul I've ever met. You'll never find your spark. Imbecile. I cannot help you. 22! I just need to fill out that last box. I'm not good enough at all. You will never find your spark. There's no point. Those aren't purposes,\Nyou idiot. That's just regular old living. This is a waste of time. You only got that badge\Nbecause you were in my body. That's why you ruin everything. Because you have no purpose. No, no, no. There's no point. You'll never find your spark. Because you have no purpose! I'm not good. Nope. Nothing. I just need to fill\Nout that last box. I give up. You ready? Huh? To come live. I'm scared, Joe. I'm not good enough. Anyway, I never got my spark. Yes, you did. Your spark isn't your purpose. That last box fills in\Nwhen you're ready to come live. And, the thing is you're pretty great at jazzing. But, Joe, this means you won't get to... It's okay. I already did. Now it's your turn. I'll go with you. You know you can't do that. I know.\NBut I'll go as far as I can. Hey! Take a look! Wow! Mr Gardner? Yes? Do you have a moment? I think I'm speaking for all the Jerrys\Nwhen I say thank you. For what? We're in the business of inspiration, Joe, but it's not often\Nwe find ourselves inspired. Huh. Really? So, we all decided to give you\Nanother chance. Hopefully, you will watch\Nwhere you walk from now on. But what about Terry? We worked it out with Terry. Mm. That's weird. Hey, Terry, what's that over there? Look immediately. What? What are you talking about? - Oh, nothing. You were saying?\N- Hmm? Were you even talking?\NI can't remember. Never mind. Well? Thanks. So what do you think you'll do? How are you gonna spend your life? I'm not sure. <i>But I do know...</i> <i>I'm going to live every minute of it.</i> <i>♪ Rappin Ced is the name</i> <i>♪ And you should get it right</i> <i>♪ Blowin' up on the scene like Dynomite</i> <i>♪ Joey G on the keys\NKP and Tommy with me</i> <i>♪ How much you wanna bet?</i> <i>♪ We can take the whole city</i> <i>♪ You see us stylin' from the island</i> <i>♪ All the way to BK</i> <i>♪ Boogie down made the sound\NBut we took it away</i> <i>♪ I go to Harlem it's no problems\NIf you know what I mean</i> {\an8}<i>♪ Now everybody bow down to\NThe Kings of Queens ♪</i> Hey!
