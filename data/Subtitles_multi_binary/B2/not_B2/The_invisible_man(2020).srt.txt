Adrian? Come on. <i>Zeus, I'm sorry.\NI can't take you with me.</i> I'm sorry. <i>Shit. I'm not gonna leave you\Nwith that thing on. Okay.</i> <i>Come here. It's okay.\NGood boy.</i> Come here.\NThere you go. Come here. Fuck! Emily, where are you? Shit. Cecilia,\Nwhat is going on? Are you okay? I'll explain later. Just go, Emily. Go! Open the fucking door,\NCecilia! What is happening? <i>- Open the door!\N- No!</i> <i>Open the fucking door!</i> Open the door! <i>- Open the fucking door!\N- I'm going! I'm going!</i> Cecilia! Get back here! Jesus! <i>Get back here now! You\Ncan't do this! Get back here!</i> Cee. How long have you been up? Few hours.\NCan't sleep. Cee, you know, if you close your eyes\Nand you lie down, that usually helps. Um, don't think being tired gets\Nyou out of our little deal, now. I swore to your sister I'd get\Nyou to step outside my house. Hey, Cee. He's not out there. I promise. I'm sorry, I'm just... I'm not ready yet. Hey, it's okay, Cee. That's the furthest you've gone\Nsince you've been here. Okay? So as far as I'm concerned,\Nyou just walked on the moon. I can't work\Nwith this damn thing. It's all right.\NI got it. I got it. <i>Do I know you?\NDo I owe you money?</i> A lot.\NA lot? I told y'all about running\Nup on me in my house. <i>Hey. Cee, tell her\Nshe can't take you back.</i> We're keeping you. What are you doing here, Emily? Well, it's nice\Nto see you too, sis. I'm gonna go\Nsee what Sydney's up to. Just... Yeah.\NMmm. This is not fair. I asked you not to come over. <i>He knows where you live.\NHe will follow you.</i> Yes. Well, I have some news... There is no news\Nthat justifies this. <i>Okay. I have a plan,\Nand I just...</i> I need you to go along with it. And just not be in control\Nfor one second. I'm not trying\Nto control you, boo. I'm desperately trying to tell you that\Nyou don't need to cut me off anymore. Because he's dead. What? What? Hey. What did he do to you? Can you talk to me? It just doesn't make any sense. <i>He was... He was in complete\Ncontrol of everything, you know?</i> Including me. He controlled how I looked\Nand what I wore and what I ate. And then it was controlling\Nwhen I left the house and what I said. And eventually, what I thought. And if... If he didn't like what he\Nassumed I was thinking... He... <i>- He would...\N- He'd what?</i> <i>He would...\NHe would hit you?</i> Amongst other things. He wanted to have a baby. And I knew that if we did that, that I would never be\Nable to get away from him, so I took birth control\Nwithout him knowing it. But, um, that can\Nonly go on for so long, <i>so I called you.</i> Hey. You're here with us now. And you're safe. He's gone. I'm not telling you to aim low. I'm just saying, explore\Nmore than one option, okay? Don't limit your choices to just\None school in the whole country. But that one school is my\Ngoal. Parsons is my goal. Yeah, I told you\Nto have goals. Plural. I think it's important\Nto have goals, James. Hey. Look at you,\Ngetting out into the world. Yo, by next year, you'll\Nmake it across the street. Mmm.\NMmm-mmm. <i>Uh, hey, Cee.\NSomething came for you.</i> No one knows I'm here. So, who's it from? Thank you both for coming in. As the appointed attorney representing\Nmy late brother's discretionary trust, I'm required to enact\Nhis final wishes. And he stipulated\Nthat I do this in person. He wanted me to read\Na prepared statement. "Cecilia," "although our relationship\Nwas far from perfect," "I at least thought\Nwe had built up enough trust" "that you would talk to me\Nrather than running away from..." No. No! Sorry, you're not allowed\Nto do that. I'm required to read this. She's not required to listen. Email me a copy,\Nand we will read it. You bet. I'm just trying to do my job. Your job is to explain the\Nmoney you mentioned on the phone. I mentioned Cecilia, specifically,\Nis named in Adrian's trust. That is why we're sitting here. Yes. For the same reason so many women in\NAdrian's life got close to him, his money. If there was a chance of\Nphysically being close to him, we would not be here\Nfor any amount of money. You are physically close to him. He's in that urn over there. And as per his final wishes, you're getting $5 million, estate and income tax free. Now, the money will be staggered\Nin installments of $100,000 each month for the next\Nfour years or so. Contingent, of course,\Non the fine print. You can't commit a crime,\Netcetera. Normally, I would have a\N120-day contestability period, but I'm gonna waive my\Nrights in that regard. So, as soon as I have your signature\Nand your banking information, I can start releasing the funds. Okay,\Nyou can come in now. Oh.\NOh. Hey. Wait. Where you at? Okay.\NOkay. Can we look now? Yes, you can look. Ta-da!\NOh. Wow. Thanks, Cee. <i>Wow, that's nice.\NLook at that.</i> <i>A ladder?</i> Excuse you? I know I didn't\Nhear you just say that. I meant to say,\N"Thank you." Uh-huh. You're welcome. Well, I knew you needed a new one,\Nand that one just... That has to go. <i>That's so nice of you, Cee.\NThank you so much.</i> <i>That's very sweet of you.\NThank you.</i> <i>I just... I wanted to thank you\Nfor, you know, letting me stay here</i> and for taking such\Ngood care of me, so... And Sydney can also use ladders. Don't think\NI'm helping you paint. I wouldn't even bother\Nto ask you. No, not for, like, painting,\Nobviously, but just for a lot of things. <i>You climb them to get things.\NLike... Like, stuff like that.</i> <i>That's so strange.</i> God, I wish you had,\Nlike... Oh, wait! <i>You could totally use the ladder...\NYeah. A ladder to climb up.</i> The ladder's cool. This happened to just\Npop up here by itself... <i>Convenient.</i>\NWow. What is it? <i>It has my name on it.\NThat's weird.</i> And it looks like your\Nhandwriting. I don't... You sure it's weird? I just got a ladder, so I\Ndon't know what... <i>Let's see.\NA cool ladder is all.</i> It's a new bank\Naccount, um, with your name on it. And I'm gonna put $10,000 in it\Nevery month for the rest of the year. I called the account\N"Parsons." You're going to\Nfashion school, kid. Hey, whoa, Cee... <i>That's... That's too much, Cee. Come on.\NAre you sure you can do that?</i> Let me put it this way... She can probably\Ngo to grad school, too. <i>I'm going to Parsons.</i> <i>You're going to Parsons.\NYou're going to Parsons.</i> Oh, my God. Oh. <i>Wait, no. We gotta...\NWe gotta celebrate.</i> And I don't want TV dinners,\Nmicrowave nothing. Oh! <i>It's like, I guess... We don't have\Nanything at all to celebrate with.</i> I don't know why you dancing. You can't have none because\Nyou're not 21. Yes, I can. <i>Come on. Just, like,\Na little bit.</i> He said the other day\Nthat I was mature for my age. <i>That's right.\NHe did.</i> A mature child. <i>I heard you say that.\NI remember.</i> <i>Hold up. This ain't fair.\NTwo against one.</i> I'm just an innocent man trying\Nto do right. Are you scared? <i>This is abuse. I'm a cop.\NYou realize I'm a cop?</i> I got him.\NHey! Oh, no. <i>I got him, Sydney!\NI got him!</i> I'll protect you! <i>Morning.\NYou want some breakfast?</i> No. No, I gotta go. You know, I'm a little\Nhungover, believe it or not. Oh. Me too. Champagne does that\Nto me every time. We're getting old,\NCee. We old. These winter mornings\Nare killing me. <i>All right, look, I'm out of here.\NUm, I'll be back around 7:00.</i> Okay.\NAll right. Oh. Uh, Cee?\NHmm? You mind getting Sydney up? She's actually pretty excited,\Nthanks to you. She, uh... She might need a little help\Nstaying focused. You got it. <i>Syd, come on, girl.\NYou're gonna be late.</i> Shit! Shit! Shit! Shit! <i>No, no, no.\NDon't use water.</i> Excuse me. Sorry. Oh. Wow. You did that.\NYeah. You think we can salvage\Nit? No. No?\NNo. Sorry. James? James! James! James! James! <i>Yeah. What\Nhappened? What happened? What?</i> <i>I saw something right there.\NRight there.</i> <i>There were footprints.\NI saw it!</i> You saw footprints? <i>Yes, I saw... On the sheets!\NI saw it, right there!</i> I saw them. On the sheet? I saw it. <i>There's someone in here.\NThere was someone in here.</i> Syd, put that stupid thing away. You're the one\Nwho bought it for me! Who you gonna spray? Who? James, I saw it. I swear. Hey, Cee. Adrian will haunt you\Nif you let him. Don't let him. Now, you should try\Nand get some sleep. You have an important\Njob interview tomorrow, and I don't want\Nthe memory of this... That... <i>This person to ruin it.\NOkay?</i> Okay. Sorry. After Cal Poly, I worked\Nin Paris for six months. That was the best time\Nof my life for sure. Except for this next phase,\Nof course. Take a seat. So, any reason you worked\Nin Paris in particular? Is that where all the\Nbeautiful women in the world have to go as a rule? Well, I speak a little French, and I've always\Nwanted to live there. So after I graduated, I went out there\Non a totally student budget. I slept in a broom closet,\Nliterally. I started this firm\Nin a supply closet, literally. <i>There you go.</i> We both know the value\Nof closet space. Yeah. Let me see some of your work. <i>Yes, of course.</i> Um... <i>I don't, uh...\NI know that I...</i> <i>I know I put them in here, so I apologize.\NI don't know what happened. Uh...</i> It's okay. Uh, you can send it to us,\Nwhenever you get a chance. Okay. So, uh, let me tell you\Nabout us. At Ruler, we approach\Narchitecture on a human level. First and... Are you okay? Um... I'm sorry. Uh, I'm just not feeling... Would you like some water, or... Cecilia? Are you feeling okay? Cecilia. Okay, so, uh, you probably shouldn't drive or operate any heavy machinery\Nfor the next few days. But other than that,\Nyou seem fine. Either myself or my admitting\Nwill follow up with you with the results\Nof the blood test. Okay? Can you just leave a number\Nwith the nurse? <i>You guys can go home.\NOkay.</i> You ready? Yeah. <i>- Hello?\N- Is Cecilia Kass there?</i> That's me. <i>Hi. Uh, this is\NDoctor Lee at St. Vincent's.</i> <i>So, we got the results\Nof your blood test back,</i> <i>and it looks like the Diazepam was\Nthe most likely cause of you fainting.</i> Um, sorry,\Nwhat Diazepam? <i>Well, your blood work showed\Na very high amount of it.</i> <i>That would definitely explain\Nwhat happened to you.</i> <i>There's something else\NI wanted to talk to you about,</i> <i>but I'm not sure if we should\Ndo it over the phone, so, um...</i> Tell him to stop. <i>Tell who to stop what?</i> Tell him to stop\Nwhat he's doing. Do you know\Nwhat she's babbling about? Nah, she hasn't explained\Nto me why we're here yet. But being her very good friend,\NI know it's a good reason. So I'm gonna need you\Nto sit up and listen. Show a little respect. One night,\NI was sitting, and I was thinking about how to leave Adrian. I was planning the\Nwhole thing in my mind. And he was staring at me. Studying me. And without me\Nsaying a single word... He said that I could\Nnever leave him. That wherever I went, he would find me. That he would\Nwalk right up to me and I wouldn't\Nbe able to see him. But that he would\Nleave me a sign so that I'd know he was there. The night I left him,\NI drugged him with that. I lost the bottle that night. And somehow, it found\Nits way back to me. So, what exactly are you saying? You lost the bottle,\Nyou found the bottle. He's not dead, Tom. I have a pile of ashes in a box that\Nwould disagree with you, Cecilia. I don't know how he's done it. He's figured it out, though. He has figured out\Na way to be invisible. He is a world leader\Nin the field of optics. I know that he could do this. Something tells me you know\Nexactly what I'm talking about. He's not dead. I just can't see him. Please tell him to stop. Okay. I agree with you, Adrian was brilliant. But it wasn't because of\Nanything he invented. It was how he got\Nin people's heads. That was his true genius,\Nknowing people's weaknesses. You think about it. He came up with the perfect way\Nto torture you, even in death. Only thing more brilliant than inventing\Nsomething that makes you invisible is not inventing it, but making you think he did. My brother controlled me long\Nbefore he met you, Cecilia. I hated him. You and I,\Nwe got that in common. I was relieved when I heard that he was dead. <i>He's gone, Cecilia.\NI saw his body.</i> Listen to me. Don't let him win\Nby bringing him back to life. Hey. Hey. Emily, I need to talk to you. Well, at least\Nnow we have clarity. Now I know\Nwhat you really think of me. What? Thanks so much\Nfor carving out the time to let me know how\N"suffocating" I am to you. What... What are you... Not that I should\Nhave to say this, but I never expected\Nany of that money. <i>Emily, I don't... I don't\Nknow what you're talking about.</i> <i>The e-mail. The e-mail\Nyou sent me this morning.</i> <i>What e-mail? If that's\Nhow you feel about me,</i> don't ask me to bail you out of your\Npersonal life anymore. If you're too stupid\Nto know who the good guys are and too weak to get away from the bad ones, don't sob to me for charity. I'm out. I didn't send you\Nthe fucking e-mail. I didn't. Someone is doing this to me. He's... He's doing this to me. Who's... Adrian? Adrian sent me\Nthe e-mail. Okay. <i>You need some medication.\NAdrian is dead.</i> Em, please, no. Cee? It's okay, Syd. <i>You... You know\Nwhat I think we need?</i> Um... I think we could kick Dad out and have a little girls' night. <i>Eat some cake.</i> Yeah, I do like cake. <i>Oh, my God.\NSydney, are you okay?</i> <i>Why would you just...\NStop! Dad!</i> <i>What? No.\NNo, Sydney, I didn't. No.</i> <i>What? What happened?\NShe... She hit me.</i> <i>What?\NNo, no, no.</i> James, I did not do that. Sydney, I would never\Nhit you. I love you. <i>I would never do that, James. It\Nwas him. He's here, I swear to you.</i> Enough. Enough!\NCee, enough. Just stop it. <i>Are you okay?\NI don't wanna stay here.</i> <i>Sydney, I'm sorry.\NI would never... Hey, hey.</i> Cee, right now, my priority is\Ngetting my baby somewhere safe. Do you understand? Come on, baby.\NIt's okay. No. James, please. This is what he wants. This is what he used to do\Nwhen we were together. He wants you to think that I\Ndid it. This is what he does. He tries to isolate me and\Nhe tries to get me alone... Hey! <i>You need to calm down.\NYou are scaring my daughter.</i> If I were you, I would\Ngo to your sister's place. You don't need to be\Nhere right now. Come on, Sydney. Sydney, I'm sorry. Sydney. Where are you? Come on! <i>Where are you?\NCome on out.</i> Don't hit a little girl. Hit me! Okay. So, why me, Adrian? You could have\Nany woman you wanted. <i>That's the sad reality.\NRight?</i> That's what money\Nand power buy you. People. So... Why me? I'm just a suburban girl who stumbled into your life\None night at a party. Can't you just forget\NI ever existed? There's nothing left\Nfor you to take. You've already taken it all. <i>This is Adrian Griffin.</i> <i>Please leave a message, and\NI'll get back to you when I can.</i> <i>Cecilia?\NYes. Go.</i> Please, hurry. <i>Lock the doors. Lock\Nthe doors! You okay?</i> <i>Yes. Please.\NPlease, just go. Please.</i> <i>Just... Please, hurry.\NPlease.</i> <i>Stinson Beach?\NThat's a long way from here.</i> <i>I... I just need\Nto get something.</i> Do you mind waiting for me? I might be two minutes, I\Nmight be 20. I don't know... But you can bring me\Nback to the city after. Sure, no problem.\NOkay. <i>Zeus.</i> Hi. Hi. 12-14-17. The day we met. So romantic. Please, meet me tonight,\Nif you can, in a public place. Eight o'clock at Yulan. And if you can't,\NI understand, but you have to tell me because\NI have to call someone else, because I don't think\NI have much time left. Thank you.\NThank you. Hi. Hey. <i>Hey, guys.\NWelcome to Yulan.</i> My name is Taylor, and I will be\Ntaking care of you this evening. Do you know\Nhow this place works? I'm assuming you order\Nfood, then you eat it. Hmm. <i>Pretty much. We just do things\Na little bit differently.</i> It's all family style. <i>We've been here before.\NIt's all good.</i> <i>Okay. Can I get you started\Nwith some water?</i> <i>We have still or sparkling.\NJust the free kind.</i> Okay, tap it is.\NCool. Thank you for being here. I love you. You're like a cop, Emily, and you have\Nthis brute-force strength that is so, so comforting\Nwhen I'm in trouble and it is really\Nintimidating when I'm not. I mean, James actually\Nis a six-foot cop, and he's, I think,\Nreally intimidated by you. <i>As he should be.\NI'd kick his ass.</i> I would. You would. I need that strength\Nin my life right now. And I need you to believe\Nwhat I'm about to tell you. Okay. What... Thank you, Taylor. All right, uh, do you guys need\Nmore time with the drink menu? Yes. Lots more time. Okay,\Nno problem at all. Emily... I went to his house today. <i>You went to Adrian's house?</i>\NYes. I just walked right in. I found something that can\Nprove what I'm experiencing. That can prove\Nthat Adrian is stalking me. What is it? It's some kind of suit\Nthat Adrian has built. And it has cameras,\Nand it somehow... What? No, please! No! You can't do this.\NYou can't do this! He killed her!\NHe killed her! <i>Please, I didn't do it!\NI didn't do it!</i> No! No! He killed her!\NHe did it! <i>- You have to listen to me!\N- Just relax.</i> Please, no! Please. No! No! Listen to me! No! You motherfucker! You killed her! I see you! I see you! He's here!\NHe's here! He's right here,\Nhe's right here! <i>Please! You can't see him.\NHe's in the room!</i> <i>You have to listen to me!\NHe's right there!</i> He's gonna hurt me. <i>Okay.\NPlease! No...</i> He's... <i>He's right there.</i>\NOkay? You'll be all right. Surprise. Cecilia... Can you confirm the person\Nin this video is you? And can you confirm you recently\Nfainted during a job interview due to a high amount of\NDiazepam in your system? I was drugged. Uh-huh. You also sent your sister\Nan email a few days ago saying you wished\Nshe was dead, didn't you? I have something. I have something\Nthat'll prove he's alive. I found it. What do you have? I can't tell you right now. He's listening. He's in the room, James. You're saying that the person who killed\Nyour sister is in the room right now, but we can't see him. Okay. Yeah. <i>James...</i> Tell me you don't think\NI did this. Tell me you know that. I may as well\Nhave done it, though. I brought Adrian into her life. I did that. I shouldn't have walked out\Non you and left you alone. I failed you. Is this bed giving you\Nany problems, Cecilia? No. Is there anything in the room\Nthat is distressing to you? No. Okay. Good. I wanted to talk to you\Nabout something. We checked the blood test that you\Nhad done at the hospital last week. Do you remember\Ntaking those blood tests? Yes. Okay. Well, did you know\Nthat you were pregnant? No. Didn't the doctor\Nwho took the test tell you? <i>No, that can't be right.\NThat's...</i> That's not true. The test shows us\Nthat it was pretty recent. We can't be sure\Nof exactly when, but it must've been some time\Nin the last month. Sweetie, is there anyone\Nwe can call? Family? Any friends? Okay. It's upsetting to\Nsee you in this condition. Even though things ended badly for you\Nand Adrian, I still look at you as family. Are you my lawyer now? I'm the lawyer\Nfor your source of income. I represent my brother's trust. The money from his trust\Nwas payable to you conditional upon you being subject\Nto criminal charges of any kind, or being ruled to be\Nmentally incompetent. Now, in light of\Nyour current situation, it's my duty to inform you that any\Nfurther payments are to be halted. I know that you set up a bank account\Nfor a friend of yours to go to college. So, I take no pleasure\Nin relaying that. I used to feel sorry for you. The blood relative\Nof a narcissist sociopath. Permanent punching bag. Handcuffed to his wallet. But now, I can see you\Nfor what you really are. You're just the jellyfish\Nversion of him. Everything but the spine. You can try to litigate it. But that's going to be\Nan expensive option. I can't see it working. However... if you sign this document and\Nforfeit your share of the trust, it'll be a lot cleaner. Or there's one option where this all goes away. Agree to have the baby and go back to him. You really think he didn't know you\Nwere secretly using birth control? 'Course he did. You should've known\Nhe'd find out. You knew him as well as I did. He replaced them\Nwith something else. You only thought you were\Ntaking birth control pills. He was always going to find you, no matter what he had to do. He needs you because\Nyou don't need him. No one's ever left him before. But he's punished you\Nenough now. Now that he knows you're\Nthe mother of his child. It's time to stop playing games. A new life with him\Ncan be given to you with one phone call. A life just like\Nyour old one with Adrian. Cecilia, you don't really\Nhave a choice right now. Right now,\Nyou're a murderer. But I can change that. Adrian killed my sister. And you helped him. I don't expect\Nyou to make a decision right now. I can come back in three days. Be good to yourself until then. We'll be watching. <i>Grab the\Numbrella, grab your rain jacket,</i> <i>grab your rain boots,\Nyou're gonna need it.</i> <i>You'll need them\Nfor a couple of days.</i> <i>This pattern we're in stays put.</i> <i>We've got this atmospheric river\Npointed right here at central California.</i> <i>And that means cloudy and rainy</i> <i>as we get through\Nthe rest of the week.</i> <i>This is a lot of moisture\Ncoming in.</i> <i>It's going to mean heavy rainfall\Nand flash-flooding concerns</i> <i>right as we get through\Nthe end of the week.</i> <i>It's not until the weekend</i> <i>that we get our next chance\Nof seeing some dry conditions.</i> <i>In fact, the next glimpse of sunshine\Ndoesn't come until Sunday afternoon,</i> <i>when temperatures\Nhit the mid-60s.</i> <i>But until then, it's gonna\Nbe cool, it's gonna be damp...</i> Open your mouth. Tongue up. Tongue down. Okay. Good night. You won't get the baby. And you won't get me. There you are. Fuck you! Get back in bed, now. Hey! No! No! Please, no! No! No! Stop! No, please! No! No, stop!\NNo, stop! He's right there! Lay down. He's right there. Lay down. <i>He's right behind you.\NListen to me.</i> Who is? He's right behind you. <i>I understand, Cecilia. Lay down.\NTurn around! He's right there!</i> <i>Listen to me!\NHe's right behind you!</i> Stay down. No, no. Bang. Hey! Okay.\NGet back! Get back! She's over here! You go left!\NAll right. You think you're\Nlearning how to beat me, so I'm gonna\Ntruly teach you something. If you fight me,\NI won't ever hurt you. I'll find someone you love\Nand hurt them instead. <i>Copy. We're following.</i> Now you've only got yourself to blame\Nfor that innocent young girl's death. No, please! Not Sydney.\NAdrian, no. <i>Hold it!\NShow me your hands!</i> Hey! Cecilia, don't do\Nanything stupid. I'm over here! Hey,\Nstop her! She's heading\Ntowards the main exit! <i>What the...\NWhat the fuck?</i> <i>Hello? Hello?</i> Hey! <i>Harry, what's going on?\NHarry?</i> What are you... Hey! <i>Hello?\NHarry, are you okay?</i> <i>He's fine.\NHe's fine, I promise.</i> <i>What?\NWho is this?</i> <i>This is James Lanier.</i> James, it's me. Cee? <i>How are you calling me?</i> <i>It doesn't matter about that.\NYou have to listen to me.</i> <i>No, it does matter.</i> Come on! <i>You can't be calling me.</i> <i>James, listen to me!\NSydney's life is in danger.</i> Where are you right now? <i>I'm at work.\NShe's at the house.</i> You need to go to her\Nright now, James. Do you hear me? 'Cause I'm afraid Adrian is\Ngonna do something to her. Sydney. Sydney. Syd, you okay? Sydney... Stop! No! Stop! Stop! Stop! Dad! No! Sydney, get down! Don't cry. Tom? Is someone there? Help! Help! Please. Help! Stand clear! <i>Police!\NShow me your hands.</i> <i>Our tactical team\Nfound Adrian this morning,</i> tied up in his basement. Looks like he was a victim of\Nhis brother just like you were. No. <i>No, James.\NThat's not right.</i> Adrian did this to me. He is not the victim here. He was tied up in his basement. If he faked his own death, he\Ncould fake his own kidnapping. We have Tom's body\Nlaying in my living room, wearing some sort of suit\Nthat you shot to pieces. If it did work,\Nit doesn't now. But we have a whole bunch of corroborative\Nwitnesses from the psychiatric hospital when it comes to seeing\Nsomething strange. Look, this is your best-case scenario\Nfor getting your freedom back, okay? No. I... I know Tom's body is in\Nyour living room. Yeah. Adrian did everything\Nbefore that though. He set his own brother up. I know how this works, Cee. <i>I know.\NYou don't understand.</i> No, you don't understand. This is what he does. He makes me feel\Nlike I'm the crazy one. <i>This is...\NThis is what he does.</i> And he's doing it again. Okay, okay.\NBut, listen. I need you to\Nkeep that to yourself and let me do my job. Okay? Just let me help you. Yeah, but as long as Adrian's\Naround, you can't help me. Cecilia? <i>I'm so glad you called.</i> Well... You look amazing. <i>I mean, you always...\NYou always look amazing.</i> I don't feel amazing. It's all a lie. Please, come on in. It's cold.\NCome on. <i>So, I... I wanted to\Nget us some simple takeout,</i> but of course I started obsessing\Nover what you'd be in the mood for. Hence, we have the OCD buffet\Nof sushi, steak, and pasta. Or you might not\Nbe hungry at all. Uh... Which is so logical that it suddenly\Nmakes this feast look moronic. I'll have steak. That's a good choice. Uh... <i>My hand's shaking.</i> You know, you're the only\Nperson in the world who gets to see my hand shake. It's 'cause I need you, Cecilia. I know I didn't treat you the\Nway you should have been treated when we were together. But I've learned my lesson. I would burn everything I own\Njust to prove that to you. Okay. Okay. If you want to be a part\Nof this child's life, it has to start with honesty. Of course. Which means I need you to\Nadmit everything that you did. That it was you, not your brother. You. Cecilia. I loved my brother. And I thought he loved me, too. I know it didn't seem like it\Nto the outside world, but Tom controlled me. Just tell me the truth. I need to know\Nthat I'm not crazy. Okay? And we can't start this\Nwith a lie. But I'm not starting with a lie. It wasn't me. I swear it. Why can't you just\Ntell me the truth? I am. Adrian, stop! I need you to do this for me. <i>More than\Nthat, do it for you, Adrian.</i> <i>I'm giving you exactly\Nwhat you're asking for, Cecilia.</i> I am telling you the truth. <i>Oh, no, no, no.</i> I know that you feel like\Nyou're going insane sometimes. But I'm the only one\Nwho can help you. Remember? Because I know you better\Nthan anyone else in the world. I mean... That shouldn't come as a... Surprise. I should go clean myself up. Of course. No! <i>No, no!\NWhat did you do?</i> <i>911,\Nwhat is your emergency?</i> Please, you have to help me,\Nplease. I'm with somebody,\Nand I think he's... He's tried to kill himself. <i>Hurry.\NYou have to help.</i> <i>You have to hurry.\NPlease.</i> It's, uh,\N3333 Celestial Drive. Please. Surprise. Hey. Hey.\NYou okay? I'm okay.\NI'm okay. <i>James, look at me.\NI'm okay.</i> He killed himself. He cut his own throat. There's security camera\Nvideo of it. You never did want to get him\Nadmitting anything on tape, did you? Of course I did. I just didn't know\Nhe was that unstable. You heard it, right? James? What'd it sound like to you? It sounded a lot like\Nhe killed himself.
