I owe everything to George Bailey. Help him, dear Father. Joseph, Jesus and Mary, help my friend Mr. Bailey. Help my son George tonight. He never thinks about himself, God. That's why he's in trouble. George is a good guy. Give him a break, God. I love him, dear Lord. Watch over him tonight. Please, God. Something's the matter with Daddy. Please bring Daddy back. Please bring Daddy home. Watch over him tonight. Please bring Daddy back. Hello, Joseph. Trouble? Looks like we'll have\Nto send someone down. A lot of people asking for help\Nfor a man named George Bailey. George Bailey? Yes. Tonight's his crucial night.\NYou're right. We'll have to send someone down\Nimmediately. Whose turn is it? That's why I came to see you, sir. It's that clockmaker's turn again. Oh, Clarence.\NHasn't got his wings yet, has he? We've passed him up right along. Because, you know, sir,\Nhe's got the IQ of a rabbit. Yes, but he's got\Nthe faith of a child. Simple. Joseph, send for Clarence. You sent for me, sir? Yes, Clarence.\NA man down on Earth needs our help. Splendid. Is he sick? No, worse. He's discouraged. At exactly 10:45 p. M. Earth time, that man will be thinking seriously of throwing away God's greatest gift. Oh, dear, dear, his life?\NThen I've only an hour to dress. What are they wearing now? You will spend that hour\Ngetting acquainted with George Bailey. Sir, if I should accomplish this mission, I mean, might I perhaps win my wings? I've been waiting\Nfor over 200 years now, sir, and people are beginning to talk. What's that book you've got there? The Adventures of Tom Sawyer. Clarence, you do a good job\Nwith George Bailey and you'll get your wings. Oh, thank you, sir. Thank you. Poor George. Sit down. Sit down? What are we... If you're going to help a man, you want to know something about him,\Ndon't you? Well, naturally, of course. I... Now, keep your eyes open. See the town? Where? I don't see a thing. Oh, I forgot.\NYou haven't got your wings yet. Now, look, I'll help you out.\NConcentrate. Begin to see something? Why, yes. This is amazing. If you ever get your wings,\Nyou'll see all by yourself. Oh, wonderful. Yay! Yippee! Okay, boys, let's go. Hey, who's that? That's your problem. George Bailey. A boy? That's him when he was 12\Nback in 1919. Something happens here\Nyou'll have to remember later on. Come on, Marty. Let's go, Marty! Attaboy, Marty. Hee-haw! Let's go, Sam. Hee-haw, Sammy! Here comes the scare-baby,\Nmy kid brother Harry Bailey. I'm not scared. Come on, Harry. Let's go, Harry! Come on, Harry! - Come on, Harry!\N- Come on, Harry! Help, George, help! Help! Don't worry, Harry. I'm coming! - Help!\N- Hang on, Harry! - Help.\N- Make a chain, gang. George saved his brother's life that day, but he caught a bad cold\Nwhich infected his left ear. Cost him his hearing in that ear. It was weeks\Nbefore he was able to go back to his after-school job\Nat old man Gower's drugstore. Mr. Potter. Who's that, a king? That's Henry F. Potter, the richest and meanest man\Nin the county. - Hee-haw! Hee-haw!\N- Hee-haw! Hee-haw! Go to work, slave. Don't worry, we'll take care of it. Wish I had a million dollars. Hot dog! It's me, Mr. Gower. George Bailey. You're late. Yes, sir. Hello, George. Hello, Mary. Hello, Violet. Two cents' worth of shoelaces? She was here first. I'm still thinking. Shoelaces? Please, Georgie. I like him. You like every boy. What's wrong with that? Here you are. Help me down? Help you down? Made up your mind yet? I'll take chocolate. - With coconuts?\N- I don't like coconuts. You don't like coconuts? Say, brainless, don't you know\Nwhere coconuts come from? Lookit here. From Tahiti, the Fiji islands,\Nthe Coral Sea. A new magazine. I never saw it before. Of course you never.\NOnly us explorers can get it. I've been nominated for membership\Nin the National Geographic Society. Is this the ear you can't hear on? George Bailey,\NI'll love you till the day I die. I'm going out exploring someday.\NYou watch. And I'm gonna have a couple of harems\Nand maybe three or four wives. Wait and see. - George. George!\N- Yes, sir? You're not paid to be a canary. No, sir. Mr. Gower, do you want something?\NAnything? No. - Anything I can do back here?\N- No. I'll get them, sir. Quick, take those capsules\Nover to Mrs. Blaine. She's waiting for them. Yes, sir. They have the diphtheria there,\Nhaven't they, sir? Yeah. Is it a charge, sir? Yes, George. Mr. Gower, I... - Oh, get going.\N- Yes, sir. Avast there, Captain Cook.\NWhere you heading? - I've got to see Pop, Uncle Billy.\N- Some other time, George. - It's important.\N- There's a squall in there. It's shaping up into a storm. - Uncle Billy, telephone.\N- Who is it? - Bank examiner.\N- Bank examiner? I should have called him yesterday. Switch it inside. I'm not crying, Mr. Potter. Well, you're begging.\NThat's a whole lot worse. All I'm asking for is 30 days more. - Pop.\N- Just a minute, Son. Just 30 short days.\NI'll dig up that $5,000 somehow. - Shove me up, shove me up.\N- Pop. - Just a minute.\N- Have you put any real pressure on these people of yours\Nto pay those mortgages? Times are bad, Mr. Potter.\NA lot of these people are out of work. Well, then, foreclose. I can't do that.\NThese families have children. - Pop.\N- They're not my children. But they're somebody's children,\NMr. Potter. Are you running a business\Nor a charity ward? - Well, all right...\N- Not with my money. Mr. Potter, what makes you\Nsuch a hard-skulled character? You have no family, no children. You can't begin\Nto spend all the money you've got. I suppose I should give it\Nto miserable failures like you and that idiot brother of yours\Nto spend for me. He's not a failure! - You can't say that about my father.\N- George, George. Quiet, George. You're not.\NYou're the biggest man in town... - Run along, run along.\N...bigger than him, - bigger than everybody.\N- Gives you an idea of the Baileys. Don't let him say that about you, Pop. All right, Son. All right. Thanks. I'll talk to you tonight. What? Why, that medicine should have\Nbeen there an hour ago. It will be over in five minutes,\NMrs. Blaine. Where's Mrs. Blaine's box of capsules? I... You... Didn't you hear what I said? Yes, sir. I... What kind of tricks\Nare you playing anyway? Why didn't you deliver them right away? Don't you know that boy's very sick? You're hurting my sore ear. You lazy loafer. Mr. Gower,\Nyou don't know what you're doing. You put something wrong\Nin those capsules. I know you're unhappy. You got the telegram, and you're upset. You put something bad\Nin those capsules. It wasn't your fault, Mr. Gower. Just look and see what you did. The bottle you took the powder from,\Nit's poison. I tell you, it's poison. I know you feel bad. - Oh!\N- Don't hurt my sore ear again! - Don't hurt my sore ear again.\N- Oh, no, no. Oh, George, George. Oh, Mr. Gower, I won't ever tell anyone. I know how you're feeling. I won't ever tell a soul.\NHope to die, I won't. Oh, George. George. An overnight bag.\NGenuine English cowhide. Combination lock. - Fitted up with brushes, combs...\N- Nope, nope, nope, nope. Now, look, Joe. Now, look. I want a big one. What did you stop it for? I want you to take a good look\Nat that face. Who is it? George Bailey. Oh, you mean the kid that had his ears\Nslapped back by the druggist? That's the kid. It's a good face. I like it. I like George Bailey. Tell me,\Ndid he ever tell anyone about the pills? Not a soul. Did he ever marry the girl?\NDid he ever go exploring? Well, wait and see. Big, see? I don't want one for one night. I want something for 1,001 nights with plenty of room here for labels\Nfrom Italy and Baghdad, Samarkand. Great big thing, about... - I see. A flying carpet, huh?\N- Yeah. I don't suppose you'd like\Nthis old secondhand job, would you? Now you're talking. Gee whiz, I could use that as a raft\Nin case the boat sunk. - How much this cost?\N- No charge. That's my trick ear, Joe.\NIt sounded like you said "no charge." That's right. Well, what's my name doing on it? A little present from old man Gower.\NCame down and picked it out himself. He did? What do you know about that?\NMy old boss. Isn't that nice? What boat are you sailing on? I'm working across on a cattle boat. - A cattle boat?\N- Okay, I like cows. Hello, Mr. Gower. How are you? Thanks ever so much for the baggage.\NIt's just exactly what I wanted. Forget it. - It's wonderful of you to think of me.\N- Hope you enjoy it. I wish I had a million dollars. Hot dog! Avast there, Captain Cook! - You got your sea legs yet?\N- Parlez-vous francais, mister? Hey, send us some of those\Npicture postcards, will you, George? Hey, George,\Ndon't take any plug nickels. Hey, George, your suitcase is leaking. Hey, Ernie! - Hi, Ernie. Hi, Bert.\N- Hiya, George. - George.\N- Hey, I'm a rich tourist today. How about driving me home in style? - Hop in, Your Highness. Hop in.\N- Yes, sir. And for the carriage trade,\NI put on my hat. Good afternoon, Mr. Bailey. Hello, Violet. Hey, you look good.\NThat's some dress you got on there. This old thing? Why, I only wear it\Nwhen I don't care how I look. - How would you like to take...\N- Yes. Want to come along, Bert?\NWe'll show you the town. No, thanks. I think I'll go home\Nand see what the wife's doing. Family man. George, Harry,\Nyou're shaking the house down. Stop it. Let them alone.\NI wish I was up there with them. But Harry will tear his dinner suit.\NGeorge! That's why all children should be girls. Well, if they were all girls\Nthere wouldn't be any... Oh, never mind. George, Harry,\Ncome down to dinner this minute. Everything's getting cold, and you know\Nhow long we've been waiting for you. - Okay, Ma.\N- Okay, Ma. - Ta-da!\N- Ta-da! - We got a present for you, Pop.\N- There you are. Oh, you two idiots. George, sit down and have dinner. - Fine.\N- I've eaten. Well, aren't you gonna finish dressing\Nfor your graduating party? Look at you! I don't care. It's George's tux. Annie, my sweet,\Nhave you got those pies? If you lay a hand on me,\NI'll hit you with this broom! Annie, I'm in love with you.\NThere's a moon out tonight. Boy, oh boy, oh boy! My last meal\Nin the old Bailey boarding house. Oh, my lands, my blood pressure. Pop, can I have the car? I gotta\Ntake over a lot of plates and things. What plates? Mom, I'm chairman\Nof the Eats Committee. We only need a couple of dozen. Oh, no, you don't, Harry.\NNow, not my best Haviland, no. Oh, let him have the plates, Mother. Hope you have a good trip, George.\NUncle Billy and I are gonna miss you. I'm gonna miss you, too, Pop. What's the matter? You look tired. I had another tussle with Potter today. I thought when we put him\Non the board of directors, he'd ease up on us a little bit. What's eating that old\Nmoney-grubbing buzzard anyway? He's a sick man, frustrated,\Nsick in his mind. Sick in his soul, if he has one. He hates everybody\Nthat has anything that he can't have. He hates us mostly, I guess. Gangway. Gangway. - So long, Pop.\N- So long. - You got a match?\N- Very funny, very funny. Put those things in the car, and I'll get your tie and studs ready\Nfor you. Now, hurry up. - Okay, Mom.\N- Now, don't drop one of those. You coming later, George? What do you mean,\Nand be bored to death? Couldn't want a better death.\NLots of pretty girls, and we're gonna use\Nthat new floor tonight, too. - I hope it works.\N- No gin tonight, Son. Oh, Pop, just a little? No, Son. Not one drop. Boys and girls and music. Why do they need gin? Did I act like that\Nwhen I graduated from high school? Pretty much. You know, George, I wish\Nwe could send Harry to college with you. Your mother and I talked it over\Nhalf the night. We have that all figured out. You see, Harry will take my job\Nat the Building and Loan, work there for four years, then he'll go. Pretty young for that job. Well, no younger than I was. Well, you were born older, George. How's that? I said you were born older. I suppose you've decided\Nwhat you want to do when you get out of college. Well, you know\Nwhat I've always talked about, build things, design new buildings,\Nplan modern cities. All that stuff I've been talking about. Still after that first million\Nbefore you're 30? I'll settle for half that in cash. Of course, it's just a hope. But you wouldn't consider coming back to the Building and Loan, would you? Well, I... I... Annie, why don't you draw up a chair?\NThen you'd be more comfortable, and you could hear everything\Nthat's going on. I would if I thought\NI'd hear anything worth listening to. You would, eh? I know it's soon to talk about it. No, now, Pop, I couldn't. I couldn't face being cooped up\Nfor the rest of my life in a shabby little office. I'm sorry, Pop. I didn't mean that, but I... It's this business of nickels and dimes and spending all your life\Ntrying to figure out how to save three cents\Non a length of pipe. I'd go crazy. I want to do something big\Nand something important. You know, George,\NI feel that, in a small way, we're doing something important, satisfying a fundamental urge. It's deep in the race for a man to want\Nhis own roof and walls and fireplace. And we're helping him get those things in our shabby little office. I know, Pop. I know that. I wish I felt that... I've been hoarding pennies\Nlike a miser here in order to... Most of my friends\Nhave already finished college. I just feel like if I didn't get away,\NI'd bust. Yes, yes, you're right, Son. You see what I mean, don't you, Pop? This town is no place for any man unless he's willing to crawl to Potter. Now, you've got talent, Son. I've seen it. You get yourself an education\Nand get out of here. Pop, you want a shock? I think you're a great guy. - Why, did you hear that, Annie?\N- I heard it. It's about time\None of you lunkheads said it. I'm gonna miss old Annie. Pop, I think I'll get dressed\Nand go over to Harry's party. Have a good time, Son. Excuse me. There you are. George, hello. You know my kid brother George. - I'm gonna put him through college.\N- Hello, George. Hee-haw! Sam Wainwright. How are you? When did you get here? This afternoon.\NI thought I'd give the kids a treat. Old college graduate now. Yeah, old "Joe College" Wainwright\Nthey call me. Well, freshman, looks like\Nyou're gonna make it after all, huh? - Harry, you're the guy I want to see.\N- Hello, Sam. - Coach has heard all about you.\N- He has? Yeah, he's followed every game,\Nand his mouth's watering. He wants me to find out\Nif you're gonna come along with us. Well, I got to make some dough first. Well, you better make it fast.\NWe need great ends like you. Not broken down old guys like this one. Hee-haw! George, welcome back. Hello, Mr. Partridge, how are you? Putting a pool under this floor was\Na great idea. Saved us another building. Now, Harry, Sam, have a lot of fun. There's lots of stuff here to eat\Nand drink. Lots of pretty girls around. A third dance... A third... - Hello, Violet.\N- Hello. What am I bid? George. Marty! Well, it's old home week. - Marty!\N- Sam, Harry, how are you? - Do me a favor, will you, George?\N- What's that? - You remember my kid sister Mary.\N- Oh, yeah. Yeah. "Mama wants you, Marty.\NMama wants you." Remember? Dance with her, will you? Oh, me? Well, I feel funny enough\Nalready with all these kids. Come on, be a sport. Just dance with her one time, and you'll\Ngive her the thrill of her life. Hey, Sis! Don't be long, Marty. I'm not being a wet nurse to a... The next thing I knew,\Nsome guy came up and tripped me. That's the reason why I came in fourth. If it hadn't been for that,\Nthat race'd have been a cinch. I tried to find out who it was later,\Nbut I couldn't find out. Nobody'd ever tell you whoever it was,\Nbecause they'd be scared. 'Cause they know\Nwhat kind of a guy I am. You remember George. This is Mary. Well, I'll be seeing you. Well, well, well. Now to get back to my story, see? Hey, this is my dance. Why don't you stop annoying people? Well, I'm sorry. Hey! - Well, hello.\N- Hello. You look at me as if you didn't know me. Well, I don't. You've passed me on the street\Nalmost every day. Me? No. That was a little girl\Nnamed Mary Hatch. That wasn't you. Oh, yes! Oh, yes! Oh, yes!\NThe big Charleston contest! The prize, a genuine loving cup. Those not tapped by the judges\Nwill remain on the floor. Let's go! I'm not very good at this. Neither am I. Okay. What can we lose? Hey, you're wonderful. What's the matter, Othello? Jealous? Did you know there's a swimming pool\Nunder this floor? And did you know that button behind you\Ncauses this floor to open up? And did you further know\Nthat George Bailey is dancing right over that crack? And I've got the key. Stand back, everybody! Stand back! They're cheering us. We must be good. Get out of there! What... Oh, well. Buffalo gals\Ncan't you come out tonight? Can't you come out tonight? Buffalo gals, can't you come out tonight And dance By the light Of the moon? - Oh, hot dog. Just like an organ.\N- Beautiful. I told Harry I thought\NI'd be bored to death. You should have seen\Nthe commotion in that locker room. I had to knock down three people\Nto get this stuff we're wearing here. Let me hold that old wet dress of yours. Do I look as funny as you do? I guess I'm not quite the football type. You look wonderful! You know, if it wasn't me talking, I'd say you were\Nthe prettiest girl in town. Well, why don't you say it? I don't know. Maybe I will say it.\NHow old are you anyway? Eighteen. Eighteen? Why, it was only last year\Nyou were seventeen. Too young or too old? Oh, no, no. Just right. Your age fits you. Yes, sir, you look a little older\Nwithout your clothes on. I mean, without a dress you look older. I mean younger. You look... You just... I'm on the thing here. Sir, my train, please. A pox upon me for a clumsy lout. Your caboose, milady. You may kiss my hand. Hey. Hey, Mary. As I was lumberin' down the street Down the street, down the street Okay, then. I'll throw a rock\Nat the old Granville house. Oh, no, don't. I love that old house. No, you see, you make a wish\Nand then try and break some glass. And you got to be\Na pretty good shot nowadays, too. Oh, no, George, don't.\NIt's full of romance, that old place. I'd like to live in it. In that place? I wouldn't live in it as a ghost.\NNow, watch. Right in the second floor, there. See? What did you wish, George? Not just one wish, a whole hatful. Mary, I know what\NI'm gonna do tomorrow and the next day and next year\Nand the year after that. I'm shaking the dust\Nof this crummy little town off my feet, and I'm gonna see the world! Italy, Greece, the Parthenon,\Nthe Coliseum. Then I'm coming back here and go\Nto college to see what they know. And then I'm gonna build things. I'm gonna build airfields. I'm gonna build skyscrapers\N100 stories high. I'm gonna build bridges a mile long. What, are you gonna throw a rock? Hey, that's pretty good. What did you wish, Mary? Buffalo gals\Ncan't you come out tonight? Can't you come out tonight? Buffalo gals, can't you come out tonight And Dance by the light of the moon? What did you wish\Nwhen you threw that rock? - Oh, no.\N- Come on, tell me. If I told you, it might not come true. What is it you want, Mary? What do you want? You want the moon? Just say the word, and I'll throw a lasso\Naround it and pull it down. Hey, that's a pretty good idea.\NI'll give you the moon, Mary. I'll take it. Then what? Well, then you could swallow it,\Nand it would all dissolve, see? And the moonbeams would shoot out\Nof your fingers and your toes and the ends of your hair. - Am I talking too much?\N- Yes! Why don't you kiss her\Ninstead of talking her to death? How's that? Why don't you kiss her\Ninstead of talking her to death? You want me to kiss her, huh? Youth is wasted on the wrong people. Hey. Hey, hold on, hey, mister.\NCome on back out here! I'll show you some kissing that'll put\Nhair back on your head. What are you... Mary? Okay, I give up. Where are you? Over here in the hydrangea bushes. Here you are. Catch. Wait a minute. What am I doing? This is a very interesting situation. Please give me my robe. A man doesn't get in a situation\Nlike this every day. I'd like to have my robe. Not in Bedford Falls, anyway. - Ouch! Oh!\N- Gesundheit. - George Bailey!\N- This requires a little thought here. Give me my robe. I've read about things like this,\Nbut I've never... Shame on you!\NI'm gonna tell your mother on you. My mother's way up on the corner there. I'll call the police. They're way downtown.\NThey'd be on my side, too. Then I'm going to scream! Maybe I could sell tickets. Let's see. No, the point is in order to get this robe... I've got it. I'll make a deal with you, Mary. George! George! George, come on home! Quick! - Your father's had a stroke.\N- What? - Mary, Mary, I'm sorry. I've got to go.\N- Come on, George, let's hurry. - Did you get a doctor?\N- Yes. Campbell's there now. I think that's all\Nwe'll need you for, George. - I know you're anxious to make a train.\N- I have a taxi waiting downstairs. I want the board to know\Nthat George gave up his trip to Europe to help straighten things out here\Nthese past few months. Good luck to you at school, George. - Good luck, George.\N- Goodbye, George. And now we come to the real purpose\Nof this meeting, to appoint a successor\Nto our dear friend Peter Bailey. Mr. Chairman,\NI'd like to get to my real purpose. - Wait just a minute now.\N- Wait for what? I claim this institution\Nis not necessary to this town. Therefore, Mr. Chairman, I make\Na motion to dissolve this institution and turn its assets and liabilities\Nover to the receiver. Potter, you dirty, contemptible...\NI'll wring his neck. George, did you hear\Nwhat that buzzard... Mr. Chairman. It's too soon after Peter Bailey's death to talk about chloroforming\Nthe Building and Loan. Peter Bailey died three months ago. I second Mr. Potter's motion. Very well. In that case, I'll ask the two executive officers\Nto withdraw. But before you go, I'm sure the whole board wishes\Nto express its deep sorrow - at the passing of Peter Bailey.\N- Thank you very much. It was his faith and devotion that are responsible\Nfor this organization. I'll go further than that. I'll say that to the public\NPeter Bailey was the Building and Loan. That's fine, Potter, coming from you, considering that you probably\Ndrove him to his grave. Peter Bailey was not a businessman. That's what killed him. Oh, I don't mean any disrespect to him.\NGod rest his soul. He was a man of high ideals, so-called. But ideals without common sense\Ncan ruin this town. Now, you take this loan here\Nto Ernie Bishop, you know,\Nthat fellow that sits around all day on his brains in his taxi, you know. I happen to know\Nthe bank turned down this loan. But he comes here, and we're building him\Na house worth $5,000. - Why?\N- Well, I handled that, Mr. Potter. You have all the papers there.\NHis salary, insurance. I can personally vouch for his character. - A friend of yours?\N- Yes, sir. You see, if you shoot pool\Nwith some employee here, you can come and borrow money. What does that get us? A discontented, lazy rabble instead of a thrifty working class. And all because\Na few starry-eyed dreamers like Peter Bailey stir them up\Nand fill their heads with a lot of impossible ideas. Now, I say... Just a minute. Just a minute.\NNow, hold on, Mr. Potter. You're right when you say my father\Nwas no businessman. I know that. Why he ever started this cheap\Npenny-ante Building and Loan I'll never know. But neither you nor anybody else\Ncan say anything against his character, because his whole life was... Why, in the 25 years since he\Nand Uncle Billy started this thing, he never once thought of himself.\NIsn't that right, Uncle Billy? He didn't save enough money\Nto send Harry to school, let alone me. But he did help a few people\Nget out of your slums, Mr. Potter. And what's wrong with that?\NWhy, here, you're all businessmen here. Don't it make them better citizens, and\Ndoesn't it make them better customers? You said that they...\NWhat'd you say just a minute ago? They had to wait and save their money before they even thought\Nof a decent home. Wait? Wait for what? Until their children grow up\Nand leave them? Until they're so old\Nand broken-down that they... Do you know how long it takes\Na working man to save $5,000? Just remember this, Mr. Potter,\Nthat this rabble you're talking about, they do most of the working and paying\Nand living and dying in this community. Well, is it too much to have them work\Nand pay and live and die in a couple of decent rooms and a bath? Anyway, my father didn't think so. People were human beings to him,\Nbut to you, a warped, frustrated old man,\Nthey're cattle. Well, in my book, he died\Na much richer man than you'll ever be. I'm not interested in your book. I'm talking about the Building and Loan. I know very well\Nwhat you're talking about. You're talking about something\Nyou can't get your fingers on, and it's galling you.\NThat's what you're talking about, I know. Well, I've said too much. I... You're the Board here.\NYou do what you want with this thing. There's just one thing more, though. This town needs\Nthis measly one-horse institution if only to have someplace where people\Ncan come without crawling to Potter. Come on, Uncle Billy. Sentimental hogwash. I want my motion. Boy, oh boy, that was telling him,\NGeorge, old boy. You shut his big mouth.\NYou should have heard him. What happened?\NWe heard a lot of yelling. Well, we're being voted\Nout of business after 25 years. - Easy come, easy go.\N- Here it is. "Help wanted. Female." You still want me\Nto hang around, George? - Yeah, I'll be right down.\N- Yeah, hey, you'll miss your train. You're a week late for school already.\NGo on. - What's going on in there?\N- Never mind. Don't worry about that. They're putting us out of business.\NSo what? I can get another job. - I'm only 55.\N- 56. Go on, go on.\NHey, look, you gave up your boat trip, now you don't want to miss college,\Ntoo, do you? George! George!\NThey voted Potter down. They want to keep it going. You did it, George. You did it. They got one condition,\Nonly one condition. - What's that?\N- And that's the best part of it. They've appointed George here\Nas Executive Secretary to take his father's place. - Oh, no! But, Uncle Billy...\N- You can keep him on. That's all right. As Secretary,\Nyou can hire anyone you like. Dr. Campbell, now let's get\Nthis thing straight. I'm leaving. I'm leaving right now.\NI'm going to school. This is my last chance.\NUncle Billy here, he's your man. But, George,\Nthey'll vote with Potter otherwise. - I know, I know, he didn't go.\N- That's right. Not only that, but he gave\Nhis school money to his brother, Harry, and sent him to college. Harry became a football star. Made second team all-American. Yeah, but what happened to George? George got four years older,\Nwaiting for Harry to come back and take over the Building and Loans. There are plenty of jobs around\Nfor somebody that likes to travel. Look at this. Here. Venezuela oil fields. "Wanted,\Nman with construction experience." Here's the Yukon, right here. "Wanted,\Nman with engineering experience." There she blows. You know what the three most exciting\Nsounds in the world are? Breakfast is served.\NLunch is served. Dinner... No, no, no, no! Anchor chains,\Nplane motors and train whistles. - Peanut?\N- There's the professor now. Old Professor Phi Beta Kappa\Nall-American Bailey. Why, old George\N"Geographic Explorer" Bailey. What? No husky dogs? No sled?\NUncle Billy, you haven't changed a bit. Nobody ever changes here,\Nyou know that. Oh, am I glad to see you. - Say, where's Mother?\N- She's home, cooking the fatted calf. - Come on, let's go.\N- Oh, wait! Wait, wait a minute. George, Uncle Billy,\NI want you to meet Ruth. - Hello.\N- How do you do? - Ruth Dakin.\N- Ruth Dakin Bailey, if you don't mind. - Huh?\N- Well, I wired you I had a surprise. Here she is. Meet the wife. Well, what do you know? A wife. - Well, how do you do? Congratulations.\N- How do you do? What am I doing? Congratulations! - Doggone it, Harry, you...\N- They're married! Why don't you tell somebody? Come on, Mrs. Bailey,\NI can't wait to see everybody's reaction. - You're really married?\N- Why, yes. What's a pretty girl like you doing marrying this two-headed brother\Nof mine? Well, I'll tell you. It's purely mercenary.\NMy father offered him a job. Oh, he got you and the job?\NWell, Harry's cup runneth over. George, about that job. Ruth spoke\Nout of turn. I never said I'd take it. You've been holding the bag here\Nfor four years, and, well, I won't let you down, George.\NI would like to... Oh, wait a minute. I forgot the bags.\NI'll be right back. It was a surprise to me. This is the new Mrs. Bailey,\Nmy nephew's wife. - How are you?\N- Old, old friend of the Baileys. Oh, really? What are their names?\NLet's see... Oh, of course,\NI've heard him speak of you. And I want to tell you,\Nwe're gonna give the biggest party this town ever saw. Here, have some popcorn. George, George, George.\NThat's all Harry ever talks about. Ruth, this... What about this job? Well, my father owns a glass factory\Nin Buffalo. He wants to get Harry started\Nin the research business. - Well, is it a good job?\N- Oh, yes, very. Not much money,\Nbut good future, you know. - Yeah.\N- Harry's a genius at research. - My father just fell in love with him.\N- And you did, too. Hey, Joe. Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy, oh boy.\NI feel so good. I could spit in Potter's eye.\NI think I will. I think I will. What did you say? Huh? Maybe I'd better go home. Where's my hat? Where's my... - Oh, thank you, George. Which is mine?\N- The middle one. Oh, thank you, George.\NOh boy, oh boy. Now, look, if you'll point me in the right direction...\NWould you do that, George? Right down here. Old Building and Loan pal, huh? Now you just turn this way\Nand then right straight down there. Oh, that way, huh? My wild Irish rose I'm all right. I'm all right. The sweetest flower I know Hello, Ma. That's for nothing. - How do you like her?\N- She's swell, isn't she? Looks like\Nshe can keep Harry on his toes. Keep him out of Bedford Falls, anyway. Did you know that Mary Hatch\Nis back from school? Came back three days ago. Nice girl, Mary. Kind that'll help you\Nfind the answers, George. Stop that grunting. Can you give me one good reason\Nwhy you shouldn't call on Mary? Sure. Sam Wainwright. - Hee-haw?\N- Yes, Sam's crazy about Mary. - Well, she's not crazy about him.\N- Well, how do you know? - What, did she discuss it with you?\N- No. - Well, then how do you know?\N- Well, I've got eyes, haven't I? Why, she lights up like a firefly\Nwhenever you're around. Besides,\NSam Wainwright's away in New York, - and you're here in Bedford Falls.\N- And all's fair in love and war. I don't know about war. Mother of mine, I can see right through\Nyou right to your back-collar button. Trying to get rid of me, huh? Well, here's your hat.\NWhat's your hurry? All right, Mother,\Nold Building and Loan pal, I think I'll go out and find a girl\Nand do a little passionate necking. Oh, George. Now, if you'll just point me\Nin the right direction... This direction. Good night, Mrs. Bailey. - Excuse me.\N- Now, wait a minute. I think I got a date. But stick around, fellows,\Njust in case, huh? We'll wait for you, baby. - Hello, Georgie Porgie!\N- Hello Vi. - What gives?\N- Nothing. Where are you going? Oh, I'll probably end up\Ndown at the library. Georgie, don't you ever get tired\Nof just reading about things? Yes. - What are you doing tonight?\N- Not a thing. Are you game, Vi?\NLet's make a night of it. I'd love it, Georgie. What'll we do? Let's go out in the fields\Nand take off our shoes - and walk through the grass.\N- Huh? Then we can go up to the falls.\NIt's beautiful up there in the moonlight, and there's a green pool up there,\Nand we can swim in it. Then we can climb Mount Bedford\Nand smell the pines and watch the sunrise\Nagainst the peaks, and we'll stay up there the whole night, and everybody'll be talking.\NThere'll be a terrific scandal. Georgie, have you gone crazy?\NWhy, walk in the grass in my bare feet? Why it's 10 miles up to Mount Bedford. - If you think...\N- Okay, just forget about the whole thing. - What are you doing, picketing?\N- Hello, Mary. I just happened to be passing by here. Yes, so I noticed. - Have you made up your mind?\N- How's that? - Have you made up your mind?\N- About what? About coming in. Your mother just phoned\Nand said you were on your way over - to pay me a visit.\N- My mother just called you? Well, how did she know? - Didn't you tell her?\N- I didn't tell anybody. I just went for a walk\Nand happened to be passing by here. What do you... Went for a walk. That's all. - I'll be downstairs, Mother.\N- All right, dear. Well, are you coming in or aren't you? Well, I'll come in for a minute. But I... I didn't tell anybody\NI was coming over here, you know. - When did you get back?\N- Tuesday. Where did you get that dress? - Do you like it?\N- It's all right. I thought you would go back\Nto New York, like Sam and Angie\Nand the rest of them. I worked there a couple of vacations,\Nbut I don't know. I guess I was homesick. Homesick? For Bedford Falls? Yes, and my family and... Everything. Would you like to sit down? All right, for a minute. I still can't understand it, though. You know, I didn't tell anybody\NI was coming here. Would you rather leave? No. I don't want to be rude. Well, then, sit down. What's that? Some joke, huh? Well... I see it still smells like pine needles\Naround here. Thank you. And dance by the What's the matter? Oh. Oh, yeah, yeah. Well... Nice about your brother Harry\Nand Ruth, isn't it? Oh, yeah, yeah, that's all right. Don't you like her? Well, of course I like her.\NShe's a peach. Oh, just marriage in general\Nyou're not enthusiastic about, huh? No. Marriage is all right\Nfor Harry and Marty and Sam and you. Mary! Mary! Who's down there with you? It's George Bailey, Mother. George Bailey? What's he want? I don't know. What do you want? Me? Not a thing. I just came in to get warm. He's making violent love to me, Mother. You tell him to go right back home,\Nand don't you leave the house, either! Sam Wainwright promised to call you\Nfrom New York tonight. What's your mother mean?\NYou know, I didn't come here to... - What did you come here for, then?\N- I don't know. You tell me. You're supposed to be the one\Nthat has all the answers. You tell me. - Why don't you go home?\N- That's where I'm going. I don't know why I came here\Nin the first place. - Good night.\N- Good night! Mary! Mary! The telephone. It's Sam. I'll get it. Whatever were you doing\Nthat you couldn't hear? Mary, he's waiting. Hello? Forgot my hat. Hee-haw! Hello, Sam, how are you? I'm great.\NGee, it's good to hear your voice again. Well, that's awfully sweet of you, Sam. There's an old friend of yours here.\NGeorge Bailey. You mean old mossback George? Yes, old mossback George. Hee-haw! Put him on. Wait just a minute. I'll call him. George! He doesn't want to speak to George,\Nyou idiot. He does so. He asked for him. George, Sam wants to speak to you. Hi, Sam. Well, George Baileyoffski!\NHey, a fine pal you are. What're you trying to do, steal my girl? What do you mean? Nobody's trying to steal anybody's girl. Here... Here's Mary. No, wait a minute. Wait a minute.\NI want to talk to both of you. Tell Mary to get on the extension. - Mother's on the extension. We...\N- I am not! We can both hear. Come here. We're listening, Sam. Well, look, I have a big deal coming up\Nthat's gonna make us all rich. George, do you remember\Nthat night in Martini's bar when you told me you'd read someplace\Nabout making plastics out of soybeans? - Chili beans.\N- Shut up, will you? You remember, out of chili...\NOut of soybeans. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Soybeans, yeah. Well, listen, Dad snapped up the idea, and he's gonna build\Na factory outside of Rochester. How do you like that? Rochester? Well, why Rochester? Well, why not?\NCan you think of anything better? Well, I don't know.\NJust why not right here? You remember that old tool\Nand machinery works? You tell your father\Nhe can get that for a song. And all the labor he wants, too. Half the town was thrown out of work\Nwhen they closed down. That so? Well, I'll tell him. Hey, that sounds great. Oh, baby, I knew you'd come through. Now here's the point, Mary.\NMary, you're in on this, too. Now listen. Have you got any money? Money? Yeah... Well, a little. Well, now, listen. I want you to put every cent you've got\Ninto our stock, do you hear? And, George, I may have a job for you, that is unless you're still married\Nto that broken-down Building and Loan. Well, this is the biggest thing\Nsince radio, and I'm letting you in\Non the ground floor. Oh, Mary. Mary? I'm here. Would you tell that guy I'm giving him the chance\Nof a lifetime, do you hear? The chance of a lifetime! He says it's the chance of a lifetime. Now you listen to me. I don't want any plastics,\Nand I don't want any ground floors. And I don't want to get married,\Never, to anyone. You understand that? I want to do what I want to do. And you're... And you're... - Oh, Mary, Mary.\N- George, George, George. Oh, Mary. Oh, dear. Oh, dear. Oh, dear. Mary... Here they come! Here they come! Goodbye, George! Goodbye! First Harry, now George. Annie, we're just two old maids now. You speak for yourself, Miss B. If either of you two\Nsee a stranger around here, it's me. Hey, look.\NThere's somebody driving this cab. Bert the cop sent this over. He said to float away\Nto Happyland on the bubbles. Oh, look at this. Old Bert. Champagne! By the way, where are you two going\Non this here now honeymoon? Where are we going? Look at this. There's the kitty, Ernie.\NHere, come on, count it, Mary. I feel like a bootlegger's wife. Look. You know what we're gonna do?\NWe're gonna shoot the works. A whole week in New York.\NA whole week in Bermuda. The highest hotels,\Nthe oldest champagne, the richest caviar, the hottest music\Nand the prettiest wife. That does it! Then what? - Then what, honey?\N- After that, who cares? That does it, come here. Come here. Don't look now,\Nbut there's something funny going on over there\Nat the bank, George. I've never really seen one, but that's got\Nall the earmarks of being a run. Hey, Ernie, if you got any money\Nin the bank, you better hurry. George, let's not stop. Let's go! Just a minute, dear. - Please, let's not stop, George.\N- I'll be back in a minute, Mary. Well, hello, everybody.\NMrs. Thompson, how are you? Charlie? What's the matter here,\Ncan't you get in? What is this, Uncle Billy? A holiday? George. Come on in, everybody.\NThat's right. Just come on in. Look out, you. Now, look, why don't you all sit down? There are a lot of seats over there. Just make yourselves at home. George, can I see you a minute? - Why didn't you call me?\N- I just did, but they said you left. This is a pickle, George.\NThis is a pickle. All right, now, what happened?\NHow did it start? How does a thing like this ever start? - All I know is the bank called our loan.\N- When? About an hour ago.\NI handed over all our cash. - All of it?\N- Every cent of it, - and still it was less than we owe them.\N- Holy mackerel! And then I got scared, George,\Nand closed the doors. I... I... The whole town's gone crazy. Yeah, hello? George, it's Potter. Hello? George, there is a rumor around town\Nthat you've closed your doors. Is that true? Oh, well, I'm very glad to hear that. George, are you all right?\NDo you need any police? Police? What for? Well, mobs get pretty ugly\Nsometimes, you know. George, I'm going all out\Nto help in this crisis. I've just guaranteed the bank\Nsufficient funds to meet their needs. They'll close up for a week\Nand then reopen. He just took over the bank. I may lose a fortune, but I'm willing\Nto guarantee your people, too. Just tell them\Nto bring their shares over here, and I will pay 50 cents on the dollar. You never miss a trick, do you, Potter? Well, you're gonna miss this one. If you close your doors before 6:00 p. M.,\Nyou will never reopen. George, was it a nice wedding? Gosh, I wanted to be there. Yeah. You can take this one off now. Now, just remember that this thing\Nisn't as black as it appeared. I have some news for you, folks. I was just talking to old man Potter, and he's guaranteed cash payments\Nat the bank. The bank's gonna reopen next week. But, George, I got my money here. Did he guarantee this place? Well, no, Charlie. I didn't even ask him.\NWe don't need Potter over here. Then, I'll take mine now. No, but you're... You're thinking of this place all wrong, as if I had the money back in a safe.\NThe money's not here. Well, your money's in Joe's house.\NThat's right next to yours. And in the Kennedy house\Nand Mrs. Macklin's house and 100 others. Why, you're lending them\Nthe money to build, and then, they're gonna pay it back\Nto you as best they can. Now, what are you gonna do,\Nforeclose on them? I got $242 in here,\Nand $242 isn't going to break anybody. Okay, Tom. All right. Here you are. You sign this.\NYou'll get your money in 60 days. Sixty days? Now, that's what you agreed to\Nwhen you bought your shares. - Tom! Tom, did you get your money?\N- No. Well, I did. Old man Potter'll pay 50 cents\Non the dollar for every share you've got. - Fifty cents on the dollar!\N- Yes, cash! Well, what do you say? Now, Tom, you have to stick\Nto your original agreement. Now, give us 60 days on this. - Okay, Randall.\N- Are you going to go to Potter's? Better to get half than nothing. Tom! Tom! Randall! Now, Randall, wait! Wait. Now, listen. Now, listen to me.\NI beg of you not to do this thing. If Potter gets a hold\Nof this Building and Loan, there'll never be\Nanother decent house built in this town. He's already got charge of the bank. He's got the bus line.\NHe got the department stores. And now he's after us. Why?\NWell, it's very simple. Because we're cutting in\Non his business, that's why. And because he wants\Nto keep you living in his slums and paying the kind of rent he decides. Joe, you had one\Nof those Potter houses, didn't you? Well, have you forgotten? Have you forgotten what he charged you\Nfor that broken-down shack? Here, Ed, you know. You remember last\Nyear when things weren't going so well and you couldn't make your payments. Well, you didn't lose your house,\Ndid you? You think Potter would've\Nlet you keep it? Can't you understand\Nwhat's happening here? Don't you see what's happening? Potter isn't selling.\NPotter's buying, and why? Because we're panicky and he's not.\NThat's why. He's picking up some bargain. Now we can get through\Nthis thing all right. We've got to stick together, though. We've got to have faith in each other. But my husband hasn't worked\Nin over a year, and I need money. How am going to live\Nuntil the bank opens? - I got doctor bills to pay.\N- I need cash. I can't feed my kids on faith. How much do you need? Hey! I got $2,000. Here's $2,000.\NThis'll tide us over till the bank reopens. - All right, Tom, how much do you need?\N- $242. Tom, just enough to tide you over\Nuntil the bank reopens. I'll take $242. - There you are.\N- That'll close my account. Your account's still here. That's a loan. - Okay. All right, Ed?\N- I got $300 here, George. Now, Ed, what'll it take\Ntill the bank opens? What do you need? Well, I suppose $20. $20. Now you're talking.\NThanks, Ed. That's fine. All right, now, Mrs. Thompson,\Nhow much do you want? But it's your own money, George. Never mind about that.\NHow much do you want? - I can get along with $20, all right.\N- $20, fine. - And I'll sign the paper.\N- You don't have to sign anything. I know you. You pay it when you can.\NThat's okay. - All right, Mrs. Davis?\N- Could I have $17.50? Bless your heart. Of course\Nyou can have it. You got 50 cents? - Seven...\N- We're gonna make it, George. ...six...\N- They'll never close us up today! ...five, four, three, two, one, bingo! We made it! Close the door, Eustace!\NWe made it. Look, look, we're still in business.\NWe've still got 2 bucks left. Look, let's have some of that.\NLet's celebrate! Get some glasses, Tilly. - Well, a couple of financial wizards.\N- Call us Rockefellers. Get a tray for these two\Ngreat big important simoleons here. We'll save them for seed. A toast. A toast. A toast to Mama Dollar\Nand to Papa Dollar, and if you want to keep this old\NBuilding and Loan in business, you better have a family real quick. - I wish they were rabbits.\N- I wish they were, too. Okay, let's put them in the safe\Nand see what happens. Close the door. Folks, folks, wedding cigars. Wedding. Holy mackerel, I'm married. Where's Mary? Mary! Poor... Look, I got a train to catch.\NWell, the train's gone. I wonder if Ernie's still here\Nwith his taxicab. George, there's a call for you. Look, will you get my wife\Non the phone? She's probably over at her mother's. Mrs. Bailey is on the phone. I don't want Mrs. Bailey. I want my wife. Mrs. Bailey! Oh, that's my wife.\NHere, I'll take it in here. Mary. Hello. Listen, dear, I'm sorry. Huh? Come home? What home? 320 Sycamore? Well, what...\NWhose home is that? The Waldorf Hotel, huh? Hey, this is the company's posters,\Nand the company won't like this. How would you like\Nto get a ticket next week? You got any romance in you? - Sure, I had it, but I got rid of it.\N- Liver pills. Who wants to see liver pills\Non their honeymoon? What we want is romantic places,\Nbeautiful places, places George wants to go. Hey, Bert. Here he comes. Come on, we got to get this up.\NHe's coming. - Who?\N- The groom, idiot. This is their honeymoon.\NCome on. Get that ladder. What are they, ducks? - Get that ladder up here.\N- All right, all right. - Hurry up. Hurry up. Hurry up.\N- I'm hurrying. Hiya... Good evening, sir. Welcome home, Mr. Bailey. Well, I'll be... Mary. Mary, where did you... Oh, Mary. Remember the night we broke\Nsome windows in this old house? This is what I wished for. You're wonderful. - Martini, you rented a new house?\N- Rent? - You hear what he say, Mr. Bailey?\N- What's that? I own the house. Me, Giuseppe Martini,\NI own my own house. No more we live like a pigs\Nin this Potter's Field. - Mary, Mary!\N- Mary, come on, bring the baby. I feel like a queen. - I'll take the kids in the car.\N- Oh, thank you, Mr. Bailey. Thank you. All right, kids, here. Here, get in here. Now, one at a time.\NGet right up on the seat there. - Sit down, there.\N- Here, now, get the dog, now. That's it. - Goat, too.\N- Everybody! All in! Bye-bye! Bye-bye! All in? Mr. And Mrs. Martini, welcome home. Good old George,\Nhe's always making a speech. Hee-haw! - Sam Wainwright.\N- Oh, who cares. Bread. That this house\Nmay never know hunger. Salt. That life may always have flavor. And wine. That joy and prosperity\Nmay reign forever. Enter the Martini castle. Look, Mr. Potter,\Nit's no skin off my nose. I'm just your little rent collector. But you can't laugh off\Nthis Bailey Park anymore. Look at it. Congressman Black is here\Nto see you, sir. Oh, tell the Congressman to wait.\NGo on. Fifteen years ago, a half a dozen\Nhouses stuck here and there. There's the old cemetery, squirrels,\Nbuttercups, daisies. I used to hunt rabbits there myself. Look at it today. Dozens of the prettiest little homes\Nyou ever saw, 90% owned by suckers\Nwho used to pay rent to you. Your Potter's Field, my dear\NMr. Employer, is becoming just that. And are the local yokels making with\Nthose David and Goliath wisecracks. Oh, they are, are they? Even though they know\Nthe Baileys never made a dime out of it. You know very well why.\NThe Baileys were all chumps. Every one of these homes is worth twice what it cost\Nthe Building and Loan to build. - If I were you, Mr. Potter...\N- You are not me. As I say, it's no skin off my nose, but one of these days\Nthis bright young man is gonna be asking\NGeorge Bailey for a job. The Bailey family has been\Na boil on my neck long enough. - Yes, sir?\N- Come in here. We just stopped in town\Nto take a look at the new factory, and then we're gonna\Ndrive on down to Florida. Why don't you\Nhave your friends join us? Why, sure. Hey, why don't you kids\Ndrive down with us, huh? Oh, I'm afraid I couldn't get away, Sam. Still got the nose\Nto the old grindstone, eh? Jane, I offered to let George in\Non the ground floor in plastics, and he turned me down cold. - Oh, now, don't rub it in.\N- I'm not rubbing it in. Well, I guess we better run along. - Awfully happy to have met you, Mary.\N- Nice meeting you, too. - Goodbye. Glad to see you.\N- Goodbye, George. So long, George.\NSee you in the funny papers. - So long, Mary.\N- Bye, Sam. Have fun. - Thanks for dropping around.\N- Florida! - Hee-haw!\N- Hee-haw. Thank you, sir. - That's quite a cigar, Mr. Potter.\N- You like it? I'll send you a box. Well, I... I suppose I'll find out sooner or later, but just what exactly\Ndid you want to see me about? George, now that's just what I like\Nso much about you. George, I am an old man,\Nand most people hate me. But I don't like them, either,\Nso that makes it all even. You know just as well as I do that I run practically everything\Nin this town but the Bailey Building and Loan. You know, also, that for a number of\Nyears I've been trying to get control of it. Or kill it. But I haven't been able to do it. You have been stopping me. In fact, you have beaten me, George, and as anyone in this county\Ncan tell you, that takes some doing. Take during the Depression,\Nfor instance. You and I were the only ones\Nthat kept our heads. You saved the Building and Loan.\NI saved all the rest. Yes. Well, most people say\Nyou stole all the rest. The envious ones say that,\NGeorge, the suckers. Now, I have stated my side very frankly. Now let's look at your side. Young man, 27-28, married,\Nmaking, say, $40 a week. - $45.\N- $45. $45. Out of which, after supporting\Nyour mother and paying your bills, you're able to keep, say, $10,\Nif you skimp. A child or two comes along, and you\Nwon't even be able to save the $10. Now, if this young man of 28\Nwas a common, ordinary yokel, I'd say he was doing fine. But George Bailey is not a common,\Nordinary yokel. He is an intelligent, smart,\Nambitious young man, who hates his job,\Nwho hates the Building and Loan almost as much as I do. A young man who's been dying to get\Nout on his own ever since he was born. A young man... The smartest one\Nof the crowd, mind you. A young man who has to sit by and watch his friends go places\Nbecause he's trapped. Yes, sir,\Ntrapped into frittering his life away, playing nursemaid\Nto a lot of garlic eaters. Do I paint a correct picture,\Nor do I exaggerate? - Now, what's your point, Mr. Potter?\N- My point? - My point is I want to hire you.\N- Hire me? Yeah, I want you to manage my affairs,\Nrun my properties. George, I'll start you out\Nat $20,000 a year. $20,000 a year? You wouldn't mind living\Nin the nicest house in town, buying your wife a lot of fine clothes, a couple of business trips\Nto New York a year, maybe once in a while Europe. You wouldn't mind that,\Nwould you, George? Would I? You're not talking to somebody else\Naround here, are you? You know, this is me.\NYou remember me? - George Bailey.\N- George Bailey. Yeah, George Bailey,\Nwhose ship has just come in. Provided he has enough brains\Nto climb aboard. Holy mackerel. Well, how about the Building and Loan? Oh, confound it, man,\Nare you afraid of success? I'm offering you a three-years contract\Nat $20,000 a year, starting today. Is it a deal, or isn't it? Well, Mr. Potter, I... I know I ought to jump\Nat the chance but I... I just... I wonder if it would be possible for you\Nto give me 24 hours to think it over? Sure, sure, sure. You go on home\Nand talk about it to your wife. I'd like to do that. Yeah. In the meantime,\NI'll draw up the papers. - All right, sir.\N- Okay, George? Okay, Mr. Potter. No. No. No, no,\Nnow wait a minute, here. I don't need 24 hours.\NI don't have to talk to anybody. I know right now, and the answer is no.\NNo, doggone it! You sit around here,\Nand you spin your little webs, and you think the whole world\Nrevolves around you and your money. Well, it doesn't, Mr. Potter. In the whole vast configuration of things, I'd say you were nothing\Nbut a scurvy little spider. You... And that goes for you, too! And it goes for you, too! You wouldn't mind living\Nin the nicest house in town, buying your wife a lot of fine clothes, going to New York on a business trip\Na couple of times a year, maybe Europe once in a while. I know what I'm gonna do tomorrow and the next day and next year\Nand the year after that. I'm shaking the dust\Nof this crummy little town off my feet, and I'm gonna see the world. And then I'm gonna build things.\NI'm gonna build air fields. I'm gonna build skyscrapers\N100 stories high. I'm gonna build a bridge a mile long. What is it you want, Mary?\NWhat, you want the moon? If you do, just say the word,\NI'll throw a lasso around it and pull her down for you. Buffalo gal\NWon't you come out tonight? Won't you come out tonight?\NWon't you come out tonight? Buffalo gal\NWon't you come out tonight And - Hi.\N- Hi. Mary Hatch, why in the world\Ndid you ever marry a guy like me? To keep from being an old maid. You could have\Nmarried Sam Wainwright and anybody else in town. I didn't want\Nto marry anybody else in town. I want my baby to look like you. You didn't even have a honeymoon. I promised you... - Your what?\N- My baby. Your... Your... Mary, you on the nest? - George Bailey lassoes stork.\N- Lassoes a stork! You mean you...\NWhat is it, a boy or a girl? Now, you've probably already guessed\Nthat George never leaves Bedford Falls. - No!\N- Mary had her baby, a boy. Then she had another one, a girl. Day after day she worked away, remaking the old Granville house\Ninto a home. Night after night,\NGeorge came back late from the office. Potter was bearing down hard. Then came a war. Ma Bailey and Mrs. Hatch\Njoined the Red Cross and sewed. Mary had two more babies\Nbut still found time to run the USO. Sam Wainwright made a fortune\Nin plastic hoods for planes. Potter became head of the draft board. One-A. Gower and Uncle Billy sold war bonds. Bert the cop was wounded\Nin North Africa, got the Silver Star. Ernie the taxi driver\Nparachuted into France. Marty helped capture\Nthe Remagen Bridge. Harry... Harry Bailey topped them all. A Navy flier, he shot down 15 planes, two of them as they were about\Nto crash into a transport full of soldiers. - Yes, but George.\N- George? Four-F on account of his ear, George fought the battle\Nof Bedford Falls. Now, hold on! Hold on! Hold on now! Don't you know there's a war on? Air raid warden. Paper drives. Scrap drives. Rubber drives. Like everybody else on VE Day,\Nhe wept and prayed. On VJ Day, he wept and prayed again. Joseph, now show him\Nwhat happened today. Yes, sir. This morning, day before Christmas,\Nabout 10:00 a.m. Bedford Falls time... Hey, Ernie. Look at that. It's gonna snow again. What do you mean, it's gonna snow?\NLook at the headlines. The President... I know, I know, George.\NThat's marvelous. Commander Harry Bailey! Mr. Gower, look at this,\Nthe second page. Now, look, this is for you. - This is for you. That's for you.\N- Okay. - Right, thanks.\N- See you again. Be sure you spell the name right. Extra! Read all about it! George, George! It's Harry now\Non long-distance from Washington. Harry! What do you know about that! He reversed the charges.\NIt's okay, isn't it? Reversed the charges?\NOf course it is for a hero. Harry! You old seven times\Na son of a gun. Congratulations. How's Mother standing it? She did? What do you know? Mother had lunch\Nwith the President's wife. Wait till Martha hears about this. - What did they have to eat?\N- What'd they have to eat? Harry, you should see what they're cooking up\Nin the town for you. Oh, they are? The Navy's gonna fly Mother home\Nthis afternoon. In a plane? What? Uncle Billy? - Has Uncle Billy come in yet?\N- He stopped at the bank first. He's not here right now, Harry.\NBut look, now, tell me about it. - George. George, George.\N- What? - That man is here again.\N- What man? Bank examiner. Harry, talk to Eustace for a minute,\Nwill you? I'll be right back. - Well...\N- Harry. - Good morning, sir.\N- Carter, bank examiner. - Mr. Carter, Merry Christmas.\N- Merry Christmas. We're all excited around here. My brother just got\Nthe Congressional Medal of Honor. - The President just decorated him.\N- Well, I guess they do those things. - Well, I trust you had a good year.\N- Good year? Well, between you and me,\NMr. Carter, we're broke. Yeah, very funny. Well, now,\Ncome right in here, Mr. Carter. Although I shouldn't wonder\Nwhen you okay reverse charges on personal long-distance calls. - George, shall we hang up?\N- No, no. He wants to talk to Uncle Billy.\NYou just hold on, there. Now, if you'll cooperate,\NI'd like to finish with you by tonight. I want to spend Christmas\Nin Elmira with my family. I don't blame you at all, Mr. Carter. Just step right in here. We'll fix you up. December 24. $8,000. - Merry Christmas, Mr. Potter.\N- Merry Christmas. Well, good morning, Mr. Potter.\NWhat's the news? Well, well, well, "Harry Bailey\Nwins Congressional Medal." That couldn't be one of the Bailey boys. You just can't keep those Baileys down,\Nnow can you, Mr. Potter? How does slacker George\Nfeel about that? Very jealous. Very jealous. He only lost three buttons off his vest. Of course,\Nslacker George would've gotten two of these medals if he had gone. - Bad ear.\N- Yes. After all, Potter, some people\Nlike George had to stay at home. Not every heel was\Nin Germany and Japan. - Good morning, Mr. Bailey.\N- Good morning, Horace. - I guess you forgot something.\N- Huh? - You forgot something.\N- What? Well, aren't you going\Nto make a deposit? Oh, sure, sure I am. Well, then, it's usually customary\Nto bring the money with you. Oh, shucks, I knew I had. How about that finger there? Well, I... Bailey. Take me back there. Hurry up. Come on, look sharp. Take me back. Just make yourself at home, Mr. Carter.\NI got those books for you here. Oh, hello, Vi. George, can I see you for a second? Why, of course you can.\NGo on in the office there. Uncle Billy, talk to Harry.\NHe's on the telephone. Hurry up, Uncle Billy, hurry.\NLong distance, Washington. Hey, here's Harry on the phone. You know, your nephew,\Nremember? Harry. - Here he is.\N- Hurry up. Hello? Hello.\NYes, Harry, yes, everything's fine. I ought to have my head examined. $8,000. It's got to be somewhere. Here you are. Character? If I had any character, I'd... It takes a lot of character to leave\Nyour hometown and start all over again. No, George, don't. Here now, you're broke, aren't you? - I know, but...\N- What do you want to do, hock your furs and that hat? You want to walk to New York? You know, they charge\Nfor meals and rent up there, just the same as they do\Nin Bedford Falls. - Yeah, sure.\N- No, that's a loan, now. That's my business, Building and Loan. Besides, you'll get a job.\NGood luck to you. I'm glad I know you, George Bailey. - Say hello to New York for me.\N- Yeah, yeah, sure, I will. Now, let's hear from you\Nonce in a while. - Merry Christmas, Vi.\N- Merry Christmas, George. - Mr. Bailey.\N- Oh, Mr. Carter, I'm sorry. I'll be right with you.\NUncle Billy in there? Yeah, he's in his office. What's going on? The bank examiner's here. - He's here?\N- Yeah. He wants the accounts payable... What's the matter with you? Come here. Eustace. - Yeah?\N- Come here a minute. Did you see Uncle Billy\Nwith any cash last night? He had it on his desk counting it\Nbefore he closed up. Now, look, did you buy anything? - Nothing. Not even a stick of gum.\N- All right, all right. Now, we'll go over every step you took\Nsince you left the house. - Right. This way.\N- Come on. And did you put the envelope\Nin your pocket? Yeah, maybe, maybe. Maybe! I don't want any maybe.\NWe've got to find that money! - I'm no good to you, George.\N- Uncle Billy, look, do you realize what's going\Nto happen if we don't find it? Listen to me. Do you have any secret hiding place\Nhere in the house? Someplace you would have...\NSomeplace you hide the money? I've gone over the whole house, even in rooms that have been locked\Nsince I lost Laura. Listen to me, listen to me! Think, think! I can't think anymore, George.\NI can't think anymore. It hurts. Where's that money,\Nyou silly, stupid old fool? Where's that money?\NDo you realize what this means? It means bankruptcy and scandal\Nand prison! That's what it means. One of us is going to jail.\NWell, it's not going to be me. Hello, darling. - Hello, Daddy.\N- Hello, Daddy. How do you like it? - Bless you!\N- Bless you! Did you bring the wreath? Yes, Daddy, did you bring\Nthe Christmas wreath? What wreath? The Merry Christmas wreath\Nfor the window. No. I left it at the office. - Is it snowing?\N- Yeah, it just started. - Where's your coat and hat?\N- Left them at the office. What's the matter? Nothing's the matter.\NEverything's all right. Come on, Pete, you're a big boy.\NYou can help me get this star up. Way up at the top. There. That's it. All right, fill in that little bare spot\Nright there. Right there. Isn't it wonderful about Harry?\NWe're famous, George. Bet I had 50 calls today\Nabout the parade, the banquet. Your mother's so excited. She... Must she keep playing that? I have to practice it\Nfor the party tonight, Daddy. Mama said we could stay up\Ntill midnight and sing Christmas carols. Can you sing, Daddy? Better hurry and shave. - The families will be here soon.\N- Families. I don't want the families over here. Come on out in the kitchen with me\Nwhile I finish dinner. Excuse me. Excuse me. - Have a hectic day?\N- Oh, yeah. Another big red-letter day\Nfor the Baileys. Daddy, the Browns next door\Nhave a new car. You should see it. Well, what's the matter with our car?\NIsn't it good enough for you? Yes, Daddy. Excuse me. Excuse me. - Excuse you for what?\N- I burped. All right, darling, you're excused. Now, go on upstairs\Nand see if little Zuzu wants anything. - Zuzu? What's the matter with Zuzu?\N- Oh, she's just got a cold. She's in bed. Caught it coming home from school. They gave her a flower for a prize,\Nand she didn't want to crush it, so she didn't button up her coat. - What is it, a sore throat or what?\N- It's just a cold. - The doctor says it's nothing serious.\N- The doctor? - Was the doctor here?\N- Yes, I called him right away. He says it's nothing to worry about. Is she running a temperature?\NWhat is it? Just a teensy one, 99.6.\NShe'll be all right. Of course, it's this old house. I don't know why\Nwe don't all have pneumonia. Drafty old barn.\NMight as well be living in a refrigerator. Why did we have\Nto live here in the first place and stay around this measly,\Ncrummy old town? - George, what's wrong?\N- Wrong! Everything's wrong. You call this a happy family?\NWhy do we have to have all these kids? - Dad, how do you spell "frankincense"?\N- I don't know. Ask your mother. - Where're you going?\N- I'm going up to see Zuzu. He told me to write a play for tomorrow. F-r-a-n-k-i-n... Hi, Daddy! - Well, what happened to you?\N- I won a flower. Wait now.\NWhere do you think you're going? I want to give my flower a drink. All right, all right.\NNow, give Daddy the flower. I'll give it a drink. Now, here. Look, Daddy! Paste it! Yeah, all right, all right. Give it here. Now, we'll paste this together here. There. There it is. Good as new. Now, give the flower a drink. Now, will you do something for me? - What?\N- Will you try to get some sleep? I'm not sleepy.\NI want to look at my flower. I know, I know, but you just go to sleep\Nand then you can dream about it, and it'll be a whole garden. It will? - Telephone!\N- Telephone! I'll get it. Hello? Yes, this is Mrs. Bailey. Oh, thank you, Mrs. Welch.\NI'm sure she'll be all right. The doctor said\Nthat she ought to be out of bed in time to have her Christmas dinner. - Is that Zuzu's teacher?\N- Yes. Let me speak to her. Hello. Hello, Mrs. Welch? This is George Bailey. I'm Zuzu's father. Say, what kind of a teacher\Nare you, anyway? What do you mean\Nsending her home like that, half naked? Do you realize she'll probably end up\Nwith pneumonia on account of you? - George!\N- Is this the sort of thing we pay taxes for to have teachers like you? Stupid, silly, careless people who send\Nour kids home without any clothes on? You know, maybe my kids\Naren't the best-dressed kids. And maybe they don't have\Nany decent clothes... That stupid... Hello, Mrs. Welch. I want to apologize... Hello? Hello. - She's hung up!\N- I'll hang her up! - Hey, you! I'll knock your block off!\N- What is that? Hello! Who's this? Oh, Mr. Welch? Okay, that's fine, Mr. Welch. Give me a chance to tell you\Nwhat I really think of your wife. George, stop it. Will you get out and let me handle this? Hello? Hello? What? Oh, you will, huh? Okay, Mr. Welch. Any time\Nyou think you're man enough, you... Hello! Any... Dad, how do you spell "hallelujah"? How should I know?\NWhat do you think I am, a dictionary? Tommy, stop that! Stop it! Janie, haven't you learned\Nthat silly tune yet? You play it over and over again.\NNow stop it! Stop it! I'm sorry, Mary. Janie, I'm sorry. I didn't mean that. I...\NYou go on and practice. Pete, I owe you an apology, too. I'm sorry. - What do you want to know?\N- Nothing, Daddy. What's the matter with everybody? Janie, go on. I told you to practice.\NNow, go on, play! Oh, Daddy! George, why must you\Ntorture the children? Why don't you... Mary... Bedford 247, please. - Is Daddy in trouble?\N- Yes, Pete. - Shall I pray for him?\N- Yes, Janie, pray very hard. - Me, too?\N- You, too, Tommy. Hello? Uncle Billy? I'm in trouble, Mr. Potter. I need help. Through some sort of an accident,\Nmy company's short in their accounts. The bank examiner got there today. I've got to raise $8,000 immediately. Oh, that's what the reporters wanted\Nto talk to you about? - The reporters?\N- Yes. They called me up\Nfrom your Building and Loan. Oh, there's a man over there\Nfrom the D.A.'s office, too. He's looking for you. Please help me, Mr. Potter.\NHelp me, won't you, please? Can't you see what it means\Nto my family? I'll pay any sort of a bonus on the loan,\Nany interest, if you still want the Building and Loan... George, could it possibly be there's\Na slight discrepancy in the books? No, sir.\NThere's nothing wrong with the books. I've just misplaced $8,000.\NI can't find it anywhere. - You misplaced $8,000?\N- Yes, sir. - Have you notified the police?\N- No, sir. I didn't want the publicity. - Harry's homecoming tomorrow...\N- They're going to believe that one. What've you been doing, George? Playing the market\Nwith the company's money? No, sir. No, sir, I haven't. Is it a woman, then? You know, it's all over town that\Nyou've been giving money to Violet Bick. What? Not that it makes any difference to me,\Nbut why did you come to me? Why don't you go to Sam Wainwright\Nand ask him for the money? I can't get a hold of him. He's in Europe. Well, what about all your other friends? They don't have that kind of money,\NMr. Potter. You know that. You're the only one in town\Nthat can help me. I've suddenly become quite important. What kind of security\Nwould I have, George? - Have you got any stocks?\N- No, sir. Bonds? Real estate?\NCollateral of any kind? I have some life insurance,\Na $15,000 policy. - Yes. How much is your equity in it?\N- Five hundred dollars. Five hundred dollars? And you ask me to lend you $8,000? Look at you. You used to be so cocky. You were going to go out\Nand conquer the world. You once called me a warped,\Nfrustrated old man. What are you but a warped,\Nfrustrated young man? A miserable little clerk, crawling in here\Non your hands and knees and begging for help. No securities, no stocks, no bonds. Nothing but a miserable\Nlittle $500 equity in a life insurance policy. You're worth more dead than alive. Why don't you go to the riffraff\Nyou love so much and ask them to let you have $8,000? You know why? Because they'd run you\Nout of town on a rail. But I tell you\Nwhat I'm going to do for you, George. Since the state examiner is still here, as a stockholder\Nof the Building and Loan, I'm going to swear out\Na warrant for your arrest. Misappropriation of funds,\Nmanipulation, malfeasance. All right, George, go ahead. You can't hide in a little town like this. Yeah, Bill? This is Potter. Merry Christmas! Glad you come! How about some of that good spaghetti? We got everything. Oh, God. Dear Father in Heaven, I'm not a praying man, but if you're up there\Nand you can hear me, show me the way. I'm at the end of my rope. I... Show me the way, O God. Are you all right, George?\NWant somebody to take you home? Why you drink so much, my friend? Please go home, Mr. Bailey.\NThis is Christmas Eve. Bailey? Which Bailey? This is Mr. George Bailey. The next time you talk to my wife\Nlike that, you'll get worse! She cried for an hour! It isn't enough she slaves teaching\Nyour stupid kids how to read and write, - and you have to bawl her out.\N- You get out of here, Mr. Welch! Now, wait, I want to pay for my drink. Never mind the money!\NYou get out of here quick! - All right!\N- You hit my best friend! Get out! - You all right, George?\N- Who was that? He gone. No worry. He name is Welch. - He no come into my place no more.\N- Oh, Welch. That's what I get for praying. The last time he come in here.\NYou hear that, Nick? Yes, you bet. Where's my insurance policy?\NOh, here it is. Oh, no, please,\Ndon't go this way, Mr. Bailey. - I'm all right.\N- No, no, you no feel so good. - Sit down and rest.\N- I'm all right. Please no go away, please! What do you think you're doing? Now look what you did.\NMy great-grandfather planted this tree! Hey, you! Hey, you! Come back here, you drunken fool!\NGet this car out of here! Hey, what's the matter with you?\NLook where you're going. Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! I didn't have time\Nto get some stylish underwear. Wife gave me this\Non my last birthday. I passed away in it. Oh, Tom Sawyer's drying out, too. You should read the new book\NMark Twain's writing now. How did you happen to fall in? I didn't fall in.\NI jumped in to save George. You what? To save me? Well, I did, didn't I?\NYou didn't go through with it, did you? - Go through with what?\N- Suicide. It's against the law\Nto commit suicide around here. Yeah, it's against the law\Nwhere I come from, too. - Where do you come from?\N- Heaven. I had to act quickly.\NThat's why I jumped in. I knew if I were drowning,\Nyou'd try to save me. You see, you did,\Nand that's how I saved you. Very funny. Your lip's bleeding, George. Yeah, I got a bust in the jaw\Nin answer to a prayer a little bit ago. Oh, no, no, no, George,\NI'm the answer to your prayer. That's why I was sent down here. - How'd you know my name?\N- Oh, I know all about you. I've watched you grow up\Nfrom a little boy. What are you,\Na mind reader or something? No. - Well, who are you then?\N- Clarence Oddbody, AS2. Oddbody? AS2? What's that, AS2? Angel Second Class. Cheerio, my good man. Oh, brother. Gee whiz. I wonder what Martini\Nput in those drinks. Hey, what's with you?\NWhat did you say just a minute ago? Why'd you want to save me? That's what I was sent down for.\NI'm your guardian angel. I wouldn't be a bit surprised. Ridiculous of you to think\Nof killing yourself for money, $8,000. Yeah, now, just things like that...\NHow do you know that? I told you. I'm your guardian angel.\NI know everything about you. Well, you look about\Nlike the kind of an angel I'd get. Sort of a fallen angel, aren't you?\NWhat happened to your wings? I haven't won my wings yet.\NThat's why I'm an Angel Second Class. I don't know whether I'd like it very much being seen around\Nwith an angel without any wings. Oh, I've got to earn them,\Nand you'll help me, won't you? Sure, sure. - How?\N- By letting me help you. Yes. Only one way you can help me. You don't happen to have\N8,000 bucks on you, do you? Oh, no. No.\NWe don't use money in heaven. Oh, yeah, that's right, I keep forgetting. - Comes in pretty handy down here, bub.\N- Oh, tut, tut, tut. I found it out a little late. I'm worth more dead than alive. Now, look, you mustn't talk like that.\NI won't get my wings with that attitude. You just don't know all that you've done.\NIf it hadn't been for you... Yeah, if it hadn't been for me,\Neverybody'd be a lot better off. My wife and my kids and my friends. I mean, look, little fellow, go off\Nand haunt somebody else, will you? No, now, you don't understand.\NI've got my job... Oh, shut up, will you? Oh, this isn't gonna be so easy. Yeah, so you still think killing yourself\Nwould make everyone feel happier, eh? Well, I don't know. I guess you're right. I suppose it would have been better\Nif I'd never been born at all. - What'd you say?\N- I said I wish I'd never been born. Oh, you mustn't say things like that. You... Wait a minute. Wait a minute.\NThat's an idea. What do you think? Yeah, that'll do it. All right. You've got your wish.\NYou've never been born. You don't have\Nto make all that fuss about it! What did you say? You've never been born. You don't exist.\NYou haven't a care in the world. No worries, no obligations,\Nno $8,000 to get, no Potter looking for you\Nwith the Sheriff. - Say something else in that ear.\N- Sure, you can hear out of it. Well, that's the doggonedest thing. I haven't heard anything out of that ear\Nsince I was a kid. Must have been that jump\Nin that cold water. Your lip stopped bleeding, too, George. What do you know about that?\NWhat's happening? It stopped snowing out here, didn't it? What's happened here? What I need\Nis a couple of good stiff drinks. How about you, Angel?\NYou want a drink? Come on,\Nsoon as these clothes of ours are dry... The clothes are dry. What do you know about that?\NStove's hotter than I thought. Now, come on, get your clothes on.\NWe'll stroll up to my car and get... Oh, I'm sorry. I'll stroll. You fly. I can't fly. I haven't got my wings. You haven't got your wings.\NYeah, that's right. What's the matter? Well, this is where I left my car,\Nand it isn't here. - You have no car.\N- Well, I had a car, and it was right here. I guess somebody moved it. - Good evening.\N- Oh, say, hey, where's my car? - I beg your pardon?\N- My car, my car. I'm the fellow that owns the car\Nthat ran into your tree. - What tree?\N- What do you mean, what tree? This tree. Here, I ran into it. Cut a big gash in the side of it there. You must mean two other trees.\NYou had me worried. One of the oldest trees in Pottersville. Pottersville? Why, you mean Bedford Falls. I mean Pottersville.\NDon't you think I know where I live? What's the matter with you? What's the matter with me?\NWell, I guess I just... Oh, I don't know.\NEither I'm off my nut or he is or you are. It isn't me. Well, maybe I left the car\Nup at Martini's. - Well, come on, Gabriel.\N- Clarence. Clarence. Clarence. That's all right. Go on in.\NMartini is a friend of mine. There's a place to sit down. Sit down. - Oh, hello, Nick. Hey, where's Martini?\N- Want a martini? No, no, Martini. Your boss.\NWhere is he? Hey, look, I'm the boss.\NYou want a drink or don't you? Okay, all right. Double bourbon,\Nwill you, and quick, huh? Okay. - What's yours?\N- I was just thinking. It's been so long since I... Look, mister, I'm standing here\Nwaiting for you to make up your mind. That's a good man. I was just thinking of a flaming rum punch. No, it's not cold enough for that,\Nnot nearly cold enough. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. I got it. Mulled wine, heavy on the cinnamon\Nand light on the cloves. Off with you, me lad, and be lively! Hey, look, mister,\Nwe serve hard drinks in here for men who want to get drunk fast. And we don't need any characters\Naround to give the joint atmosphere. Is that clear, or do I have\Nto slip you my left for a convincer? What's he talking about? Nick, Nick,\Njust give him the same as mine. - He's okay.\N- Okay. What's the matter with him?\NI never saw Nick act like that before. You'll see a lot of strange things\Nfrom now on. Oh, yeah. Hey, little fellow,\Nyou worry me, you know. - You got someplace to sleep?\N- No. You don't, huh? - Well, you got any money?\N- No. No wonder you jumped in the river. I jumped in the river to save you\Nso I could get my wings. - Somebody's just made it.\N- Made what? Every time you hear a bell ring, it means\Nthat some angel's just got his wings. Look, I think maybe you\Nbetter not mention getting your wings around here. Why? Don't they believe in angels? Yeah, they believe in them. Oh, why should they be surprised\Nwhen they see one? Oh, he never grew up. He's... - How old are you anyway, Clarence?\N- Two hundred and ninety-three, next May. That does it. Out, you two pixies! Go through the door or out the window. - Look, Nick, what's wrong?\N- Now, that's another thing. Where do you come off\Ncalling me Nick? Well, Nick, that's your name. What's that got to do with it?\NI don't know you from Adam's off ox. Hey. Hey, you rummy, there.\NCome here, come here. Didn't I tell you never to come\Npanhandling around here, huh? Mr. Gower. What... What did... Mr. Gower, look, this is George Bailey. - Don't you know me?\N- No. No. Throw him out. Throw him out. Mr. Gower! Hey, what is... Hey, Nick. Nick.\NIsn't that Mr. Gower, the druggist? You know, that's another reason\Nfor me not to like you. That rum head spent 20 years in jail\Nfor poisoning a kid. If you know him,\Nyou must be a jailbird yourself. Would you show these gentlemen\Nto the door? Sure. This way, gentlemen. Stay out. Get me! I'm giving out wings! You see, George,\Nyou were not there to stop Gower from putting that poison\Ninto the capsules. What do you mean, I wasn't there?\NI remember distinctly... Hey, what's going on around here? What... Why, this ought to be Martini's place. Look, who are you? I told you, George.\NI'm your guardian angel. Yeah, yeah, I know. You told me that. What else are you?\NWhat, are you a hypnotist? No. Of course not. Well, then, why am I seeing\Nall these strange things here? Don't you understand, George?\NIt's because you were not born. - Well, if I wasn't born, who am I?\N- You're nobody. You have no identity. What do you mean, no identity?\NMy name's George Bailey. There is no George Bailey. You have no papers, no cards,\Nno driver's license, no 4-F card, no insurance policy. They're not there, either. - What?\N- Zuzu's petals. You've been given a great gift, George, a chance to see what the world\Nwould be like without you. Now, wait a minute here.\NWait a minute here. This is some sort of a funny dream\NI'm having. So long, mister. I'm going home. - Home? What home?\N- Shut up! Cut it out! You're crazy!\NThat's what I think. You're screwy. You're driving me crazy, too.\NI'm seeing things here. I'm going home\Nand see my wife and family. You understand that?\NAnd I'm going home alone. How am I doing, Joseph? Thanks. No, I didn't have a drink. Hey, hey, where did\Nthe Building and Loan move to? Building and what? The Bailey Building and Loan.\NIt was up there. They went out of business years ago. That sailor's a liar! I know every big shot in this town! I know Potter,\Nand I'll have you kicked off the beat. Hey, Violet! Hey, hey! Listen. That's Violet Bick. - I know.\N- I know that girl! Take a walk. Beat it. Hey, Ernie! Ernie. Ernie, take me home.\NI'm going off my nut. Where do you live? Now, doggone it, Ernie,\Ndon't you start pulling that stuff. You know where I live. 320 Sycamore.\NNow hurry up. - All right. 320 Sycamore?\N- Yeah, yeah, hurry up. Zuzu's sick. - Come on.\N- All right. All right. Come on, Ernie,\Nnow straighten me out here. Look, I've got some bad liquor\Nor something. Listen to me. Now, you are Ernie Bishop, and you live in Bailey Park\Nwith your wife and kid? - That's right, isn't it?\N- You seen my wife? Seen your wife?\NI've been to your house 100 times.
