I know we haven't been\Ntogether that long, but these last ten months\Nhave just been the happiest of my life. You're not only the person I love,\Nyou're also my best friend, and I want to spend\Nthe rest of my life with you. Will you marry me? Yes. Seriously.\NDo you think that sounds good? - No! - Really? 'Cause I think\Nthat kinda sums up-- - No!\N- Oh? Oh, sorry. Sorry. Sometimes these catheters\Ncan pinch a little bit. Well, thanks for listening.\NI really appreciate it. You've got a real gentle\Ntouch there, Doctor. She won't be able to say no. Actually, I'm a nurse.\NDoctor'll be right in. - Good luck, Greg.\N- Thanks, Kim. - Good luck, buddy. Okay, it's time\Nfor our problem of the week. I want you to pick out\Nyour problem-- a problem that's been\Nbothering you all week-- With your eyes still closed, I want you to picture\Nthat problem in your mind. Pretend that it's right there\Nin front of you. Not only are you my best friend, but you're also the person\NI wanna spend the rest of my life with. I love you.\NWill you... marry me? Now I want you to scare your problems away.\NI want you to say boo. All right, you guys are great. Very good. I will see you guys\Nafter lunch, all right? Hey, Pam, isn't that\Nyour special friend outside? Yeah, I think so. Why don't you go\Ntalk to him? - You think I should?\N- Yeah. Come here. Come here. - Hi, sweetie.\N- How you doin'? - What's going on?\N- I was in the neighborhood, got off work early. Thought maybe you wanted\Nto get a bite to eat. Oh, that's very sweet.\NWhat a nice surprise. Oh, shoot, I forgot\Nto change my shoes. You don't have to change.\NI can't resist a man in nurse's shoes. I know, but I got sneakers\Nin my backpack. - It'll just take a second.\N- Okay. honey-- Pam, I love you. I love you too.\NCome on, sweetie. I got a half hour before I have to be back,\Nso you wanna go have lunch? - What are you doing?\N- Um, nothing. I just love you so much. These last ten months\Nhave been the happiest of my life. Yeah, they've been amazing.\NWhat's going on? Nothing. I just-- I just--\NI just feel like we're so close. You're my best friend, and you're also\Nthe woman that I love, and-- Are you okay, sweetie?\NYou're acting so weird. I'm fine. I just got a crick in my neck.\NI was doing C.P.R.... ...on a 300-pound crack addict\Nthis morning. - Oh, my goodness! Do you want me to massage\Nyour neck or something? - No, no, no, I'm fine, I'm good.\N- A back rub? Are you sure? Honey, look, your kids--\Nthey're trying to tell you something. - What? Hold on.\N- Look! - Oh, it's my sister. Hello? Hi!\N- I'm engaged! You're engaged! That's wonderful.\NCongratulations! Oh, my God, you're getting\Nmarried in two weeks. That's a little soon. Wow, Mom and Dad really don't know\NBob very well. Dad was okay with this? Well, Bob asked Dad.\NWow, that was very thoughtful of him. I can't believe he knew\Nto ask Dad's permission. I'm just here with Greg.\NHe's gonna take me out for lunch. He's okay. Okay, yeah, I know you gotta go.\NI love you. Okay, talk to you soon.\NBye. -So what's going on? What?\NDebbie's marrying that guy?\N- Yeah, in two weeks. Dr. Bob of Denver.\NIsn't that great? Yeah, yeah, that's--\NDidn't they just meet like a few months ago? Well, yeah, but, you know, he asked her,\Nand she said yes. He asked my dad. He said yes.\NThen he asked Debbie. Huh? Yeah, I overheard that.\NSo, what, like he had to ask his permission? No, no, he didn't have to. Bob just understood that Dad appreciates\Nthat kind of thing. Anyway, Deb said\NDad's crazy about him. Evidently, Bob bought him, like, the\Nperfect gift that just won him over. Really? Huh?\NA gift? Are you sure it's okay\Nto X-ray this? Yeah, it's not gonna mutate\Nor anything. - Uh, sir, that's not gonna fit.\N- Wait. Hang on a second. The bag's too big, guy.\NYou gotta check it. Over here. Raise your arms, sir. I've got an engagement ring\Nfor my girlfriend in the bag. I can't open it here. Don't you think\NI can just carry it on? Hey, pal, if it ain't fittin' through the\Nframe, you ain't carryin' it on the plane. - 531 -- New York La Guardia.\NCheck it. - Wait, wait! - Excuse me! - Don't worry.\NIt'll be waitin' for you on the other side. <i>Baby, hurry\NDon't make me worry</i> Welcome to New York's\NLa Guardia Airport. Excuse me. Hi. You lost my bag, and there's a\Ntwo-carat diamond ring inside it. I didn't lose\Nyour anything, sir. But put your local address on this form,\Nand we'll ship it when it surfaces. And what if it doesn't? Am I supposed\Nto spend the entire weekend... with just the clothes\Non my back? It's a great gift. I just thought you\Nwere gonna get them champagne. Trust me. I think your dad is gonna\Nbe very psyched about this gift. Well, don't forget\Nhe's retired, though. The guy was in the rare-flower\Nbusiness for 30 years. I think\Nhe still maintains an interest. - You make it sound like\Nthey're really hard to please.\N- No, not at all! He's the sweetest man\Nin the whole world. Just relax! He's gonna love you.\NI promise. As much as he loves Dr. Bob? Take it easy on the sarcasm.\NHumor is entirely wasted on my parents. What, are they Amish? Okay, no jokes. - What are you doing?\N- What? I told you my dad sees smoking\Nas a sign of weakness. Okay, all right,\NI'll leave 'em in the car. No, no, no, no, he'll check there.\NOh, gosh. Yeah, the roof is probably\Na better idea. ...we're not living together. - I thought you said you told him.\N- Well-- - I missed you so much, Pamcake.\N- I missed you too, Flapjack. Short stack, short stack,\Ncoming up. Where's my "wittle" girl? - Mommy! Mom!\N- You look so beautiful. So do you. Look at you. Oh, I'm sorry.\NMom, Dad, this is Greg. - Hi, Greg. I'm Pam's father, Jack Byrnes.\N- Great to finally meet you. - Good meeting you. - And I'm Dina.\NWelcome to Oyster Bay. What are you driving there,\Na Ford? Oh, yeah, it's a Taurus. We were gonna get a mid-size,\Nbut I figure, hey, we pull down decent bucks. Might as well go all out,\Npop for the full-size. Sure. Interesting color.\NYou pick it? Oh, no, the guy at the counter.\NWhy? Well, they say\Ngeniuses pick green. - But you didn't pick it.\N- Jack! Oh, yucky.\NWhat smells of old sour milk? - Oh, poor Greg got spit up on by a baby.\N- He didn't. Yeah, he did, Ma, at the lost luggage\Ncounter. The airline lost his bag. They didn't! - Yeah.\N- Yeah, they did. - What about you, honey?\N- Oh, no, no, no. I carried on. That's my girl. It'll turn up, I'm sure.\NAnd anyway, Greg, meanwhile,\Nanything you need, just ask. - That's right. Mi casa es su casa.\N- Oh, thanks, Jack. You too. - This is so nice.\N- We like it. Beautiful. Oh, now, Greg, you have\Na very unique last name. Um, we were curious,\Nhow do you pronounce it? Oh, just like it's spelled.\NF-O-C-K-E-R. Focker.\NHmm, Focker. Hmm. - Oh, I'll get it, honey.\N- Oh, thanks, Mom. - Oh, there he is. There's our little guy.\N-Jinxy, come here, boy. Come here, baby. Come to Daddy, Jinxy.\NCome on. Come on, Jinxy. Come here.\NCome to Daddy. Come on.\NTaught him that in one week. This is Pam's cat, Jinxy.\NJinxy, say hello to Greg. - Hi, Jinx. - Wave to Greg.\N- Hello, Jinx. Attaboy.\NThat took me another week. - Oh, my gosh.\N- Pam, I didn't know you had a cat. Yeah, I left him here\Nwhen I moved to Chicago. Your daddy's\Nfound his new best friend. You won't believe it.\NHe even taught him to use the potty. - He did? Dad, that's kinda weird, isn't it?\N- What's so weird about it? - Now we don't have to smell\Nkitty litter all the time. - That's right. That's incredible. How did you teach\Nthe cat to use the toilet? Oh, that was easy, Greg. I just designed\Na litter box to put inside the toilet, and then once he got used to it,\NI took it away. - Yeah, makes sense.\N- But I don't think he likes it. I mean, every chance he gets,\Nhe tries to dig, squat and bury. I had to move all my\Npotted plants off the floor. Plus, you got another guy\Naround the house to leave the seat up. He can't lift the seat, Greg. - He lacks the strength\Nand the opposable thumbs. - Yeah. Ah, right. Opposable--\NI didn't think about that. Jinx is strictly a house cat.\NCan't let him outside because he\Nlacks outdoor survival skills. One of those things,\Nisn't it, sweetheart? I don't think Greg will be playing\Nwith Jinxy too much. He hates cats. Pam, I don't hate cats. I don't-- I don't hate cats.\NI just happen to be more of a dog lover. Yeah, yeah. I am too. - Well, that's okay if you hate cats, Greg.\N- No! - I don't. I don't hate cats at all.\N- That's okay. Just be honest about it.\NThere's some things I hate. I-- I'm being honest.\NReally? Like what? Honey, why don't we let\Nthe kids freshen up, huh? Greg, you come with me.\NWe'll get you something to wear\Nfrom Jack's closet, okay? - Yeah?\N- I'm so happy you're home, sweetheart. Oh! Me too, Dad. Hey, listen, be nice to this one, okay?\NI kinda like him. - Okay, I'll try.\N- Thank you. - Shirt fit okay, Greg?\N- Oh, fantastic. Thanks, Jack. Good.\NTom Collins coming up. - You know, I wish you hadn't\Ntold your parents I hate cats.\N- But you do hate cats. Yeah, but you didn't have to\Ntell them right when we met. I know. I'm sorry.\NIt just kinda slipped out. - Get your red-hot papooses.\N- My goodness, what is that? Oh, that's just a little something from me.\NGo ahead. Open it up. Oh. Look, honey,\NGreg brought us a present. Oh, isn't that nice? Oh, look at this. It's a flower pot\Nwith the dirt in it. Actually, the real gift is\Nwhat's planted in the soil. The bulb\Nof a Jerusalem tulip. Which I was told is one of the rarest\Nand most beautiful flowers in existence. Oh, right, right,\Nthe Jerusalem-- From the "Jerusales tulipesias" genus.\NYes, yes. Anyway, yeah, the guy said with regular watering,\Nit should bloom in about 6 months, so-- Oh, we'll look forward\Nto that, Greg. So, Greg, how's your job? Um, good, Pam.\NThanks for asking. I, uh, I recently\Ngot transferred to triage. Oh, is that better than a nurse? No, Mom, triage is\Na unit of the E.R. - It's where all the top nurses work.\N- Well-- No, they do. Not many men in your profession, though,\Nare there, Greg? No, Jack, not traditionally. Oh, Pam, honey, did you know\Nthat your father started his own business? Really?\NDad, that's great. Yes, I thought with my knowledge\Nand experience, why should I allow\Nretirement to stop me? - I really admire that.\N- Yeah. So what is it?\NWhat's the new venture? Let me ask you a question, Greg. Let's just say\Nyou have kids... and you wanna get out of the house,\Nspend a night on the town. So, you hire a baby-sitter,\Nsomeone you think you can trust. References, work experience--\Nit all checks out fine. But then how do you\Nreally know for certain... that your loved ones are safe\Nwith this stranger? I mean, can you ever really trust another\Nhuman being, Greg? Sure, I think so. No, the answer is you cannot. Let me show you something. Take a look at this, Greg. What's this look like to you? This looks like\Na teddy bear. Smile, you're on "Nanny Camera." I've seen these things\Nadvertised on TV. Oh, no, not like this, you haven't.\NTake a look. Oh, my gosh.\NHi! - Where's the other camera?\N- Right here in this decorative artifact. - Wow, that's great.\N- Our cameras are motion-activated, so they begin taping as soon as\Nthey sense any movement. We can hide 'em in anything.\NWe hide 'em in mirrors, lamps,\Ntelevisions, you name it. So no matter where you go, we'll be watching you. So, Jack, couldn't this\Nmaybe be construed as illegal?\NYou know, invasion of privacy? Trust me, Greg, when you\Nstart having little Fockers running around, you'll understand the need\Nfor this level of protection. Impressive, isn't it? Quite. - Oh, I'll get that.\N- I'll get it. I'll get it. Honey, I'll get it. Any problem\Nwith the documents? Okay. I'll meet you at the\NOyster Bay Drugstore in about 20 minutes. Now you gotta be more careful\Nwhen you call here. If anybody else answers,\Njust use a Southern accent... and ask for\Nthe vegetarian special, okay? Oh, that wasn't the airline, was it? Nope, wrong number. We're all out of Collins mix,\Nso I'm gonna make a run for the store. That's funny.\NI thought I just bought some. You know how that stuff-- it just goes,\Nso I'll be back in a jiff. Well, why doesn't Greg\Ngo with you? Sweetie, you'll need something\Nin case your suitcase doesn't show up. - Oh, I'm sure it'll show up.\N- Yeah. You don't wanna take a chance.\NYou don't have a toothbrush.\NGo on, sweetie. - Yeah.\N- Okay, unless you want some privacy. Why would I need privacy? No, I didn't think you would. - Okay, let's head out.\N- Oh, good. Bye. Have fun, you guys.\NPam, he seems wonderful. - He is. We have the best time together.\N- Good. Now, have you two been - Mother!\N- Oh, thinking about anything permanent. Oh, I don't know.\NI mean, we haven't really discussed it, but I definitely\Nhave a feeling this is it. Dad seems to like him.\NDon't you think? Absolutely. Big day, Saturday. Yes.\NThis car is-- You got-- What do you use?\NUnleaded? Regular unleaded? Premium. Hey, you know, Jack,\Nnow that we have a second to talk, I just want you to know\Nhow much Pam means to me. I know-- I know that we haven't been\Ntogether that long, but the time that we have spent together\Nhas been really incredible. Greg, how come\Nyou don't like cats? I don't not like cats. I- just--\NI just prefer dogs. I mean, I'm just more of a dog kind of,\Nyou know-- Come home, wagging their little tails,\Nhappy to see you kind of-- You need that assurance?\NYou prefer an emotionally shallow animal? You see, Greg,\Nwhen you yell at a dog, his tail will go between\Nhis legs and cover his genitals,\Nhis ears will go down. A dog is very easy to break,\Nbut cats make you work for their affection. They don't sell out the way dogs do. You like Peter, Paul and Mary? Yes, I do. I'm a big fan. <i>Puff the magic dragon\NDragon</i> <i>Lived by the sea</i> - Great song.\N- Yeah, one of my favorites. Who would've thought it wasn't really\Nabout a dragon, huh? What do you mean? You know,\Nthe whole drug thing. No, I don't know.\NWhy don't you tell me? Some people think that... to "puff the magic dragon"\Nmeans to-- They're really, uh-- to smoke-- to smoke-- a marijuana cigarette. Well, Puff's just the name\Nof the boy's magical dragon. Right. - Are you a pothead, Focker?\N- No! No. What?\NNo, no, no, no, Jack.\NNo, I'm-- I'm not-- I-- I pass on grass all the time. - I mean, not all the time.\N- Yes or no? No. Yes. No. Hey, Greg, I'll meet you back out front\Nin about... 12 to 15 minutes. Hey.\NHow you doing? Do you have any of those\Nnicotine patches? No. We have the gum. - Great.\N- You chew it. Thank you. Yes, okay.\NAnd what's your most expensive\Nbottle of champagne? Mumm's.\NIt's on sale for 13.95. Really? That's it?\NYou don't have, like, a nice, like, 80 or $100 bottle\Nof something? You can get\Na whole bunch of Mumm's. - Focker.\N- Hey, Jack. Ready to go? I've been ready, yeah.\NThey ran out of Collins mix. - You been waiting here long?\N- No, I was just reading up about... ...pumps.\N- Pumps? Yes. Breast pumps. I grew up on a farm. Get your hot buns,\Nhot patooties. Wow, Dina,\Neverything looks fabulous. It's such a treat for me to have\Na home-cooked meal like this. Dinner at my house usually\Nconsisted of everybody in the kitchen... fighting over containers\Nof Chinese food. You poor thing. What, there wasn't\Nenough food to go around? No, there was.\NWe just never really sat down\Nlike a family like this. Greg, would you like\Nto say grace? Oh, uh, well,\NGreg's Jewish, Dad. You know that. You're telling me Jews don't pray, honey?\NUnless you have some objection. No, no, no, no,\NI'd love to. Pam, come on,\Nit's not like I'm a rabbi or something. I said grace\Nat many a dinner table. Oh dear God, thank You. You are such a good God to us,\Na kind and gentle... and accommodating God. And we thank You, Osweet, sweet Lord of hosts... for the... smorgasbord... You have so aptly lain\Nat our table this day... and each day... by day. Day by day by day. Oh dear Lord, three things we pray. To love Thee more dearly, to see Thee more clearly, to follow Thee\Nmore nearly... day by day...\Nby day. Amen. Oh, Greg, that was lovely. Thank you, Greg.\NThat was interesting too. Oh, that's a-- that's a lovely vase.\NThat's great. Let me guess, Jack.\NIs that one of your secret cameras too? Greg, that's an urn which holds\Nthe remains of Jack's mother. Oh, I'm sorry.\NI'm so sorry. That's all right.\NYou didn't know, Greg. - I'm--\N- That's our Gran-gran. We like to think of her\Nas watching over us as we eat. Love you, Ma.\NMiss you. Miss you every day. Oh, honey, why don't you\Nread Greg your poem? Oh, no, he doesn't want\Nto hear that. What? No!\NWhat-What-What poem? You see,\Nwhen Jack had to retire... ...for health reasons--\N- That's a bunch of malarky.\NHoney, I'm fine. The doctor thought it would be\Ntherapeutic if he... sort of expressed his emotions\Nin an artistic way. Honey, you wrote the most beautiful poem\Nabout your mother. Please, we really\Nwanna hear it. - Poem, poem.\N- Please! Oh, all right.\NIt's a work in progress. I'm still not happy with it. As soon as it's ready, then I am going to glaze it\Nonto a plate... ...and put it next to the urn.\N- Nice. It's very special. "My Mother"\Nby Jack Byrnes. "You gave me life,\Nyou gave me milk, 'you gave me courage. "Your name was Angela,\Nthe angel from heaven, "but you were also an angel of God,\Nand He needed you too. "Selfishly I tried\Nto keep you here... "while the cancer\Nate away your organs... "like an unstoppable\Nrebel force. "But I couldn't save you,\Nand I shall see your face... "nevermore, nevermore, "nevermore, until we meet...\Nin heaven." Daddy, that's beautiful. It always gets me.\NAmazing. So-So-- So much love, yet also\Nso much information. It takes a lot out of him. - Greg, would you like some yams?\N- Thank you. Oh, yeah. You must've had vegetables fresher\Nthan that, growing up on a farm, Greg. Dad, Greg grew up in Detroit. He told me he grew up on a farm. - Do they have many farms in Detroit?\N- No, Dina, no, not a lot. In fact, Jack,\NI should clarify this. I didn't actually grow up...\Non a farm per se. The house we grew up in\Nwas originally erected... in the early Dutch farm,\Ncolonial style. So that, plus we had\Na lot of pets-- - Which one did you milk then?\N- Dad! Honey, he said he pumped milk. What have you ever milked? A cat. A cat? - I milked a cat once.\NYou wanna hear a story? - Sure. My sister had a cat, and the cat birthed\Na litter of kittens. Must've been 30 of them,\Nand there was this one little runt... this little sweet little...\Nlittle-engine-that-could runt... who wanted to get up there\Nand couldn't really get access\Nto the-- to the-- to the-- to the--\Nto the teat. Teat? Dad.\NWhat have you. I went in and just simply,\Nyou know, just-- into a little saucer, then took the saucer and fed it to\NGeppetto-- that's what I named him. I had-- I had no idea\Nyou could milk a cat. Oh, yeah, you can milk\Nanything with nipples. I have nipples, Greg.\NCould you milk me? Okay, could we change\Nthe subject perhaps? - Champagne, champagne.\N- Yes. - I thought maybe we could\Ncelebrate with a little bubbly.\N- That'd be great. Good idea.\NYum! "I have nipples.\NCan you milk me?" Well, in a funny way,\Nyou've already seen Deb's ring. That's true. Would anybody care for a bottle\Nof Oyster Bay Drug and Sundries\Nfinest champagne? That is so sweet of you, Greg.\NIsn't that a nice gesture? - That's very nice.\N- How could I have seen Debbie's ring, Mom? Well, when I gave Bob\Nthe okay to propose to Deb, I put him in touch\Nwith my diamond guy, and he picked out the same design\NKevin gave you. - Kevin, your old boyfriend?\N- Thanks, Dad. Well, yeah,\NKevin was Pam's fiance. Oh, my God. - Oh!\N-Jinxy, no! Greg, sweetie,\Nhow you doing? Oh, just fine, considering I desecrated\Nyour grandma's remains, found out you were engaged\Nand had your father ask me to milk him. At least back then he was\Nstill talking to me. - I can't believe you didn't\Ntell me you were that close.\N- Who, Daddy and me? No, Kevin and you. Do we have to know everything\Nabout each other's pasts? You never told me about\Nyour cat-milking days in Motown. That was\Na long time ago, Pam. Yeah, okay, well,\Nso was this. Kevin's and my connection\Nwas more physical than anything else. Physical? Like what?\NLike you worked out together? No, no, it was nothing, nothing.\NIt was a stupid sexual thing. I'm gonna go throw up now. Greg, listen. Kevin and I were only engaged\Nfor a month before I realized\Nthat I'd made a mistake, okay? I gave back the ring,\NI moved to Chicago, and I met and fell in love with you, okay,\Nso can we please drop this? - Good. - I just feel like this\Nis not going well at all. - I feel like your dad hates me.\N- He doesn't hate you, sweetie. Come on. Just give him\Na chance, all right? Maybe he's nervous too, huh? I thought he would love my gift,\Nyou know, being this big flower guy, but it's like he didn't\Neven show the slightest bit of interest. Listen to me.\NForget the gift. You are the most adorable,\Nloving, sweetest man in the whole world, and I love you. And very soon my parents\Nare gonna see that... and grow to love you too, okay? Speaking of growing\Nto love you-- - Honey, it's late.\N- I know it's late. But Mr. Winky is still\Non Chicago time, and we both know there's only one way\Nto make Mr. Winky go away. And there it is. What's with the robe? It's Pam's. My pajamas are in the suitcase\Nwith everything else. - Hey, I'll lend you a pair of Jack's.\NOkay, honey? - Sure. - You don't have to do that,\N- Oh, no, no, no. No, that's fine.\NWe have to. - Thank you.\N- You're welcome. Look, Greg, I just wanna say, don't worry\Nabout what happened tonight. Oh, thanks, Jack.\NStill, I feel horrible. I mean-- Well, it was\Na horrible thing. But let's just put all that behind us\Nand enjoy our weekend together. Okay. Okay.\NThank you, Daddy. - Oh, thank you.\N- Thanks, Mom. - These'll do just fine.\N- Good night. Night-night. Good night, sweetie.\NSee you in the morning. - Have a nice sleep.\N- Okay, you too. Oh, no, no, no, Greg, we made up\Nthe pullout for you down in the den. Oh, okay, 'cause Pam said\NI should sleep in Debbie's room. Well, Debbie'll be\Nsleeping here tomorrow. This way, you'll have more privacy,\Nyou'll have your own bathroom. Just try not to flush the toilet.\NIt's always a little quirky. - Okay.\N- Oh, one more thing. I'm a realist. I understand it's\Nthe 21st century, and you've probably had\Npremarital relations with my daughter. But under our roof, it's my way\Nor the Long Island Expressway. - Is that understood?\N- Of course, yeah. Good. Keep your snake\Nin its cage for 72 hours. Okay.

Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.\NJack, you know we've been\Nthrough this... with every boyfriend Pam has had\Nsince, what, middle school. I think Greg--\Nhe's a lovely young man. And, honey, Pam thinks\Nhe might be the one. She said that?\NShe said those exact words? I didn't tape record it, Jack,\Nbut that's the impression. What kind of a family doesn't have time\Nto sit down for dinner? - Fugitives.\N- Please try to enjoy the weekend, honey. - Both our daughters are in love.\N- That's what I'm worried about. - Oh, geez, I just realized something.\N- What? Pam's middle name.\NMartha. Pamela Martha Focker. "Operation Ko Samui"? Looking for something,\NGreg? Jesus, Jack, you scared me. I heard a noise, so I came down\Nto see if everything was okay. Everything's fine. I just-- I'm sorry.\NI saw a light on, and I kinda stumbled in. - I didn't realize--\N- That's okay. See anything interesting? No, not at all.\NI mean, I mean-- I mean, this is great, though.\NI love this-- what you-- it's a cozy little nook. I noticed you were looking\Nat that when I came in. - Yeah. - It's an antique\Npolygraph machine. Is that what that is?\NI've seen these before, but I never saw one\Nactually up close. You know what?\NWhy don't you try that on? Oh, that's okay. Oh, come on. We'll have some fun.\NI'll show you how it works. I shouldn't. - Why should you be afraid?\NYou have nothing to hide. - No, I know. - I know you know, so there\Nshouldn't be any problem.\N- No, there's no problem. - So, try it on.\N- Okay. I'll help you. Don't worry.\NYou'll enjoy this. All right. Looks complicated.\NNow these aren't 100% accurate, right? - They're--\NYou'd be surprised how accurate they are. They can tell fairly easily\Nif someone's lying or not. Now I'm gonna ask you\Nsome questions, and all you have to do\Nis answer "yes" or "no." - Okay.\N- All right. Let's give it a whirl. Did you fly on an airplane today? - Yes, I did.\N- No peeking. - Did we eat pot roast\Nfor dinner tonight? - Yes. Was it under-cooked? No, it was rare. It was a little rare\Nfor my taste. - But I wouldn't--\N- I'm just kidding, I'm just-- Relax. Relax.\NThe needles are jumping. Have you ever watched\Npornographic videos? - I mean, well, I don't--\N- Yes or no? What's the matter?\NYou can't sleep? No, no, I'm just going over some\Nof my answers from the polygraph\Ntest your dad gave me. - Oh, no, he didn't.\N- Yeah, he did. Well, did you lie to him? No! I mean--\NWell, he asked me if\Nwe were living together, and--\NWhat'd you tell him? Nothing.\NYour mother walked in... and yanked the little thingies\Noff before I had to answer. Is this how you'd react\Nif I told you he shoved bamboo\Nshoots up my fingernails? Or does he hook all your boyfriends up\Nto his little machine? Well, he doesn't need a machine.\NHe's a human lie detector. - What? - Greg, my father was never\Nin the rare flower business. That was just his cover. He was in the C.I.A.\Nfor 34 years. How could you not tell me this? I wanted to, honey,\Nbut it was strictly... on a need-to-know basis. So, what? He's in the C.I.A.?\NHe was a spy? He is a spy? No, he was more like\Na psychological profiler. They used him to interrogate\Nsuspected double agents in the company. Oh, that's great.\NYeah. I was scared of your dad\Nback when I thought he was a florist. It's wonderful to know that I've actually got\Na C.I.A. spy-hunter on my ass. Would you stop?\NYou're doing great, okay? This is a lot to take in, honey.\NI'm sorry. - It's just weird.\N- Oh, I know, but you're doing fine. I promise. - Mm, no, no!\N- W-What's wrong, sweetie? I forgot. I'm not supposed to let\Nthe snake out of my cage. Your what? I told your dad I wouldn't touch you\Nfor 72 hours. Okay, I'm not in junior high\Nanymore, so-- No, no, no. Seriously. I want to try\Nto respect his rules, okay? Okay. Fine. Uh, why don't you go ahead\Nand get some sleep,\Nand I'll see you in the morning. - Morning, Greg.\N- Good morning. Pam told me she let you in\Non a little secret of mine last night. Yes, she did. Well, as long as you can keep your\Nmouth shut for the rest of your life, you're in no immediate danger. I won't tell. I'm just being humorous. Huh. That was funny. But the fact is, Greg, with the knowledge\Nyou've been given, you are now on the inside\Nof what I like to call... "the Byrnes family\Ncircle of trust." I keep nothing from you,\Nyou keep nothing from me... and round and round we go. Okay.\NUnderstood. Okay, good. Come on. Let's go inside\Nand have breakfast. Jinxy cat, Jinxy cat\Nwhere are you I love you Jinxy. Jinxy. Not at the table,\Nhoney, please. - Attaboy!\N- Hey, hey, look who's up! - Hi, sweetie.\N- You must be Greg. - Hello. - Oh, look, somebody had a visit\Nfrom the hair fairy. - Oh, yes.\N- Nice 'do, nice 'do. I'll do the intros.\NGreg, this is my sister, Debbie. - Hi. - Nice to meet you.\NOh, the bride to be. - Congratulations.\N- And her fiancée, Dr. Bob. You can call me\NBob... M.D. - These are his parents, Linda Banks,\N- Hi. How are you? - Nice to meet you.\N...and the world-famous plastic surgeon... Dr. Larry. Whoa, now, cut that out. You know, Greg's\Nin medicine, too, Larry. - Oh, really? What field?\N- Nursing. That's good. No, really.\NWhat field? Nursing. Hey, why don't I get you\Na chair, Greg? Thank you.\NThanks. So, you didn't want\Nto go for the M.D.? No, I actually thought\Nabout becoming a doctor,\Nbut I decided it wasn't for me. Just as well.\NBoards are killer. Actually Greg aced\Nhis MCATs. - You serious?\N- No, I did okay. Oh, he did more than okay.\NTrust me. Why did you take the test\Nif you weren't planning\Non going to med school? Well, I wanted to keep\Nmy options open, but in the end,\Nnursing was a better fit for me. It gives you the freedom to work\Nin several different areas of medicine. Plus, I can focus\N100% on patient care, as opposed to being a doctor where\Nyou have to deal with the bureaucracy. - Wasn't your friend Andy\Nsupposed to be here by now?\N- Oh, my God! I thought Deb told you.\NDr. Andy threw out his back.\NHe can't make the wedding. Oh, damn. Now I have to reconfigure\Nthe whole procession. Bob, why doesn't Greg\Nstand in for Andy, be the usher? - Oh! No, Pam, no. - That'll be fine.\NBob, Greg'll be your second usher. - Good. - Uh, yeah.\NYeah, yeah, okay, sure. Good. Let's all finish up\Nand get ready to go... ...because we have a pre-activity\Nbriefing in about 32 minutes.\N- Thirty-two minutes! You know what? In that case,\NI'd better get upstairs... and pay a little visit\Nto the shower fairy. Dina, thank you so much\Nfor breakfast. Hey, you okay?\NWhy didn't you wake me up? - Because I thought you'd like to sleep late.\N- Not when I'm a guest. - It's okay. Don't worry about it.\N- No, it's not okay. Tell that to Dr. Torquemada in there\Nwith the Grand Inquisition. Go take a shower, get dressed\Nand come back down. - Get dressed in what?\N- Borrow some more of Dad's clothes. - No, I don't-- Come on.\N- Why not, honey? I just-- No, I don't feel comfortable\Nwearing your dad's underwear. Okay, well, go wake up Denny\Nand borrow some of his. You want me to go wake up\Nyour brother who I never met... and ask if I could have\Nsome of his clothes? Okay, all right. Where's Denny's room?\NTop of the stairs, turn right. Hello?\NHello? What the hell you doing in here? I'm-- I'm Greg,\NPam's friend. What? Were you just\Nsniffing my boxers, dude? No, dude, no. No, no, she said\NI could come up here, ...maybe borrow some clothes from you.\N- Do me a favor. Close the door. - Okay.\N- Quick. - Tell anybody I wasn't here?\N- No, they think you're asleep. - Yeah, so, it's all good.\N- You scared me. Dad keeps you guys under\Na pretty close watch, huh? No, it's not that bad. Your little Pamcake's\Ngot it a lot worse than I do. - Oh! You need some clothes.\N- Yes, that would be-- that would be great. - Glad to hook you up.\N- Cool. - All right? Like what you done\Nwith the crib. Oh, Lil' Kim. She's phat. P-H phat. Yeah, I think these ought a do it.\NAll right, here you go, chief. - All right!\N- Enjoy! - Thanks a lot, Denny.\N- No problem. Oh, and don't worry\Nabout the little covert op, all right? - I'll keep it on the lowdown.\N- Down low. No doubt. People, people, come get\Nyour revised itineraries. Larry, Linda,\NDebbie, Bob, honey. Now, I'm gonna activate the alarm.\NIt'll go off in T minus 16 seconds. - I don't think I need a jacket.\N- It's cold out, honey. Hold on.\NHere, take Denny's jacket. Hey, Denny, I'm lending Greg\Nyour jacket, okay? Whatever. Let's go. Denny, how's the tux fit? - Dad, uh--\N- What's that? I-It's a sculpture\NI found in Greg's jacket. This isn't a sculpture, Denny.\NThis is a device for smoking marijuana. Really? Not mine.\NIt's not. Oh, hey, Jack.\NHow you doing? I like the top hat.\NComplements you. Can I talk to you\Nfor a minute? Sit down. Did I not clearly explain\Nthe circle of trust to you, Greg? Mm, yeah, I think I got it. Then is there something\Nyou wanna tell me? I don't think so. Didn't we have a discussion yesterday\Nin the car about this? Oh, yes!\NYou mean-- Yes! You mean me and Pam.\NYes, I would love to talk to you about that. We're not talking about Pam.\NWe're talking about you. See, if I can't trust you,\NGreg, then I have no choice... but to put you right back\Noutside the circle. And once you're out, you're out.\NThere's no coming back. Mm, well, I would definitely like\Nto stay inside the circle. Well, then, tell me the truth. Jack, I don't know\Nwhat we're talking about. All right, now look, Focker,\NI'm a patient man. That's what 19 months in a\NVietnamese prison camp will do to you. But I will be watching you,\Nstudying your every move. And if I find that you are trying\Nto corrupt my firstborn child, I will bring you down, baby. I will bring you down\Nto Chinatown. Where are we? I thought\Nwe were going to Kevin's house. We are, sweetie.\NThis is Kevin's new house. - Oh, this is a crazy house.\N- Not bad, huh, Dad? Maybe he uses marijuana for medicinal purposes.\NPeople do that nowadays. Honey, this kid has been lying to us\Nfrom the moment we met him. Hey, you. Get in some\Nquality time with the boys? Uh-huh, yeah, it was fun. Listen, I hope this lunch\Nisn't too weird for you. Why would "B.B.Q\Nat Best Man's" be weird? Oh, my God, Greg.\NI was sure I told you. Kevin is Bob's best man.\NThis is his place. - Kevin, your ex-fianc?\N- Welcome, everybody. I don't understand.\NHow does he know Bob? Well, they-- they went\Nto lacrosse camp together, and Kevin was the one\Nwho introduced Bob to Debbie. Lacrosse camp? I was really lucky\NI was able to salvage this wood... from an old seamen's chapel\Nin Nantucket. Kevin, the house is amazing.\NThis is where Maybe you should have\Ngotten married here. All right, the sun is out,\Nthe grill is hot and the pool is luke. If I can interest you\Nin a swim and a little B.B.Q, just follow me. All right, Kevo.\NRight on schedule. - Bring it on.\N- Wow. It must cost a fortune... Wait till you see\Nthe rest of the house. -You okay, sweetie?\N- Yeah. I'm really sorry.\NI don't know why I thought you knew. It-- It's not\Na big deal. If I can handle a weekend\Nwithout sex and cigarettes, I think I can handle an afternoon\Nwith your ex-fiancée? Okay. Thank you. Now, for the floor that you're walking on,\NI chose this Bolivian wormwood. I think it works well in here. I have the\NViking range here and the twin Sub-Z's. - Yeah, they open up right there.\N- Oh, I get it. Like hidden. - Yeah, kind of blend in.\N- Great. Are you a homeowner, Greg? No, no, I rent. So, things are going real, real well\Nfor you, aren't they, eh, Kevo? Gosh, things have been going\Nso great lately. I got in early on some\Nwireless I.P.O.s, and the stuff\Njust skyrocketed from there. What about you, Greg?\NWhat line of work are you in? - I'm in health care. - Yeah, so you know\Nwhat I'm talking about. There are a lot of Benjamins to be\Nmade now with biotech stuff. I don't have to tell you that.\NHow's your portfolio? I'd say strong... to quite strong. You gotta strike\Nwhile the iron's hot. Now's the time. - Greg's a male nurse.\N- That's right. Thank you, Jack. Well, that's great. That's great to give something\Nback like that. I'd love to\Nfind time to do volunteer work. Just the other day I saw\Nthis golden retriever that-- He had like a gimp,\Nand he couldn't really-- It made me feel terrible.\NI wish there was something I could do. Yeah, well, I get paid, but also it feels,\Nyou know, good too. So it's kind of\Nan everybody wins. What are you-- You're like\Na Wall Street trader? - An investment guy?\N- No. I mean, I'm willing\Nto be painted with that brush. Yes, that's my day job. We have time?\NWe got time, don't we, Jack? I want to show you what I'm really\Ninterested in. Come on. Let's go. Wow! It looks like\Nsomebody got an "A" in wood shop. Yeah, it's always been kind of a hobby.\NI whittled that out of beech wood. It's beautiful. - So what got you into, uh, "carpentering"?\N- Carpentry? I guess I'd have to say Jesus. He was a carpenter, and I\Njust figured if you're gonna\Nfollow in someone's footsteps, who better than Christ? Greg's Jewish. - Are you?\N- Yeah. Well, so was J.C. Wow.\NYou're in good company. Well, I'm gonna head\Nto the pool, but why don't you show Greg and Pam\Nthe gift? - Wow, he made a gift.\N-Greg. I put a fresh coat\Nof lacquer on this this morning, so bear with me\Nwith the fumes. - Isn't that something?\N- That's incredible. - Thank you.\N- Roses. Deb's favorite. - Yes, right. - It's beautiful.\NThe little holes are for candles. Exactly. And then later,\Nthey'll collect rainfall. - They make a tiny birdbath.\N- That's great. It's beautiful.\NWhat is it? It's an altar. Or you might call it a "ho-puh". Isn't that sweet? I'm gonna take it over\Nto the Byrneses', and tomorrow Robert and Debra\Nwill meet beneath it to become man and wife. And later,\Nwhen they purchase a home, maybe it will\Ngrace their garden. Well, that's my sappy,\Nromantic idea. Must have taken forever to build. No, not too bad.\NAbout 70 hours. Which isn't bad, considering I carved it all\Nby hand from one piece of wood. Hey, Kevo. 12:15. Time to start\Nthe barbecue, big guy. Okay, Mr. B.\NI better get back to playing host. Okay, you guys,\Ngrab your suits, and I'll\Nmeet you down at the pool. - I think I'm gonna take\Na pass on the swimming.\N- Oh, no, you can't. I don't even have a suit with me.\NThe airline lost my bag and-- - Pamcake, let's go. Mom's got your suit here.\N- Coming, Dad. You better get going. Gosh, she's great.\NCongratulations, man. Thank you. And, by the way, she just\Nhad the nicest things to say about you. - Really?\N- Yeah. Gosh. Yeah, we had\Nsome good times together. Boy, she is a tomcat. So, let me hook you up\Nwith some trunks, Gregger. - I'm not gonna swim.\N- No, come on. I'm not taking no for an answer. Cold buffet is on the left,\Nwine and champagne on the right. Comin' through here. Yeah, that'd be gre-- Hey, there he is!\NGet out here. G-Man, we got salmon, we got swordfish.\NWhat's it gonna be? Ah-- How 'bout a little of both, K-Dog?\NI'm pretty hungry. I think they call that\N"the munchies." Let's go. Hit the ball, Kev!\NShow 'em what you got! Come on, team.\NHe's got nothing. - Service.\N- Come on, Greg. Nice serve, pal. Oh, Greg! Come on! - Whoo! Nice shot, Maverick!\N- Sweet setup, Iceman. - Nice one, Nurse.\N- Glenn, Glenn, Glenn. You gotta rush the net on defense.\NDon't be afraid of the ball. - It's Greg.\N- Huddle up, team. Greg, not Glenn.\NGreg is afraid of the ball. - Come on. This is unacceptable.\N- He's gotta go for the ball. - Here's what we gotta do.\N- Let's go! We're gettin' cold in here. - We're gettin' creamed.\N- If Florence Nightingale\Nover here would play defense. - Larry, I missed one shot.\N- It was a big shot. Larry, keep floatin' where\Nyou are. You're doin' great. Denny, take the deep shots.\NGreg, nobody's expecting\Nmuch out of you. - If I set you up with the ball,\Ncan you jump up and spike it? - No. Yeah. I'd have to be\Npretty high, but yeah. I bet you would, Panama Red. - All right, everybody, look sharp. Break!\N- Let's play some ball. All right, here we go. Let's go.\NCome on. Greg!\NSet! You gotta spike those, Focker!\NYou gotta spike those! - Look how Bob did that. Nice play, Bob.\N- Thanks, Jack. Fire it up there, Focker!\NLet's do it! - Way to go, Deb!\N- Greg! Honey! God! - What the hell's the matter with you?\N- It's only a game, Focker! Oh, honey! I'm coming! Get some ice. - My eye! Oh, my eye!\N- Focker! Pam, help your sister, please.\NI'm sorry, Deb. Deb, you can totally see Voit\Nbackwards on your forehead. - Denny, get outta here!\N- You the bandleader? - Yes, sir. Go over the song selection\Nwith Bob. Bob? Bob! - Yeah, Jack.\N- Are you a Mr. Focker? - Yes.\N- Okay. Sign here, please. Hey, your suitcase.\NYou go through it, make sure it's all there? - Yeah, it's fine. - Good.\N- What's up? I just wanna make sure you're okay\Nsince hitting the spike heard 'round the world. - Oh, yeah. I'm really sorry about that.\N- It's okay. I don't know\Nwhat got into me, Iceman. - "Iceman"? - I'm sorry. Is that a\Nspecial thing between you and Kev... - Stop it.\N- Stop what, Iceman? Top Gun was a very popular movie\Nwhen Kevin and I dated. - All right? That's it.\N- Hey, Iceman. Do you want to be Maverick?\NIs that what this is all about? - I can't be Maverick. Kevin's Maverick.\N- He used to be, but we can change that. - Um, can he be Goose?\N- No, because Goose dies in the end. Very sad. - Honey, I don't really--\N- Greg, shut up. - Jesus, Dad, you ever think of knocking?\N- Not in my own den. - What are you two doing in here?\N- I'd say rounding in 2nd base. - This is Greg's room, Dad.\N- Not anymore. We're gonna\Nuse it for storage. Greg will stay\Nin Debbie's room, and she'll\Nbunk up with you tonight. Fine.\NCome on, Greg. - Okay. I'll be right up.\N- I'll meet you upstairs. Oh, good.\NThey found your suitcase. Hey, Jack, I don't quite know\Nwhat happened back at the tux shop, but if I've given you\Nthe wrong impression regarding\NPam in any way, I'm sorry. Okay? I have nothing but the best\Nintentions with Pam, and I-I just-- Actually, there's something\Nin the suitcase here that\NI'm planning on giving her... that I think, um,\Nsymbolizes... the level\Nof my commitment, uh, to her. And I wouldn't feel right\Nasking her to wear it... without her father's permission. Jack? Did you flush\Nthis toilet? Maybe. You know what?\NMaybe Jinx flushed it. I saw little Jinxy\Ncome in last night, and he took a little squat\Nand relieved himself. Jinx knows not to use that toilet,\Nand even if he did, he'd never flush it. - What does it matter?\N- The matter, Greg, R.N., is that when this toilet\Nis flushed, it runs, and when you have a septic tank\Nthat's nearly full and a toilet\Nthat's been running all night, then you could have\Na hell of a problem. Mr. Byrnes? This is not part\Nof my job description. Nice stench.\NYou're really on a roll there, bud. Bite me, Denny! In 20 hours, I'm having a wedding here,\Nso I need my cesspool pumped now! - Not tomorrow. Now!\N- Dad, what's going on? - Oh, my God!\N- What's that smell? That smell, Bob,\Nis our shit. Focker flushed the toilet in the den,\Nso the septic tank is overflowing. Jack, I told you.\NIt wasn't me. It was Jinx. Focker, I'm not gonna tell you again! Jinx cannot flush the toilet.\NHe's a cat, for Christ sakes! The animal doesn't\Neven have thumbs, Focker. - Hey, look at this!\N- Kevo! Over by the tree, right? No. No, no, no.\NNot on the lawn! Stay where you are.\NNot on the lawn! What the heck? <i>I got my mojo workin'</i> <i>Just won't work on you</i> <i>I got my mojo workin'</i> <i>Just won't work on you</i> I know that's what I said I wanted,\N'cause that's what I wanted. It is a black\NSamsonite suitcase. What I'm saying is, do you\Nthink it's possible that\Nthe Samsonite people, in some crazy little scheme\Nto actually turn a profit,\Nmade more than one? - I don't think so.\N- You don't? - I am going to need your\Nbaggage claim number again.\N- Jinx, stop. - I know I signed for it.\N- I'm looking at your signature\Nright here, Mr. Focker. - Do me a favor. Could I talk\Nto your supervisor? - Excuse me? - What's your name?\N- Joy. - Okay, let me talk to your supervisor.\N- My supervisor is on a break. When he gets back, have him give me\Na call right away. - It's a very important bag.\N- I'm sure it is-- - Don't ask me what it's for.\NI need you to do this thing. Please, I'm in a time situation here,\Nso just do it. I'll hold on. - So the name's "Greg Focker"?\N- I don't know. Greg or Gregory.\NRun both names. Jinx. Come on. No. Jinx.\NCome here. Jinxy. Jinx. Oh, shit. Greg didn't ace his med\Nschool boards. He never\Neven took the goddamn MCATs. Oh, Jack, that's what you\Nhad your sources check out? What this poor boy did\Non some test scores? I bet he doesn't even have\Na real nursing degree. A lot of these hospital workers\Nare just pill poppers looking\Nfor easy access to ludes. We already know that he's been\Npuffin' the magic dragon. I knew the little crack\Nwas lying. Jinxy. Come here.\NCome here, little Jinxy. Jinxy cat, Jinxy cat\NI won't hurt you. The fact is,\NGreg lied to you. - He did not lie to me, Dad.\N- He lied to you when I thought\Nyou should know the truth. I love you too much\Nto see you get hurt. I don't care what your information says, Dad.\NGreg took the MCATs. Okay? No! Oh!\NOh, my God! All right, everybody.\NAll right, stand back. Stay back. Stay back. Oh, Jack! Oh, God! We've got a fire! Somebody call 911\Nright away! Hurry up! Jinxy! Jinxy! We checked every yard,\Nevery car on the street.\NNobody's seen him. He's not up in any\Nof the trees, Jack. We checked all the bedrooms.\NJinx isn't up here. Yeah, none of the neighbors\Nhave seen him either. You tried to milk him, didn't you,\Nyou sick son of a bitch! Dad, stop it.\NThat's enough. Honey, please calm down.\NHow can I calm down... if we're 15 minutes away\Nfrom the wedding rehearsal\Nand the ring bearer's missing? - Whoa. What do you mean, "the ring bearer"?\N- Your daddy didn't tell you? He taught Jinx to walk down the aisle\Nwith this little pillow. Oh, no.\NNo, you didn't, Dad. Yeah, yeah. You put this around\Nthe neck, and these ribbons are for the rings. That's adorable, Jack.\NOh, for Chris sakes! - That's great, Dad.\N- Yeah, but now we have\Nto postpone the rehearsal. Bob, you ride with me.\NLarry, you come with your car. We're gonna canvass the neighborhood.\NDee, ask O'Boyle to wait. If we're not back in an hour, we'll\Nreschedule the rehearsal for the morning. - Jack! - No! We cannot cancel the\Nrehearsal for some stupid cat! Stupid cat? How could you say that?\NThat cat's been like a brother to you! We're supposed to let him wander\Nthe streets without food, water or toilet? - D-Dad, Greg'll find him.\N- What? - Yeah, what?\N- Oh, that's wonderful. Fine. Fine. Okay.\NDenny? - Denny? Denny? Denny!\N- Dad, I'm right here. Okay. You're gonna fill in\Nas the ring bearer for now. - No. I'm not wearin' that\Nstupid pillow thing on my head.\N- Oh, yes, you damn well will! Jinx! Jinx!\NHere, Jinx. You just go and wander the streets\Nwithout food, water or toilet? Fucker! Actually, you may be in luck.\NThey brought in a Himalayan a little while ago. There he is. Holyshit, that's Jinx. - Jinxy!\N- Uh, no, let me see that photo again. You gotta picture him without\Nthat stupid Santa cap. - Come on, Jinxy. Jinxy!\N- Uh, no. You see, in the picture,\Nyour cat has an all-black tail. And this one has a white tip. No, I'm sorry\Nabout that, chief. - Looks just like him.\N- Almost. Except for that tail. Dearly beloved-- we are gathered here\Non this beautiful day... to join Dr. Robert Banks-- Dearly beloved, we are gathered here\Non this beautiful day... to join Dr. Robert Banks\Nand Debra Byrnes in holy matrimony. This is a special day-- He found him!\NYea! It's him!\NIt's him! I gotta see this. - Look, Dad, it's Jinx.\N- Oh, my little baby! - We found you. We found you.\N- Greg, thank you so much. - Where did you find him?\N- Gave us a little scare, huh? <i>For once in my life\NI got someone who needs me</i> To Greg.\NHooray! - Honey, where is Greg, anyway?\N- He's in the restroom. Yes, I tried there. I've tried every shelter\Non the north shore, okay? He's a brown-and-black Himalayan\Nwith an all-black tail. Mr. Jinx. Yeah, okay.\NYou go check. I'll call you back. It's the man of the hour. Sorry, folks. Had to pay a little visit\Nto the urinal fairy. Greg, nice work\Nwith the cat today. Aw, thanks, Jack.\NI'm just glad I could help out. We never did get to finish\Nthat little "convo" back at the den. So, when you have a minute, there is\Nstill something I'd like to talk to you about. We'll get right to it as soon as\Nwe get back. You have my word. I'm gonna hold you to that.\NCircle of trust. Guess who's back in\Nthe circle of trust. <i>Pull the string\Nand I'll wink at you</i> <i>I'm your puppet</i> Oh, poor Kevin looks lonely. Maybe I should ask him to dance.\NWhat do you think? Sure. I bet he could, uh, whittle a\Nprivate little dance floor for the two of you. I'm serious. I saw some beech wood outside.\NHe's very handy. He's an extremely handy\Nand crafty craftsman. I shouldn't paint him\Nwith that brush, but-- Come on. Seriously. Seriously.\NPart of you wishes you ended up with him. Yes, he's very talented, but it would've\Nnever worked out. Why not? I was never in love with Kevin. I'm in love with you. - That's a good explanation.\N- Think so? Thought you'd like that. - I do.\N- I'm glad. No, Jinx. Mr. Jinx.\NI called you like half an hour ago. Okay, I already--\NI already described it. Airline. Messages. It's brown... with a little bit\Nof black trim. Yes. <i>Please enter\Nyour four-digit code.</i> <i>Jack, hi.\NIt's Hank MacAtee from next door.</i> <i>You'll never guess who wandered\Nover here this afternoon. Mr. Jinx.</i> <i>Yeah, he's not wearing his collar,\Nbut, uh, I'm sure it's Jinxy.</i> <i>Thought you might be worried, so just\Ngive me a jingle when you guys get home,</i> <i>and I'll bring\Nthe little rascal over.</i> Okay, well, if you could just keep checking,\Nplease, and I'll call you back later. Thanks. Any luck? No, they're still looking. Hey, Jack,\Nthis is a great party. I guess sometimes these things sort\Nof come together in their own kooky sort of way. Yeah, it's kind of like\Nthe way you found Jinxy. - You found him at that animal shelter, huh?\N- Uh-huh. Yeah, right. - Well, the important thing\Nis he's home now. - Yes. Yeah. You know, there's something about\Nthat ball of fur... that just puts\Na big smile on my face. Yeah. You haven't seen any of\Nhis latest tricks, have you? Well, when we get back,\NI'll show you. We don't have to do it tonight.\NHe's had a long day. He's probably tired. No, I think he'd like\Nto show you tonight. Why don't you give me\Nthe key and let me drive? Hey, Larry. You know what?\NWhy don't I drive? Be my guest, Focker. - Hey, sweetie, what are you doing?\N- Larry said I could drive. - Let's go. Hurry, hurry.\N- All right. Bye, guys. - See you.\N- Thanks for driving. Drives a little better\Nthan your Taurus, huh, Greg? Come on. Get in the car, honey.\NLet's go. Hurry up. Whoa, Nellie! Everybody comfortable\Nback there? You're a real wild man\Nat that wheel there. You got your seat belts on back there?\NGet your seat belts on. Oh, Jesus, Focker! Focker, take it easy. Benz drives like a dream, Larry. Oh, there's Jack. Hey, Jackie. Wanna play, Pops?\NLet's play. Okay, now, Greg? Greg? Is everything okay, honey? Yeah, just trying\Nto make good time. What the heck\Nis the matter with you? All right. We're gonna be home.\NWe're gonna get home. It's not the autobahn.\NCome on, Greg! - Maybe you should drive after all, honey.\N- We're okay. All right. Oh, no.\NNo, please. - Yes!\N- Jack just turned. You were supposed\Nto make that left at the light, Focker. I think I'm gonna be sick. Where does he think he's going? - Home, home, home.\N- What a fun ride. Who gave him the keys? - Okay, we're out.\N- Yeah, we've had enough excitement. I wonder if he has a license. Yeah, a license to kill. Come on, everybody. Hey, nice driving, Mario! You're a lunatic! Come on, Linda! It was the cat!\NGoddamn you! Dad, Dad-- Dad! Dad! Calm down! - Where's the cat?\N- Cat got out! Cat got out, Jack! You spray-painted his tail... to make him look like Jinxy,\Ndidn't you, Focker? Greg, what's he talking about? Hank MacAtee called me a couple of\Nhours ago and told me he found Jinxy. He took his collar\Nand put it on an impostor. Then he spray-painted his tail,\Nand then he tried to beat us back here... so that he could\Nget rid of the evidence. Please tell me\Nthat's not true, Greg. It was just a temporary solution\Nuntil I could find the real Jinx. How could you do\Nsomething like that? - I'm sorry.\N- What are you going to tell me next? That you set Kevin's\Naltar on fire? Oh, my God. Well, it wasn't intentional.\NI was chasing Jinx up onto the roof. I had a smoke, and I think\NI might have lit something that-- I don't know what happened. He put so\Nmuch goddamn lacquer on that thing. It was an accident\Nwaiting to happen. This is very disappointing, Greg. Get out of my house, Focker,\Nand take your friend with you. So you lied to me\Nabout everything, huh, Greg? You lied about the cat,\Nabout the fire, about the MCATs. I didn't lie about the MCATs. Come on, Pam.\NDon't you see what's happening here? - Your dad has totally turned you against me.\N- I didn't turn her against you. You did that to yourself. Jack, please. You didn't like me from\Nthe second I walked in here. I'm a very\Naccepting person, Focker. All I ask for is honesty. Oh, honesty? You wanna talk about\Ntruth and honesty, Jack? Okay, let's talk\Na little truth and honesty. Let's talk a little\N"Operation Ko Samui," Jack. What's he talking about, Dad? Yeah, that's weird, 'cause I thought there\Nweren't any secrets... inside the circle of trust, Jack. - I don't know what you're talking about.\N- You don't? Huh? What's the matter?\NCat got your tongue? Hey, Pam, guess what. Daddy's planning a little\Ncovert operation in Thailand\Nfor the day after the wedding. You are? Round and round we go, Jack. Hey. I bet everybody would love\Nto hear about your rendezvous... in the parking lot of the Oyster Bay\NDrug and Sundry. You know what I'm talking about.\NWhere the guy gave you\Nthe passports and the documents. Or how about\Nyour little phone call in Thai? - Jack can't talk Thai.\N- Oh, no, Dina. Jack can talk Thai.\NJack talk Thai very well. I'm sorry, Pam,\Nbut your dad is not retired. He's still very much\Nin the C.I.A. - Daddy. What--\N- He's right. He's right.\NMy cover's blown. I-I-I am planning... a secret operation\Nthe day after the wedding. - What?\N- A surprise honeymoon for Deb and Bob. You stupid son of a bitch!\NYou just blew it! What? Ko Samui is an island\Noff the coast of Thailand! That guy I was meeting in the parking lot\Nis Thor Svenson, my travel agent. He was giving me their visas. Wow, Thailand. Thanks a lot, J.B.\NThat's something. Don't mention it.\NI just, um-- You know, if this nursing\Nthing doesn't work out, Focker, I'd say you definitely\Nhave a career in espionage. Thanks, Greg. Well, I guess I'm gonna go\Nto the airport now. I guess you're gonna stay here. Pam, I-- - Gaylord M. Focker?\N- Gaylord? Gaylord? Yeah, that's me. - I thought your name was Greg.\N- It is. That's not what it says\Non the form. I know. It's my legal name. Nobody's called me\Nby it since I was in third grade. Whatever. Wait, wait, wait, wait.\NSo your name's Gay Focker? - Denny.\N- I'm sorry. It's just it's not... You're in luck.\NThere is room. And without a Saturday stay-over,\Nthat fare difference will be... $1,137.11. - Would you want me to book you the seat?\N- Okay. All right. Did you want to check\Nany bags today? We should be all right\Nwith only one usher, don't you think? I'm not so sure, Jack. Thought you might like to see this. - How did you get this?\N- Oh, I have my sources too. I called Gaylord,\Na.k.a. Greg's parents in Detroit. They saved his SAT scores too,\Nin case you're interested. Oh, honey. It--\NThat doesn't matter if he\Ndid well on some test. What does that prove?\NLook at this place! He almost destroyed the wedding\Nbecause he lied! I love you Daddy, but you can be\Na real jerk sometimes. So what if he took the MCATs?\NHe's still not good enough for Pam. Who is, Jack? Nobody has ever been\Ngood enough for your Pam. I mean, do you realize that you\Nnever even warmed up to Kevin\Nuntil she broke up with him? Maybe it's time you think about\Nwhat Pam wants. Greg, it's me. I'm sure you're in\Nthe air by now, so I guess you'll just\Nget this when you get home. Listen, I am so sorry. I acted like a complete idiot, and I hope that you\Ncan forgive me. I mean, I-I don't care about\Nthe fire or the cat or-- I mean, I can't believe you\Nactually spray-painted a cat. That's actually really gross,\Nbut th-the point is that-- that I understand\Nwhy you did it, and-- and I love you. I want you to know that I really--\NI really, really love you, and, uh-- When you get this,\Nwill you please call me? Okay. Bye. Marty, listen, I need\Na commercial flight I.D. scan. Interstate from New York\NLa Guardia to Chicago. Four-hour sweeps,\Nbackwards and forwards. Last name: Foxtrot, Oscar,\NCharlie, Kilo, Echo, Romeo. First name: Golf,\NAlpha, Yankee, Lima-- Gaylord Focker on Atlantic American\Nflight 27, departs 2:35. - 2:35? - Affirmative.\NTwenty-three minutes. Thanks. Enjoy your flight.\NThanks. Hello. Oh, I'm sorry. We're only boarding\Nrows nine and above right now.\NYou'll have to wait. Well, I'm in row eight. Please step aside, sir. It's just one row.\NDon't you think it's okay if I-- We'll call your row\Nmomentarily. Step aside, sir. Thank you for waiting. We'd like to\Ncontinue boarding the aircraft now. We're now boarding all rows,\Nplease. All remaining rows. Mm, hello. Enjoy your flight. Excuse me. Okay, where's the fire, huh? - I'm sorry, sir. You're gonna have\Nto check that. - I got it. - No, I'm sorry. That bag won't fit.\N- No, I'm not-- Hey. - I'm not checking my bag, okay?\N- There's no need to raise your voice, sir. I'm not raising my voice.\NThis would be raising my voice to you, okay? I don't want to check my bag. By the way,\Nyour airline, you suck at checking bags. Because I already did that once,\Nand you lost it, and then I had everything\Nscrewed up very badly for me. - Okay?\N- I can assure you that your bag... will be placed safely below deck\Nwith the other luggage. Oh, yeah? How do you know my bag\Nwill be safe below with the other luggage? Are you physically gonna\Ntake my bag beneath the plane? Are you gonna go with the guys\Nwith the earmuffs and put it in there? - No.\N- No? Okay. Then shut your pie hole... and listen to me\Nwhen I say that I am finished... with the checking-of-the-bags\Nconversation! Sir, we have a policy on this airline\Nthat if a bag is this large, we-- Get your grubby little paws\Noff of my bag, okay? It's not like I have a bomb in here.\NIt's not like I want to blow up the plane. - Sir!\N- I wanna stow my bag according\Nto your safety regulations. - Sir, sir--\N- If you would take a second... and take the little sticks out of your head\Nand clean out your ears, maybe you would see that\NI'm a person who has feelings, and all I have to do\Nis do what I wanna do! All I wanna do is hold onto my bag\Nand not listen to you! The only way that I would ever let go of\Nmy bag would be if you came over here now... and tried to pry it\Nfrom my dead, lifeless fingers. Okay? If you can get it from my kung fu\Ngrip, then you can have it. Okay? Otherwise, step off, bitch. Get off of me!\NGet off of me! - You got him?\N- Yeah. - Hey. Hey! You can't leave\Nyour vehicle unattended. - Tow it. I've got a plane full of people\Nsaying you threatened that stewardess. I was not threatening her.\NI was trying to get my bag\Ninto the overhead storage thing. You were acting like a maniac,\Nand you threatened her with a bomb! - I said I didn't have a bomb!\N- You said "bomb." - I said, "It's not like I have a bomb."\N- You said "bomb" on an airplane. - What's wrong with saying\N"bomb" on an airplane?\N- You can't say "bomb." Bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb,\Nbomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb!\NYou gonna arrest me? - You assaulted an airline employee--\N- What if I was a bombardier? - I got enough to put you away\Nfor a few years!\N- Bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb! Norm. Take five.\NWe got a specialist here. Bye, Norm. Oh, shit.\NHow'd you get here? I'm everywhere, Focker. I didn't do anything, Jack. - Yeah, I know.\N- Well, then tell these guys\Nthat I'm not a terrorist. Listen, Focker. I'm not gonna tell anybody\Nanything until you answer some questions. Unless you want to spend the next\Ncouple of years of your life in prison, you better goddamn well\Ntell me the truth. No more lies. You understand?\NNo more lies. - Did you do this?\N- Just answer the questions. - Did you have me taken off of that airplane?\N- Just answer the question. Put your hands\Nover there. That's it. You're sick, you know that? Is your name Gaylord Focker?\NYes or no? - Yes.\N- Are you a male nurse? - Yes.\N- Are you a pothead? - No.\N- Have you ever smoked pot? Yes. Did you spray-paint the tail\Nof a cat to pass him off as Mr. Jinx? Yes. Did you do that because you desperately\Nwere seeking my approval? - Yes.\N- Because you love my daughter Pam? - Yes.\N- Do you wanna marry her? Do you want to marry her? I did, until I met you. What does that mean? I love your daughter, Jack.\NI love her more than anything. But frankly, sir, I'm a little terrified\Nof being your son-in-law. This whole weekend\Nhas given me a lot of doubts... about whether or not\NI could even survive in your family. I think you've got\Nsome serious issues. If I lighten up, would you\Nconsider marrying my daughter? Would you lighten up a lot? - Yeah.\N- Yes or no? - Yes.\N- Would you let me and Pam... live our lives and not\Ninterfere all the time? I promise not interfere\Nin your lives all the time. Will you stop making fun of me\Nfor being a nurse? Could you at least try, maybe,\Nto consider another profession? - Jack, yes or no?\N- Ever? - No!\N- Okay, yes. Would you let me and Pam\Nsleep in the same room? Don't push it, Focker. You're in a real mess. If you married my daughter,\Nwould you support her... in the way that she\Ndeserves to be supported? - Yes.\N- Would you be honest and faithful to her? Yes. Will you devote yourself entirely to her\Nfor the rest of your life? Of course. Gaylord Focker, will you be my son-in-law? Greg? I thought you were\Ngoing back to Chicago? Yeah, well, we had\Na little plane trouble. Plus, your dad\Ncaught up with me at the airport. No. Don't worry. It's okay. We worked out\Na lot of our issues. You and my dad worked out\Na lot of your issues? Yeah. First he gave me his little human\Nlie detector thing, but I passed. Good. Yeah, and... then he proposed. Are you feeling all right? Listen. This weekend was a nightmare. I had this whole\Nelaborate plan, and then... somewhere between\Ngiving your sister a black eye... and setting the house on fire,\Nit kind of went off track. I just-- I love you.\NI love you so much. I think he's about to do it, Jack. Come on, honey.\NGive 'em some privacy. ...and I think\Nif we can get through... what we got through in the last 48 hours,\Nwe could get through anything. I think so too. - And, Greg, I don't--\N- Wait. Hang on a second. Mr. Jinx? That's a ring. I like to think of it\Nas a little circle of trust. Pam? - Will you marry me?\N- Yes. Yes. Yes. Attaboy, Greg! That "circle of trust" thing?\NThat's mine. Well, looks like we got\Nanother wedding to plan. - Yep. Just gotta do one more thing.\N- What's that? Meet his parents. - Jack--\N- Honey, relax. I'm sure they're wonderful, Good night, Jack. I mean, they'd have to be, right,\Nto name their son Gaylord Focker. Do you, Debra Byrnes,\Ntake Robert Banks... to be your lawfully\Nwedded husband? Yes. I mean, I do. I now pronounce you\Nman and wife. Let's just see if you really can\Nflush the toilet, Jinxy. I knew it. Shit! - I knew it.\N- Damn it! That's my future son-in-law.\NWhat do you think? Hello, Jack. Oh, look at that.\NNice Jack. Hi. What's that, Jack?\NWhat? You're a big, bad C.I.A. man, huh? Did they teach you that in the C.I.A.?\NThey teach you that? Oh, yeah.\NWhat's that, Jack? What? Yeah, you thought Puff was just\Nthe name of the boy's magical dragon? Not too quick\Non the uptake, huh, Jack? Why don't you ask Denny who's puffin'\Nthe magic dragon? Not onto that one, huh? Surprising for a big\NC.I.A. pulse detector. Ooh. Hey, hey, check my pulse\Non this question, Jack. Do I think you're a psycho?\NYes. What? Oh, you like my little gift? What?\NThe Jerusalem what? What? I can't hear you.\NJerusalem toodle-oo-poosey, poosley-loo? What? What?\NOh, you don't now shit about flowers. What's that?\NYou want me to what?
