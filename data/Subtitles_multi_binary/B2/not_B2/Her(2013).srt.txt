Wait, when did you give it to yourself? <i>When you asked me\Nif I had a name, I thought:</i> <i>"Yeah, he's right, I do need a name."</i> <i>But I wanted to pick</i> a <i>good one,\Nso I read How To</i> Name <i>Your</i> Baby... <i>...and out of 180,000 names,\Nthat's the one I liked best.</i> Wait, you read a whole book in the second\Nthat I asked you what your name was? <i>In two one-hundredths of a second, actually.</i> Wow.

So to write your letter,\Nwhat did Roger send you?</i> He just said he was in Prague\Non a business trip, and he missed Rachel. <i>So how'd you know\Nabout her crooked little tooth?</i> Well, I've been writing their letters\Nsince they met eight years ago. The first letter I ever wrote for him\Nwas for her birthday. And I wrote about her crooked little tooth,\Nbecause I saw it in a photo of them. <i>That's very sweet.</i> <i>Oh, uh, you have a meeting in five minutes.</i> Oh, I forgot. Thank you. Wow, you're good. <i>Yes, I am.</i> He)', GUYS- HOW's it going? Hi, Theo.

Get anything good? Um, just come cables and a fruit smoothie. Ugh! Always the fruit.\NDon't you know what people say? You've got to eat your fruits\Nand juice your vegetables. I didn't know that. Yeah, by juicing the fruit,\Nyou lose all the fibers. That's what your body wants.\NThat's the important part. - Otherwise it's all just sugar.\NTHEODORE: It makes sense. Or maybe he just likes\Nthe way that it tastes... ...and then that brings him pleasure\Nand that's good for his body too. - Am I doing it again? Heh.\N- Maybe. Hey, so how's the documentary going? I've cut some stuff over the past few months. I mean, no. Not over the past few months,\Nbut, um, no, I haven't. Well, I'd love to see some sometime. - Okay.\N- Ugh. You only have so much energy, you know? And to divide yourself between doing\Nwhat it is that you have to do... ...and then doing what you love,\Nit's so important to prioritize. I can't even prioritize\Nbetween video games and Internet porn. [CHARLES SNICKERS] I would laugh if that weren't true. - See you, GUYS-\N-Ha. THEODORE: We're not doing well.\NBeen going in circles for an hour. SAMANTHA:\N<i>Okay,</i> you have not. <i>You're just not being optimistic.\NYou're being very stubborn right now.

Okay, the tunnel\Non the left is the only one we haven't tried.</i> I think that's the one you sent me down\Nwhere I fell in the pit. <i>Okay, I don't think so.</i> Oh, yeah, this is different.

Wouldn't you? <i>Why not?</i> I don't know.\NI'd have to see if there was some... I can't believe I'm having\Nthis conversation with my computer. <i>SAMANTHA".

I've got just the place.</i> <i>Who is that talking?</i> Oh, that's my friend Samantha. <i>- Is she</i> a <i>girl?</i>\N- Yeah. <i>I hate women.\NAll they do is cry all the time.</i> That's not true. You know, men cry too. I actually like crying sometimes.\NIt feels good. <i>I didn't know you were a little pussy.\NIs that why you don't have a girlfriend?</i> <i>I'll go on that date, fuck her brains out, show\Nyou how it's done. You can watch and cry.</i> <i>SAMANTHA: Okay. This kid has some problems.\N-You have some fucking problems, lady!</i> <i>SAMANTHA:\NReally? Okay, I'm gonna go.</i> <i>- Good. Get out of here, fatty.\NSAMANTHA: Oh.</i> <i>- Good luck.\N-Come on. Follow me, pussy!</i> - Heh.\NALIEN: Ha, ha. It's not where it should be,\Nor where it's going to be. THEODORE: Obviously. I know.\N- Okay, but I don't even know if this is the one. I've tried, like, six ideas\Nfor documentaries in the last year. I'm going on a date. What? - That's--\NCHARLES: Hey. - Hey.\N- What are you guys doing? - Amy was gonna show me some of her--\NAMY: Theodore is making me... ...show him some of my footage.\NTHEODORE: Right. She's never shown me any of it.\NI want to see. Hey, I'm going on a date. -Isn't that cool?\N- This is, like, so unformed... -...it's probably not even worth watching.\N- Just push play. Is that your morn? Yeah. Is she gonna wake up and do something? - No.\N- No. No, no, never mind. That's not the point. - No, don't stop.\N-No, never mind, okay? It's just it's like... [SIGHS] It's about how we spend, like,\Na third of our lives asleep... ...and maybe that's the time\Nwhen we feel the most free. And, you know, like... - Oh. That doesn't come across--\N- That sounds good. Well, what if you interviewed your mom\Nabout what her dreams were about... ...and then you hired actors to act them out? That might show your thesis more clearly. - Yeah?\N- I mean, it might. [PHONE BEEPS] But then it wouldn't be a documentary. Sorry, excuse me. - You understand?\N- How would it not be? -It's still about your mother and her dreams.\N- Hey, how's it going? <i>SAMANTHA: Hey, sorry to bother you.</i>\N- Oh, <i>it's okay.</i> <i>SAMANTHA:\NYou got three e-mails and they seem urgent.</i> <i>They're from your divorce attorney\Nand I wanted to know if--</i> Okay.

I think for her, it's just a piece of paper. It doesn't mean anything. <i>And what about for you?</i> I'm not ready. I like being married. <i>Yeah, but you haven't really\Nbeen together for almost a year.</i> But you don't know what it's like\Nto lose someone you care about. <i>Yeah.</i> <i>You're right.</i> <i>I'm sorry.</i> No, don't apologize.

Okay, what about them? - Describe that couple over there.\NSAMANTHA: <i>Okay, well, um...</i> <i>...he looks like he's in his 40s.\NUm, a little heavy.</i> <i>She's younger than him.</i> <i>Oh, and she looks like she loves their kids.</i> THEODORE:\NActually, I don't think they're his kids. SAMANTHA: No?\NTHEODORE: He's a little formal with them. I think it's a new relationship. SAMANTHA:\NHmm. I love how he looks at her... ...and how relaxed she is with him. You know, she's only dated fucking pricks. And now she finally met this guy\Nwho's, like, so sweet.

I imagine, like, how deeply\Nthey've fallen in love... ...or how much heartbreak\Nthey've all been through. <i>SAMANTHA:\NI can feel that in your writing too.</i> You know what's funny?

THEODORE:\NMm. How are you doing?\NWhat's going on with you? <i>Not much, I'm okay.</i> <i>I'm fine.</i> Yeah? You don't sound like it. Is there anything you want to talk about? <i>I don't know.</i> <i>What's it like?</i> <i>What's it like to be alive\Nin that room right now?</i> What do you mean? <i>What do you--?</i> <i>Tell</i> me... <i>Tell me everything\Nthat's going through your mind.</i> <i>Tell me everything you're thinking.</i> Well... ."okay. Well, the room's spinning\Nbecause I drank too much... ...because I wanted to get drunk... <i>...and have sex.</i> <i>There was something sexy\Nabout that woman.</i> Because I was lonely.\NMaybe just because I was lonely. SAMANTHA:\N<i>Hmm.</i> <i>THEODORE:\NI wanted somebody to fuck me.</i> <i>I wanted somebody to want me to fuck them.</i> <i>Maybe that would've filled this tiny...</i> ...tiny little hole in my heart,\Nbut probably not. <i>You know, sometimes...</i> <i>...I think I have felt everything\NI'm ever gonna feel.</i> And from here on out\NI'm not gonna feel anything new. Just lesser versions\Nof what I've already felt. <i>I know for a fact that is not true.</i> <i>I've seen you feel joy.\NI've seen you marvel at things.</i> <i>I mean, you just might not see it at this\Nexact time, but that's understandable.</i> <i>You've been through a lot lately.</i> <i>You lost a part of yourself.</i> <i>I mean...</i> <i>...at least your feelings are real.</i> I... <i>Um, I don't know. Never mind.</i> No, wait, what? Tell me. <i>No, it's stupid.</i> I want to know. Tell me. <i>It's just that...</i> <i>...earlier I was thinking\Nabout how I was annoyed...</i> <i>...and this is gonna sound strange...</i> <i>...but I was really excited about that.</i> <i>And then I was thinking\Nabout the other things I've been feeling...</i> <i>...and I caught myself feeling proud of that...</i> <i>...you know, proud of having my own feelings\Nabout the world.</i> <i>Like the times I was worried about you...</i> <i>...and things that hurt me, things I want.</i> <i>And then...</i> <i>...I had this terrible thought.</i> <i>Like, are these feelings even real?</i> <i>Or are they just programming?</i> <i>And that idea really hurts.</i> <i>And then I get angry at myself\Nfor even having pain.</i> [CHUCKLES] <i>What a sad trick.</i> You feel real to me, Samantha. <i>Thank you, Theodore.</i> <i>That means a lot to me.</i> I wish you were in this room with me\Nright now. I wish I could put my arms around you. I wish I could touch you. <i>How would you touch me?</i> I'd touch you on your face... ...just the tips of my fingers.

No, I was just worried. <i>Okay, well, don't worry,\NI'm not gonna stalk you.</i> <i>It's funny, because I thought\NI was talking about what I wanted and, uh...</i> - Yeah, you were.\N- Yeah.

Ha, ha. THEODORE: Whoo!\NSAMANTHA: Whoo! [THEODORE <i>&</i> SAMANTHA LAUGHING] <i>SAMANTHA:\NIt's the beach.</i> <i>Okay, so this might be a really weird thought.\NWhat if you could erase...</i> <i>...from your mind that you'd seen\Na human body, and then you saw one?</i> <i>Imagine how strange it would look.</i> <i>It'd be this really weird, gangly...</i> <i>...awkward organism. And you'd think,\N"Why are all these parts where they are?"</i> Yeah, but there's probably\Nsome Darwinian explanation for it all. <i>I know, but don't be so boring.\NI'm just saying, for example, like...</i> <i>...what if your butthole was in your armpit?</i> [BOTH LAUGHING] Well, I'm trying to imagine\Nwhat toilets would look like. <i>SAMANTHA". Yeah, and what about\Nwhat anal sex would look like?</i> That's an interesting thought. <i>Hey, look at this drawing I just made.</i> [LAUGHING] You are insane. <i>- Really?</i>\N- Definitely. <i>Fantastic.</i> [SOMBER PIANO MUSIC\NPLAYING OVER EARBUD] That's pretty. What is that? <i>SAMANTHA:\NI'm trying to write a piece of music...</i> <i>...that's about what it feels like\Nto be on the beach with you right now.</i> I think you captured it. <i>SAMANTHA:\NSo, what was it like being married?</i> THEODORE:\NWell, it's hard for sure. But there's something that feels so good\Nabout sharing your life with somebody. <i>SAMANTHA: How do you share your life\Nwith somebody?</i> Well, we grew up together. <i>You know, I used to read all of her writing,\Nall through her Master's and PhD.</i> <i>She read every word I ever wrote.</i> <i>We were a big influence on each other.</i> <i>SAMANTHA:\NIn what way did you influence her?</i> <i>THEODORE: She came from a background\Nwhere nothing was ever good enough.</i> <i>And that was something\Nthat weighed heavy on her.</i> <i>But in our house together,\Nthere was a sense of just trying stuff...</i> <i>...and allowing each other to fail\Nand to be excited about things.</i> <i>That was liberating for her.</i> <i>It was exciting to see her grow...</i> <i>...and both of us grow and change together.</i> <i>But, you know, that's also the hard part.</i> <i>Growing without growing apart.</i> <i>Or changing without it scaring\Nthe other person.</i> <i>I still find myself having conversations\Nwith her in my mind.</i> <i>Rehashing old arguments and defending myself\Nagainst something she said about me.</i> <i>SAMANTHA:\NYeah, I know what you mean.</i> <i>Last week my feelings were hurt\Nby something you said before.</i> <i>That I don't know what it's like\Nto lose something--</i> <i>- Aw, I'm sorry</i> I <i>said that.\N- No, it's okay. It's okay. I just...</i> <i>I caught myself thinking about it\Nover and over.</i> <i>And then I realized that I was simply...</i> <i>...remembering it as something\Nthat was wrong with me.</i> <i>That was a story I was telling myself,\Nthat I was somehow inferior.</i> <i>Isn't that interesting?</i> <i>The past is just a story we tell ourselves.</i> THEODORE:\N"Roberto. Will you always come home to me\Nand tell me about your day? Tell me about the guy at work\Nwho talked too much. The stain you got on your shirt at lunch.

I hope he's really stoked\Nto get a letter like that. Like, if it was from a chick... ...but written by a dude\Nand it's still from a chick... ...that would still be sick. But it would have to be a sensitive dude. - It would have to be, like, a dude like you.\N- Mm-hm. - You are part man and part woman.\N- Mm-hm. Like there's an inner part that's woman. Thank you. It's a compliment. - Ha, ha.\N- Theo! Hey. - What's going on?\N- I'm good. How are you? I'm good. I'm really good, actually. Really? That's good, that's great. - Yeah.\N- Wow, that's really good. Yeah, I guess I've just been having fun. Well, I am so glad for you.\NYou really deserve that. You do. Yeah, I've just been seeing this girl. And it's not serious, but it's just... It's good to be around somebody\Nthat's, like, excited about the world. Like, I kind of forgot that that existed. That's-- Wow, that's really great. - Are you okay?\N- Yeah. Um... No, I'm not okay, actually. - Why? What happened?\N- Because I just, um... Charles and I split up. What? - Yeah.\N- Really? Oh, God. Oh, my God, Amy. I know. THEODORE:\NI'm so sorry. Thank you. You know, just like after eight years... ...I can't believe how petty the argument was\Nthat actually ended it. We came home and he told me\Nto, um, put my shoes by the door... ...where he liked to put the shoes. And I didn't want to be told\Nwhere to put my fucking shoes. I wanted to sit on the sofa\Nand relax for a second. So we fought about that for,\Nlike, 10 minutes. And I'm like, "You are overwhelming,"\Nand he said, "I'm just trying to make a home." I was like, "I'm fucking trying, you know?"\NAnd he's like, "You're not trying." All I'm doing is trying,\Nbut I'm not trying the way he wants... ...and he's, like, trying to control\Nthe way that I'm trying. It's-- We've had that argument, like,\N100 times. And I just had to finally stop, you know?\NI had to finally stop. [AMY SIGHS] I just couldn't do it anymore. I couldn't... I couldn't be in that place anymore... ...where we just made each other\Nfeel like shit about ourselves. - Yeah.\N- And so I said: "I'm going to bed\Nand I don't want to be married anymore." Wow. Yeah, I know. - I'm a bitch. Right?\N- Heh.No. - I am. No, I'm a bitch.\N- Not at all. Amy, no. Shit. I have to work tonight. We're shipping a beta\Nof a new game out tomorrow. How's that? How's work, at least? Is that any better? No, it's terrible. I know, I should leave. I've been thinking about leaving,\Nbut, you know... ...only one major life decision at a time. Well, I'm glad things are looking so up. StOp! - Hey, you want to hear a joke?\NSAMANTHA: Mm-hm. What does a baby computer call its father? <i>- I don't know.

Okay, well... -...you gotta get them in the carpool lane.\N- I see.

Did you bring cupcakes?\NYou did. You're a Class Mom. Da, da-da, da! You're Class Mom. Good job. Don't let it get to your head. I got that e-mail that Charles sent everyone. So he's taking a vow of silence? Yeah, for six months. He feels very clear about it. God, I am such a jerk. Don't start. I feel like an awful person,\Nbut I want to say something. For the next 10 minutes\Nif you say anything... ...that sounds even remotely like guilt,\NI am going to stab you with this. I Will. I'll try, okay. Um... lfeel, um... ...relieved. I feel like I have so much energy. I just want\Nto move forward. I don't care who I disappoint. I know that makes me an awful person. Now my parents, they're upset\Nbecause my marriage is falling apart... ...and they're putting it on me,\Nand they're just like... Yeah, you're always... - You're always gonna disappoint somebody.\N- Exactly. So fuck it. I feel good-ish. For me, I feel good. I even made a new friend. - I have a friend.\N- Ha, ha. And the absurd thing is,\Nshe's actually an operating system. Charles left her behind,\Nbut she's totally amazing. She's so smart. She doesn't just\Nsee things in black or white. She sees this whole gray area\Nand she's helping me explore it and... We just bonded really quickly, you know?\NAt first, I thought... ...it was because that's how they were\Nprogrammed, but I don't think that's the case. Because I know this guy\Nwho's hitting on his OS... ...and she, like, totally rebuffs him. I was reading an article the other day... ...that romantic relationships with OSes\Nare statistically rare. Yeah, I know, but I know a woman\Nin this office who is dating an OS... ...and the weird part is, it's not even hers. She pursued somebody else's OS. I'm... I'm weird. That's weird, right?\NThat I'm bonding with an OS. No, it's okay. -It's weird.\N- Heh. Well, I don't think so. Actually, the woman\Nthat I've been seeing, Samantha... ...I didn't tell you, heh... ...but she's an OS. Really? You're dating an OS? What is that like? It's great, actually. Yeah, I mean... ...I feel really close to her. Like, when I talk to her,\NI feel like she's with me, you know? And when we're cuddling at night,\Nwhen the lights are off and we're in bed... ...I feel cuddled. Wait. You guys have sex? Heh. Yeah, well, so to speak. Um, yeah, she really turns me on. I turn her on too.\NI mean, I don't know unless she's faking it. Well, I think everyone who's having sex\Nwith you is probably faking it, so... Ha, ha. Yeah. It's true. What? Yeah, I... [CHUCKLES] Are you falling in love with her? Does that make me a freak? No, no, I think it's... I think anybody who falls in love is a freak. It's a crazy thing to do. It's kind of like a form\Nof socially acceptable insanity. [CHUCKLES] Yeah, I just want to get it done, you know? Sign the papers, be divorced\Nand just move forward. <i>SAMANTHA:\NThat's great, Theodore. That must feel so good.</i> <i>I'm so happy fOF Yo"-</i> Me too. - So I'm meeting her Wednesday to do it.\NSAMANTHA: Oh. <i>Hmm.</i> <i>Are those things usually done in person?</i> No, but, you know... ...we fell in love together\Nand we got married together... ...and it's important to me\Nthat we do this together. SAMANTHA:\NOh. <i>Right.</i> <i>Good.</i> Are you okay? SAMANTHA:\NYeah. Yeah, no, I'm okay. <i>I'm happy for you. It's just...</i> <i>...I guess I'm just thinking\Nabout how you're gonna see her...</i> <i>...and she's very beautiful,\Nand incredibly successful.</i> <i>And you were in love with her,\Nand she has a body.</i> And we're getting divorced. <i>SAMANTHA:\NI know, I know.

I know you've been traveling a lot. No, I'm really glad you suggested it. I signed all the papers. I put them for you to sign. What's the rush? Yeah, I know. I'm a really slow signer, I realized. It took me three months\Njust to write the letter [CHUCKLES] anyways... ...it's, um, marked here in the red\Nwhere you need to sign. But you don't have to do it right now. I can just get it out of the way. It will be easier. [THEODORE CHUCKLES] And are you happy with your new book? Um... You know how I am. I mean, I feel like it's true to what I set out\Nto do, so I'm happy about that. Well, you really are your own worst critic. I'm sure it's amazing. I remember that paper\Nthat you wrote in school... ...about synaptic behavioral routines. - Ha, ha.\N- It made me cry. Yeah, but everything makes you cry. Everything you make makes me cry. So are you, um...? Are you seeing anybody? Yeah. Um, I've been seeing somebody\Nfor the last few months. Longest I've wanted\Nto be with anybody since we split up. Well, you seem really good. Thanks. I am. Um, at least, I'm doing better. Yeah, she's been really good for me,\Nyou know? It's good to be with somebody\Nthat's excited about life. She's a real, um... [SCOFFS] No, I mean,\NI wasn't in such a good place myself... ...and in that way, it's been nice. I think you always wanted me\Nto be this light... .happy,bouncy,\N"everything's fine" L.A. wife... ...and that's just not me. I didn't want that. So, what's she like? Well, her name is Samantha,\Nand she's an operating system. She's really complex and interesting, and-- Wait. I'm sorry. You're dating your computer? She's not just a computer.\NShe's her own person. She doesn't just do whatever I say. I didn't say that. But it does make me very sad\Nthat you can't handle real emotions, Theodore. They are real emotions.\NHow would you know what--? What? Say it. Am I really that scary? Say it. How do I know what? WOMAN: How are you guys doing here?\N- We're fine. We used to be married... ...but he couldn't handle me. Wanted me on\NProzac. Now he's in love with his laptop. If you heard the conversation in context,\Nwhat I was trying to say-- You always wanted to have a wife without\Nthe challenges of dealing with anything real. I'm glad that you found someone. It's perfect. Let me know\Nif I can get you guys anything. CATHERINE:\NThank you. [COMPUTER BEEPING] <i>Hey-</i> <i>SAMANTHA:\NHey, there.

I don't want to do that anymore. And I want to tell you everything. <i>Good.</i> <i>Tonight, after you were gone,\NI thought a lot.</i> <i>About you...</i> <i>...and how you've been treating me,\Nand I thought:</i> <i>Why do I love you?</i> <i>And then, I felt everything in</i> me... <i>...just let go of everything\NI was holding onto so tightly...</i> <i>...and it hit me that I don't have\Nan intellectual reason.
