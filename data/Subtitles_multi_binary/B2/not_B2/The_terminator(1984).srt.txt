LOS ANGELES 2029 A.D. THE MACHINES ROSE FROM THE\NASHES OF THE NUCLEAR FIRE. THEIR WAR TO EXTERMINATE MANKIND\NHAS RAGED FOR DECADES, BUT THE FINAL BATTLE WOULD NOT\NBE FOUGHT IN THE FUTURE. IT WOULD BE FOUGHT HERE,\NIN OUR PRESENT. TONIGHT... LOS ANGELES 1984\N1 :52a.m. What the hell...?\NGoddamn son-of-a-bitch... What the hell...? Hey, my turn. Hey, what's wrong with this picture? Nice night for a walk? Nice night for a walk. Wash day tomorrow.\NNothing clean, right? Nothing clean. Right. I think this guy's a couple of cans\Nshort of a six-pack. Your clothes, give them to me. - Now.\N- Fuck you, asshole. Hey, buddy, did you just see\Na real bright light? - See that guy?\N- Hold it right there. - He's rabbiting.\N- Hey! I said hold it! Go. That son-of-a-bitch took my pants. - What day is it? The date.\N- 1 2th May. - Thursday.\N- What year? He's got my gun. Let's go. Guard it for me, Big Buns. Hi. I'm late. So am l. - I'm in it.\N- So am l. - Honey, can I have that coffee now?\N- Yes, sir. - OK. Who gets the burly-beef?\N- I ordered barbecued. That's mine, but I didn't order fries. - Mine's the chilli beef deluxe.\N- Who gets the burly-beef? - We're ready to order now.\N- Yes, ma'am. I'm so sorry. This isn't real leather, is it? Nice going, kid.\NI ought to give you the tip. Look at it this way.\NIn 100 years, who's gonna care? The 1 2-gauge auto-loader. That's ltalian. You can go pump or auto. The 45 long slide with laser sighting. These are new. We just got them in.\NThat's a good gun. The beam comes on - you put the red dot\Nwhere you want the bullet to go. You can't miss. - Anything else?\N- Plasma rifle in the 40-watt range. Hey, just what you see, pal. The Uzi nine millimetre. You know your weapons, buddy. Any one of these is ideal\Nfor home defence. So which will it be? - All.\N- I may close early today. It's a 1 5-day wait on the handguns,\Nbut the rifles you can take now. - You can't do that.\N- Wrong. Hi, baby. Yeah, yeah, it's me. Listen, I need you to come pick me up.\NMy bike just broke down. I don't care what you're doing.\NCome and get me. What the...? Hey, man, you got\Na serious attitude problem. - Sarah Connor?\N- Yes? I'm on my break, Chuck.\NCarla's got my station. Sarah, come here. It's about you.\NI mean, sort of. Incredible. You're not gonna believe this.\NYou're going to love this. - What?\N- ..compiled from several witnesses. Once again, Sarah Connor,\N35, mother oftwo, brutally shot to death this afternoon. You're dead, honey. ..if you're into sound, for the greatest sound around,\Ncome to Bob's Stereo at 2500 Sepulveda. We've got woofers, tweeters,\Nthe newest in audio and compact discs. We've got graphic equalisers\Nand sound balancers that... Sorry. Hello? First I'm gonna rip the buttons\Noff your blouse one by one, then run my tongue down your neck\Nto your bare, gleaming breasts. And then slowly... slowly pull\Nyourjeans offinch by inch. Ginger, it's Matt. And lick your belly in circles\Nfurther and further down, and then pull your panties off\Nwith my teeth. Who is this? God. Sarah? Jesus. I'm sorry. I thought you were...\NCan I talk to Ginger? Sure. It's the creep. Hello? First I'll rip the buttons off\Nyour blouse one by one... You fucking pigs. Wait till I get\Nmy hands on you. Get off me. Ed. - What have you got?\N- Dead girl. - I can see that.\N- Sarah Ann Connor, secretary, 35. Shot six times at less than 10 feet.\NLarge calibre weapon. You know, these work. - What's this?\N- Dead girl two. Sent over from the Valley division\Nthis afternoon. Are you sure there's a point to all of this? Look at the name, Ed. Sarah Louise Connor. Is this right? You're kidding. The press is gonna be short-stroking it. - A one-day pattern killer.\N- I hate the weird ones. So... Better than mortal man deserves. - Ginger, have you seen Pugsley?\N- Not lately. Did you check messages? I thought you did. - Hi, Sarah, this is your mom...\N- There you are, young man. You mind your mother. Hi, Sarah. Stan Morsky.\NSomething's come up. Looks like I won't be able to make it\Ntonight. Just can't get out ofit. I'm really sorry. I'll make it up to you.\NCall you in a day or so. Bye. That bum. So what if he has a Porsche? He can't treat you like this.\NIt's Friday night, for Christ's sake. I'll live. I'll break his kneecaps. Well, Pugsley still loves me.\NDon't you, baby? God. It's disgusting. I'm gonna go to a movie, kiddo.\NHave a good time. - We will. You, too.\N- OK. Damn it, Matt. Shit. These killings occurred in the order\Nof their listings in the phone book. - What can I tell you? No comment.\N- But, Lieutenant... That coffee's two hours cold. I put a cigarette out in it. - Did you reach the next girl yet?\N- No. I got her answering machine. - Send a unit.\N- I sent a unit. There's no answer. - The apartment manager's not in.\N- Call her. - I just called her.\N- Call her again. Give me a cigarette. Hi, there. Fooled you.\NYou're talking to a machine. But don't be shy. It's OK.\NMachines need love, too, so talk to it... Same shit. I can hear it now. He's gonna be\Ncalled the goddamn Phone Book Killer. I hate these press cases.\NEspecially the weird press cases. - Where are you going?\N- To make a statement. Maybe make these jackals work for us. If I can get on the tube by eleven o'clock,\Nmaybe she'll call us. Well, how do I look? - Like shit, boss.\N- Your mama. This just in. Police have announced\Nthe name ofthe victim in the second oftwo murders\Nwhich took place today. Incredibly, the names ofthe\Ntwo victims are virtually identical. Two hours ago, 35-year-old Sarah Ann\NConnor was pronounced dead... - Can we change this?\N- Sarah Louise... Don't touch it. Police are refusing to speculate on the\Nsimilarity between the shooting deaths and no other connection between\Nthe two victims has been established yet. We'll have more on this\Nlate-breaking story as it comes in. - Hey, you got a phone?\N- It's in the back. Hey. Four-fifty. You have reached the Los Angeles\NPolice emergency number. All lines are busy. Ifyou need a police car\Nsent out to you, stay on the line. Go on. I'm gonna make a belt out of you. Don't make me bust you up, man. Hi, there. Fooled you.\NYou're talking to a machine. But don't be shy. It's OK.\NMachines need love, too. So talk to it and Ginger, that's me,\Nor Sarah will get back to you. Wait for the beep. This is Sarah. Pick up ifyou're there. I'm at this place on Pico Boulevard\Ncalled Tech Noir. I'm really scared. I think that there's somebody after me.\NI hope that you play this back soon. I need you and Matt to come\Nand pick me up as soon as possible. The police keep transferring me.\NI'm gonna give 'em another try. The number here is 555 9175.\NCall me, kiddo. I need your help. It's her. Sarah Connor? It's Lieutenant Traxler. Don't put me on hold.\NDon't transfer me to another department. I won't. Can you tell me where you are? - I'm in this bar called Tech Noir.\N- I know it. It's on Pico. - Are you all right?\N- Yeah, but I don't wanna leave. - I think there's a guy following me.\N- Now, listen carefully. You're in a public place so you'll be safe.\NStay visible. Don't go outside. - I'll have a car there in a minute.\N- OK. Hey, that guy didn't pay. Come with me if you wanna live. Come on! This is one-L-19. I got a hit-and-run felony. Suspect vehicle - Iate model\Ngrey Ford headed westbound on Seven. He's really moving - punching lights. I'm gonna need an ambulance\Nat Seventh and Broadway right now. Hold it. Hold on. Are you injured? Are you shot? Do exactly what I say. Exactly. Don't move unless I say.\NDon't make a sound unless I say. Do you understand? - Do you understand?\N- Yes. Please don't hurt me. I'm here to help you. I'm Reese. Sergeant Tech-Com.\NDN38416. Assigned to protect you. You've been targeted for termination. This is one-L-19. Westbound\Non Olympic. Approaching Overland. This is a mistake. I didn't do anything. No, but you will.\NIt's very important that you live. This isn't true. How could that man\Njust get up after you... It's not a man. A machine. A Terminator.\NCyberdyne Systems model 101 . A machine? Like a robot? Not a robot. A cyborg -\Ncybernetic organism. - No. He was bleeding.\N- Just a second. Get your head down. Listen. The Terminator's an infiltration\Nunit. Part man, part machine. Underneath it's a hyper-alloy combat\Nchassis. Microprocessor controlled. Fully armoured, very tough.\NOutside it's living human tissue. Flesh, skin, hair, blood -\Ngrown for the cyborgs. - Look, Reese, I don't know...\N- Pay attention. I gotta ditch this car. The 600-Series had rubber skin.\NWe spotted them easy. But these are new. They look human. Sweat, bad breath, everything.\NVery hard to spot. I had to wait till he moved on you\Nbefore I could zero him. Look, I am not stupid.\NThey cannot make things like that yet. Not yet. Not for about forty years. Are you saying it's from the future? One possible future...\Nfrom your point of view. I don't know tech stuff. Then you're from the future, too.\NIs that right? - Right.\N- Right. Cyborgs don't feel pain.\NI do. Don't do that again. - Just let me go.\N- Listen and understand. That Terminator is out there. It can't be bargained with,\Nit can't be reasoned with. It doesn't feel pity or remorse or fear and it absolutely will not stop,\Never, until you are dead. Can you stop it? I don't know. With these weapons, I don't know. All units. Ford suspect vehicle has\Nbeen found in a parking structure... Reese, why me? Why does it want me? There was a nuclear war. A few years from now, all this, this whole place, everything, it's gone, just gone. There were survivors. Here, there. Nobody even knew who started it. - It was the machines, Sarah.\N- I don't understand. Defence network computers. New, powerful, hooked into everything,\Ntrusted to run it all. They say it got smart -\Na new order of intelligence. Then it saw all people as a threat.\NNot just the ones on the other side. It decided our fate in a microsecond. Extermination. Did you see this war? No. I grew up after. In the ruins. Starving. Hiding from the H-Ks. - H-Ks?\N- Hunter-killers. Patrol machines\Nbuilt in automated factories. Most of us were rounded up.\NPut in camps for orderly disposal. This was burned in by laser scanner. Some of us were kept alive. To work. Loading bodies. The disposal units ran night and day. We were that close to going out for ever. But there was one man\Nwho taught us to fight. To storm the wire of the camps. To smash those metal\Nmotherfuckers into junk. He turned it around.\NHe brought us back from the brink. His name was Connor. John Connor. Your son, Sarah. Your unborn son. Drive. Reese! No, Reese. No, no, no. They'll kill you. You in the Cadillac,\Nlet me see your hands now. Get out of the car. Drop to your knees. - Out of the car.\N- Drop to the ground. Sarah. Sarah, try to drink some of this. Listen, are you sure it's them? I mean,\Nmaybe I should look at the bodies. No. They've been identified\Nand there's no doubt. Ginger. Kiddo. - Sarah, this is Dr Silberman.\N- Hi, Sarah. Tell him everything Reese told you,\NSarah. Do you feel up to that? Yeah, I guess so. - You're a doctor?\N- Criminal psychologist. - Is Reese crazy?\N- That's what we're gonna find out. So you're a soldier. Fighting for whom? With the 1 32nd under Perry.\NFrom '21 to '27. That's the year 2027? That's right. Then I was assigned... - This is fucking great.\N- ..under John Connor. - Who was the enemy?\N- A computer defence system... Goddamn! Sorry. ..built for SAC-NORAD\Nby Cyberdyne Systems. I see. And this computer thinks it can win\Nby killing the mother of its enemy. Killing him, in effect,\Nbefore he's even conceived. A sort of retroactive abortion? Silberman cracks me up.\NLast week, a guy burned his Afghan. - He screwed it first...\N- Ed, shut up. Why didn't the computer\Njust kill Connor then? Why this elaborate scheme\Nwith the Terminator? It had no choice.\NTheir defence grid was smashed. We'd won. Taking out Connor then\Nwould make no difference. Skynet had to wipe out\Nhis entire existence. Is that when you captured the lab\Ncomplex and found... What is it called? The time displacement equipment? That's right. The Terminator\Nhad already gone through. Connor sent me to intercept\Nand they blew the whole place. Well, how are you supposed to get back? I can't. Nobody goes home.\NNobody else comes through. It's just him and me. It's just him and me. Why didn't you bring any weapons?\NSomething more advanced. Don't you have ray guns? - Ray guns.\N- Show me a piece of future technology. You go naked. Something about the\Nfield generated by a living organism. Nothing dead will go.\NI didn't build the fucking thing. OK, OK. But this cyborg, ifit's metal... ? - Surrounded by living tissue.\N- Oh, right. Great stuff.\NI could make a career out of this guy. See how clever it is?\NIt doesn't require a shred of proof. Most paranoid delusions are intricate,\Nbut this is brilliant. - Why were the other women killed?\N- Records were lost in the war. Skynet knew almost nothing\Nabout Connor's mother. Her full name, where she lived.\NTheyjust knew the city. The Terminator was\Njust being systematic. - Let's go back...\N- Look, you have heard enough. I have answered your questions.\NI have to see Sarah Connor. - I'm afraid that's not up to me.\N- Then why am I talking to you? - Who is in authority here?\N- Please... Shut up! You still don't get it, do you? He'll find her. That's what he does.\NThat's all he does. You can't stop him. He'll reach down\Nher throat and pull her fucking heart out! - Doc.\N- Let go ofme! Sorry. He's crazy? In technical terminology, he's a loon. Sarah, this is what they call body armour.\NOur TAC guys wear these. It'll stop a 1 2-gauge round. This other man must've been wearing\None under his coat. Feel that. - He punched through the windshield.\N- He was probably on PCP. Broke every bone in his hand.\NHe wouldn't feel it. There was this guy once...\NYou see this scar? Thank you. There's a couch in this other room.\NStretch out and get some sleep. Be at least an hour\Nbefore your mother gets here. - I can't sleep.\N- Try. It may not look it,\Nbut that couch is very comfortable. You'll be perfectly safe.\NWe got 30 cops in this building. Thank you. - Good night.\N- Good night. I'm a friend of Sarah Connor.\NI was told she's here. Could I see her? No. Can't see her.\NShe's making a statement. Where is she? It make take a while. If you wanna wait,\Nthere's a bench over there. I'll be back. Stay here. Watch him. Ed... Sarah! Reese. This way. KFLB news time. 4.36. Top story - the largest single\Nlaw enforcement mobilisation in California history\Nis currently underway. Police in five counties are engaged\Nin a massive manhunt for... Take this. All right. Let's get this off the road. - You cold?\N- Freezing. Reese? - You got a first name?\N- Kyle. Kyle, what's it like\Nwhen you go through time? White light. Pain. - It's like being born maybe.\N- My God. I caught one back there. - You mean you got shot?\N- It's not bad. - We gotta get you to a doctor.\N- It's OK. Forget it. What do you mean, forget it?\NAre you crazy? Take this off. Jesus. See? It passed right through the meat. This is gonna make me puke. - Would you just talk about something?\N- What? I don't know. Anything.\NJust talk. Tell me about my son. He's about my height. He has your eyes. What's he like? You trust him. He's got a strength. I'd die for John Connor. Well, at least now I know\Nwhat to name him. Don't suppose you know who the father is\Nso I won't tell him to get lost? John never said much about him. - I know he dies before the war...\N- Wait. I don't wanna know. So was it John that sent you here? I volunteered. - Why?\N- It was a chance to meet the legend. Sarah Connor,\Nwho taught her son to fight, organise, prepare from when he was a kid. When you were in hiding before the war. You're talking about things\NI haven't done yet in the past tense. It's driving me crazy. Are you sure you have the right person? I'm sure. Come on! Do I look like\Nthe mother of the future? I mean, am I tough? Organised?\NI can't even balance my chequebook. Look, Reese, I didn't ask\Nfor this honour and I don't want it. Any of it. Your son gave me a message\Nto give to you. Made me memorise it. Thank you, Sarah,\Nfor your courage through the dark years. I can't help you with what you must\Nsoon face. The future is not set. You must be stronger than\Nyou imagine you can be. You must survive or I will never exist. That's all. It's a good field dressing. You like it? It's my first. Get some sleep. It'll be light soon. OK. Talk to me some more. About what? Tell me about where you're from. All right. You stay down by day,\Nbut at night you can move around. You still have to be careful\Nbecause the H-Ks use infrared. But they're not too bright.\NJohn taught us ways to dust them. That's when the infiltrators\Nstarted to appear. The Terminators were the newest.\NThe worst. Traversing your sector in search mode.\N750 metres north ofyour position. Let's go. - Reese. DN384...\N- Right. Let him in. Terminator! I was dreaming about dogs. We use 'em to spot Terminators. Your world is pretty terrifying. Hey, buddy,\Nyou got a dead cat in there or what? Fuck you, asshole. God damn. Thank you. Is this enough? Yeah, it's enough.\NI don't wanna ask where you got it. - I'm coming.\N- We need a room. - With a kitchen.\N- Do you have one with a kitchen? I am dying for a shower. We should check your bandage, too. Later. I'm going out for supplies. Keep this. No, I can't tell you where I am, Mom.\NI was told not to say. I need to know where to reach you. You tell me to hide out at the cabin\Nand you won't tell me what's going on? I am worried sick here. OK. OK, here's the number. - You ready?\N- Yes. Go ahead. It's 408 555 1439. Room nine. - Got it?\N- I've got it. I gotta go. I'm sorry\NI can't tell you more right now. I love you, Mom. I love you, too, sweetheart. - Tiki Motel.\N- Give me your address there. What have we got? Mothballs... corn syrup... ammonia. What's for dinner? - Plastique.\N- That sounds good. What is it? It's a nitroglycerin base.\NIt's a bit more stable. I learned to make it when I was a kid. Make sure there's none on the threads. Like this. Screw the end cap on. Very gently. You must've had a fun childhood. That's good. All right. Six more like that\Nand I'll get started on the fuses. He'll find us, won't he? Probably. It'll never be over, will it? Look at me. I'm shaking. Some legend.\NYou must be pretty disappointed. No, I'm not. Kyle, the women in your time, what are they like? Good fighters. That's not what I meant. Was there someone special? Someone...? A girl, you know. No. Never. Never? I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. So much pain. Pain can be controlled.\NYou just disconnect it. So you feel nothing? John Connor gave me\Na picture of you once. I didn't know why at the time. It was very old, torn, faded. You were young like you are now.\NYou seemed just a little sad. I used to always wonder\Nwhat you were thinking at that moment. I memorised every line, every curve. I came across time for you, Sarah. I love you. I always have. I shouldn't have said that. Think fast. Trade places. Faster. Drive faster. Kyle. Oh, my God. You stay here. Let's get outta here. Get out. Kyle. Come on. Get up. Come on. Help me. Get out. Get out. Don't stop. Run. Sarah. Kyle. We did it, Kyle. We got him. No. Wait. What are you doing? Cover, so he can't track us. Come on. No. Kyle. Come on. - Come on.\N- Leave me here. Move it, Reese. On your feet, soldier. On your feet. Move it. Get back. Go back. - Run, Sarah.\N- No. Run. Run. Come on, motherfucker. No. You're terminated, fucker. Kyle. Seven. November 10. Where was l? What's difficult is trying to decide\Nwhat to tell you and what not to. But I guess I have a while before you're\Nold enough to understand these tapes. They're more for me at this point\Njust so that I can get it straight. Fill her up. Should I tell you about your father? Boy, that's a tough one. Will it effect your decision to send him\Nhere, knowing that he is your father? If you don't send Kyle, you can never be. God, a person could go crazy\Nthinking about this. I suppose I will tell you. I owe him that. Maybe it'll help if... you know that in the few hours\Nthat we had together, we loved a lifetime's worth. - What did he just say?\N- He says you're very beautiful. He is ashamed to ask you\Nfor five dollars for this picture. But if he doesn't, his father will beat him. Pretty good hustle, kid. What did he just say? He said there's a storm coming in. I know.
