(BIRDS AND ANIMALS CHATTERING) <i>BAGHEERA: Many strange tales\Nare told of this Jungle...</i> <i>but none so strange...</i> <i>as the tale of the cub we call Mowgli.</i> (GRUNTING AND PANTING) (GROWLING) (GROWLING) (GRUNTING AND\NPANTING CONTINUES) -(GROANS)\N-(GROWLING) You must be the very\Nworst wolf I've ever seen. Yeah, but if that branch didn't break,\NI would've made it. Crossing upwind,\Nbreaking from your numbers. If you can't learn to run with the Pack... one of these days,\Nyou'll be someones dinner. - How'd we do?\N- Not Mowgli, again. - He's never gonna make the Council.\N- YOUNG MALE WOLF: Let's go! YOUNG FEMALE WOLF:\NRace you to the top! (LAUGHS) It was higher ground. Wolves don't hide in trees. I can't keep up with them, Bagheera. I tried. I just picked the wrong tree. BAGHEERA: it was a dead tree. How was I supposed to know\Nit was dead? It had a fig vine. Any tree girdled by a creeper\Nis either dead or close to it. - These are things a wolf must know.\N- Yeah. But if the branch didn't break,\NI would've made it. I realise you weren't born a wolf... but couldn't you at least act like one? <i>BAGHEERA'. When I found him...</i> <i>many years 2290--</i> <i>he was just an infant,\Nabandoned in the woods.</i> YOUNG MALE WOLF: Get the deer! <i>BAGHEERA: If he\Nwas going to survive...</i> <i>I knew he needed a people.</i> <i>A people to protect him.</i> <i>That's why I entrusted him\Nto the wolves.</i> AKELA: Look well, wolves. <i>BAGHEERA: Akela was\Na just and noble leader.</i> <i>He allowed Mowgli to dwell\Namong them, all those years.</i> <i>The trouble was, wolves grew so fast...</i> <i>and Mowgli...</i> <i>let's just say he liked to take his time.</i> Mowgli, pick me up high! - My turn! (LAUGHS)\N- Stop. Not now. <i>BAGHEERA: It was Raksha\Nwho raised him.</i> <i>She was the only mother he ever knew.</i> - Come on, let's play!\N- MOWGLI: I don't feel like playing, Gray. Come on, you're my brother.\NYou have to play with me. Let's go chase some mice. (LAUGHS) How did it go? Caught me again. If it's meant to be... it Will be. Let me hear the Law. ALL: "This is the Law of the Jungle... "as old and as true as the sky. "The Wolf that keeps it will prosper... "but the Wolf that breaks it will die. "Like the creeper that girdles\Nthe tree trunk...

SHERE KHAN: I can't help but notice... there's this strange odour today. What is it, this scent that I'm on? I almost... I almost think it was some kind of... man-cub. Mowgli belongs\Nto my Pack, Shere Khan. Mowgli? They've given it a name. When was it we came to adopt\Nman into the Jungle? He's just a cub. Does my face not remind you\Nof what a grown man can do? Shift your hunting ground\Nfor a few years... and everyone forgets\Nhow the Law works. Well, let me remind you. A man-cub becomes man... and man is forbidden! (ROARING) - What do you know about Law?\N- Raksha. Hunting for pleasure. Killing for power. RAKSHA: You've never known Law.\NThe cub is mine! Mine to me. So, go back to where you came from,\Nyou burned beast! (GROWLING) The tiger knows who rules\Nthis part of the Jungle. I'm sure he doesn't mean to come here\Nand make threats. Especially during a Water Truce. No, I'm deeply respectful of these Laws\Nthat keep us safe. So, here's my promise. Nothing lasts forever. The rains will return\Nand the river will rise. And when this rock disappears,\Nthat Truce will end. SHERE KHAN:\NYou want to protect him, fine. But ask yourselves,\Nhow many lives is a man-cub worth? <i>BAGHEERA: How many lives?</i> <i>Who could answer that question?</i> (THUNDER RUMBLING) (CROAKING) (THUNDER RUMBLING) - ALL: The rain!\N- Rain! - Rain!\N- The rain!

RAMA: He's got to go. Look at the skies. Shere Khan may be heading here\Nas we speak. (ARGUING CONTINUES) RAKSHA: Please! I'm leaving. (ARGUING STOPS) I don't want to see anyone get hurt. Mowgli, go back to the den! A man-cub belongs with man. We raised him as one of our own! - He'll have the boy, either way.\N- BAGHEERA: Akela. Maybe I can be of help. The boy's right. Maybe it's time he found another people. - No.\N- I'm the one who brought him to you. And now I'll return him\Nto where he belongs. I won't let you. He's my cub! We knew this day would come. We are the only family he's ever known! AKELAI Raksha. It's the only place he'll be safe. <i>It's okay, ami.</i> I won't go far. I'll come back and visit. Never forget this... You're mine. Mine to me. No matter where you go,\Nor what they may call you... you will always be...

Maybe the crocodiles. What about the rhinos? They always let me hang around. Of course, the rhinos sleep standing up. I don't think I'd be very good at that. It's either the turtles or the crocodiles. Which one do you think is better? BAGHEERAI Neither. What do you mean? I'm bringing you to the man village. What? Bagheera, I don't know man. YOU Will. MOWGLI: You always said\Nwe're not supposed to go near a man village. BAGHEERA: That was different. Why is it different? You always said, "Stay away\Nfrom the man village... "because you might fall in a trap... "or get eaten,\Nor get hurt by flying rocks." I know what I said. Whoa. Elephants. - Bow your head.\N- Why? Show them respect. BAGHEERA: The elephants\Ncreated this Jungle. Where they made furrows\Nwith their tusks, the rivers ran. Where they blew with\Ntheir trunks, the leaves fell. They made all that belongs. The mountains, the trees... the birds in the trees. But they did not make you. That is why you must go. What if I live with the nilgai? No. Or the mongoose? This is not a discussion. But this is my home! I don't even know what man's like. You'll learn. But I wanna stay in the Jungle. Why do I have to go there? Because the Jungle\Nis no longer safe for you.

No. Why are you bringing me\Nto the man village if you found me in the Jungle? And why does the tiger\Nhate me so much? Does he know me?\NSure seems like he knows me. Down. What? Now we have to bow\Nto the buffalo, too? Listen to me. This is not a game. You're gonna run to that ravine. What are you talking about? Go to the north,\Nwhere the sky glows at night.

The man-cub has left the Jungle. I thought I made myself clear. I wanted him turned over to me. We no longer harbour him. He has left the Pack. And where, may I ask, has he gone? He's with his own kind now. So, the man-cub has left the Jungle. AKE LA: That's rig ht. You and I no longer have a quarrel. And, most importantly... we have peace. I guess it's done, then. Unless I can draw him... back out! (ROARS) Akela! (ROARS) Have I got your attention now? I didn't want it to be this way. I made it so simple. All I asked for was one thing,\Nand you denied me!

Oh, those must have been females! (GROANS LOUDLY) BALOO: They look like males\Nfrom down here. Females do sting. Just put some honey on those. - Honey? Really?\N- Yeah. You put it on, you lick it off.\NYou feel much better. It's nature's ointment. (WHISPERS) I put it everywhere. Thanks. Okay, so, we're even now! Hold on a minute. What's your name anyway? We were never properly introduced. - Mowgli.\N- Mowgli? Mowgli is a terrific name. I bet you got that one\Nall to yourself, too. Hey! Mowgli, look... I got a lot of gathering to do\Nthese next couple of weeks... on account of the hibernation. I could really use your help. You know, if you stuck around... I can't. I have to go to the man village. (STUTTERS) Uh... For what reason, man village? I don't have a choice.\NThere's a tiger hunting me. Really? Why a tiger? Because I'm a man-cub, all right? Just leave me alone. Hey! Mowgli, my friend,\Nmy buddy, my pal. Slow down a second, handsome. Bagheera said I have to go\Nto the man village. Oh, Bagheera! I know him. Sure. You know what his problem is? He always plays by the rules. And, sometimes rules\Nwere meant to be... well, not necessarily broken,\Nbut certainly bent. And definitely reinterpreted.\NDon't you think? He told me to go to the man village,\Nso, that's where I'm gonna go! Okay, fine. You wanna go to the man village,\Nhave it your way. In fact, I'll do you one better. I'll take you there myself. Come on, let's go. It's getting late. (BALOO HUMMING) <i>Bare necessities</i> <i>Forget about</i> <i>Your worries and your strife</i> <i>I mean the bare necessities</i> What's that? That's a song about the good life. What's a song? (SCOFFS) You never\Nheard a song before? Everyone's got a song. Didn't the wolves ever sing? I don't know. Uh... Oh... We recited the Law of the Jungle. "This is the Law of the Jungle... "as old and as true as the sky. "The Wolf that keeps it may prosper... "but the Wolf that breaks it will die." Kid, that's not a song. That's propaganda. MOWGLI: What's propaganda? (SIGHS) Just a little farther. That's the man village? BALOO: Yep. You can always\Ntell by the Red Flower. They do love their Red Flower. The Red Flower doesn't seem so bad. Yeah. Let it loose, and it destroys\Neverything it touches. Don't ever play with it. You got that? Yeah, I got it. Good. Do you think that's where I'm from? Could be. I don't know, kid. Does it look familiar? I don't remember it. All I remember is living with the wolves. Why do you wanna go there? - Bagheera said I need a people.\N-(BALOO GROANS) Again, with the listening to Bagheera. Hey, he's my friend, okay? Now I don't even know where he is. I can't believe I'm leaving\Nthe Jungle for good. May I say just one thing? What I saw you do today,\NI've never seen anything like it. I've been trying to get\Nthat honey for years. But I used my tricks. What tricks? You know... Everything that I built.\NIt's not the wolf way. Who cares? "The wolf way." That's the Mowgli way. That's the Baloo way. That's our way. That's how we get things done. I can't even imagine what kind\Nof potential you'd have... if you had somebody like me\Nhelping you out. You say you want to go\Nto the man village. I say, you could be a man right here. I'll tell you what. Now you know where the man village is. You can always go down there,\Nwhenever you want. But I would personally appreciate it... as a personal favour to me, personally... if we just worked together,\Njust us, tricks and all. I think it would be interesting to see... just how much honey\Nwe could accumulate... before winter. Whatever I could do to make\Nyour trickiness happen... I will do. And if it turns out to\Nnot be fun for you... I will walk you right down\Nto that man village myself. Is that a deal? Just till winter. Just till winter. (WHISPERING) <i>Ami,</i> wake up. Pups?

And if we're being honest... they're not very smart either. -(ANIMALS GRUNTING)\N- Unlike the mother crocodile, who is a good deal more clever. (SHERE KHAN CHUCKLING) But the one you have to watch out for... is the cuckoo bird. Do you know\Nhow the cuckoo bird survives? By preying on a mother's weakness. The cuckoo bird is too clever\Nto raise its young. Instead, it sneaks... its eggs into the nests of simpler birds. So, when they hatch... the mother bird is fooled. She feeds them, nurtures them. And do you know what happens\Nto her own chicks? They starve... and die... from neglect. All because a mother loved a chick... that wasn't her own. Come now, time for sleep. (PUP WHIMPERING) I think they like me. Why are you doing this? He's gone. Isn't that what you wanted? I want him dead. Once he gets word\Nof what happened here... he'll come back.

I got everything. I have plentiful food... endless treasure... command vast legions. But there's one thing I don't have... and that's the one thing... you can give me. The Red Flower. -(MONKEYS GIBBERING)\N- I don't have that! You're a man, aren't you? That's what makes you a man. You can summon the Red Flower... and control it. They told me not to go near\Nthe Red Flower. You know why they tell you that? Because once you have it,\Nyou rise to the top of the food chain. Nothing in this Jungle can stand up... to the Red Flower.
