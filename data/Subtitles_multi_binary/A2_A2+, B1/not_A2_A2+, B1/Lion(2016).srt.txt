Please could you not do\Nanything while I'm away? Yeah Yeah... that's going to make mum\Nmore unhappy than you already do. Mate... Why do you think I stay away? We see ourselves as United Nations\Nof hospitality schools. And we'd like to think we teach\Na global and balanced perspective. You're here because\Nyou have a dream. We're here to help make\Nthat dream a reality. Yeah and I saw firsthand how\Nthe hospitality industry can really bring infrastructure to\Ncommunities that need it. But I also saw a lot of problems\Nthat they cause, which is why community groups need to\Nbe, involved every step of the way, and they need to be taken seriously. And? I guess I want to help facilitate that\Nand help give them a voice. Saroo. I want to run hotels, so I put\Nall the profits into my pocket. Well, let me ask and start with\Nwhere you are from? Shall we? So, born in Australia? Yeah No, er... Calcutta. I've got family in Calcutta.\NMy cousins are quite... Which part? I'm adopted. I'm not really Indian. But you like cricket though, right?

If you want to eat with your hands, you need to use the naan,\Nlike a spoon. - Use a fork.\N- No, let him use the naan. So how do you say taxi? - Taxi.\N- Taxi. It is the same in every language. Do you want a fork, Saroo? Yeah! He's like my father. - You want another beer?\N- Yes please, thank you. Guddu, I want some jalebi. Guddu, jalebis Hello... You okay? Saroo? I'm not from Calcutta. I'm lost. Howrah station is enormous,\Nyou must have been freaking out. I once went through there\Non a pilgrimage to Puri, and I missed my connection twice. And you didn't speak Bengali? I didn't even know it was called that. - How long were you on the train?\N- A couple of days. A couple of days? Saroo, what was your hometown again? Ganestlay. I must have had it wrong\Nbecause it doesn't exist. But there must be something else\Nthat you do remember. The platform... I fell asleep on,\Nthere's a big rain tank. It was only a few stops\Nfrom Ganestlay. There are thousands of\Nstations with rain tanks. Okay, it was a long time ago. Have you heard of this new\Nprogram, Google Earth? It's incredible, you can find\Nany place from anywhere. Listen to me, we can find out how\Nfast passenger trains went back then. We take that speed, multiply by\Nthe hours that you were on the train. That's it! We create a search radius. And inside there, you will find\Nthe station with the rain tank. Yeah, but it will take a lifetime\Nto search all the stations in India. Did I say all the stations? Ok, even half the stations.. Really guys,\NI don't want to talk about this. Did your parents\Ntry to find you? - What?\N- They tried to find him. No I just mean like, if they tried to find him,\Nmaybe they left like a paper trail. What paper trail? - He didn't know his surname.\N- My mum couldn't read or write. What does she do? A labourer, she carried rocks. Your mum? My mom died about four years ago now. I'm sorry. My dad is still so angry at her. Not for getting sick, obviously... but just for refusing chemo. But she just knew herself, you know?\NShe knew what her terms were and she knew how\Nshe wanted to live, so... Just couldn't accept that, I guess. And how do you feel? I miss her. And what do you think of\NBharat's search radius idea? What was that? Is that your dance?\NIs that how you dance? Oh, God! Hey. You can't keep going on like this. Let me help you. Let's go for a run. What? Lucy! Come here. Hold on. Got a cramp. You lied! You cheat. I never show anybody this. Okay, they're beautiful. I do enjoy it.\NMy little hobby. - Oh wow, look at Mantosh!\N- Uh huh. I'm so glad he's coming tonight. Cheeky little thing. Pure energy. But incredible. So sweet! He's been hard to control, but... very, very smart... and very... I mean, he could do anything if he just\Nlearned to control that energy. He could do it, and do it all. Saroo is very protective of him. I've been blessed. Very blessed. Your mom showed me\Nall your old little trophies. Mum, you didn't. I didn't know you were so athletic. That's only half of them.\NThere's plenty more in the garage. Hey, where you going, mate? Finishing my smoke. I can barely get him off... the couch these days.\N- Lucy! Why can't you just tell them... what you've been up to?\N- Don't! Tell us. They will understand and\Nthey will support you. What? Come on. Hey, um, dinner! Better eat it, while it's hot. - You hungry?\N- Yeah. What? What have I missed? Nothing. - She looks upset.\N- She's not upset! You and I are leaving. Saroo knows everything. - He's an expert.\N- Uh oh! He's a manager. Why are you here? He's here because\Nhe's your brother. No, he's not. - We're different.\N- Hey, now now, Saroo! Saroo... All right. It's all right. Hey hey, no no... It's all right, It's all right...\NStop! Don't move. It's okay. Nice one, mate. It's okay mate, It's okay,\Njust breathe, mate. Just breathe... I hate what he's done to you. I'm sorry. Saroo! Saroo. Saroo! Saroo! Hey! Hey... Kiss me. - Stop, please.\N- Hey! Look at me. Look at me! - Can this wait?\N- Where are you? Can this wait 'til we get home? - Yah?\N- Home? What home? You mean, where I'm alone in one room\Nand you're alone in another room? Come on. Stop, Luce. Stop it. Come on. Please. Saroo! You need to face reality! What do you mean? Reality? You have any idea what it's like\Nknowing my real brother... and mother spend everyday\Nof their lives looking for me? How every day my real\Nbrother screams my name! Can you imagine the pain they\Nmust be in for not knowing where I am? 25 years, Luce.\N25! Why didn't you tell me\Nthat's was happening for you? And we swung about in our... privileged lives. It makes me sick. I have to find home. They need to know, okay? I've never stopped you. I want to help. I can't do this anymore. You deserve more. Don't you do that! Don't you dare do that!\NThis is on you, not on me. Saroo, you there, mate? It's One Day International (cricket)\Ntomorrow. You can come over if you like? I meant to tell you,\NI fixed the tiller. Why don't we take her out?\NWe can head up the coast? Hey, Saroo... Mate, your mum's not, um, look, we've lost track of Mantosh,\Nhe's missing again. You know how worried she gets. We know you quit your job, mate. Just worried about you, son. I've been visiting her. Every night I walk\Nthose streets home. Home from the dam. Home from the station. I know now... every single step of the way. And I imagine that I'm... whispering in her ear... I'm here, it's alright. What was she like? Beautiful. How was New York? It's the same. So, what brings you back? My funding came through. It's great! See... They know how good you are. I miss you. I saw your mom. She's not doing very well. I'm worried, it would kill her\Nif she knew I was searching. You underestimate her. She needs you. No, give me five rupees\Nthen I'll carry them all Okay, you win, take this He was carrying a watermelon\Nand didn't see it coming What? What if you do find home\Nand they're not even there? And you never stop and keep searching? And you don't know what happens over time, things change, and entire worlds change. I don't have a choice. Stay. I can't. Stay right there Weren't you supposed\Nto look after him? Where were you? Don't you love him? John heard Mantosh\Nis out on the boats. Doing a lobster run. He's due back tomorrow. So he'll be flushed with cash,\Nback on the hard stuff. I'm sorry you couldn't have your own kids. What are you saying? We... We... weren't blank pages, were we? Like your own would have been. You weren't just adopting us\Nbut our past as well. - I feel like, we're killing you.\N- I could have had kids. What? We chose not to have kids. We wanted the two of you. That's what we wanted. We wanted the two of you in our lives. That's what we chose. That's one of the reasons,\NI fell in love with your dad. Because we both felt, as if... the world has enough people in it. Have a child, couldn't guarantee\Nit will make anything better. But to take a child that's suffering\Nlike you boys were. Give you a chance in the world. That's something. I bet you never imagined\Nit being this hard. It's not a matter of hard. It's not a mat... There's only one path for me. And, that's how I think. That's how this happened because... When I was 12, I had a vision. Some people would say,\Nit was a breakdown. But it... My dad was an alcoholic.\NYou know that, and he was like he wasn't a good man. He was out of control when I was... I was standing at the back of the house.\NI was looking out across this field. And I just wanted the\Nearth to swallow me up. And I... I felt an electric current,\Nit was like a shock, like a jolt through my whole body. And then I saw... A brown skinned child across that field. And he was standing beside me. And it was right there and I could\Nfeel it so strongly. And for the first time in my\Nlife I felt something good... I felt good. And I knew it was guiding me. And I knew that\NI was going to be fine. It was, as if, that moment I could\Nsee my future, right there! Because I always thought that\NI could keep this family together. And now... Now I don't know. Where... - Mum...\N- What's happening? I don't understand. You don't talk to me any more. I need you, Saroo. Mantosh! Sorry for what I said at dinner. Ganesh Talai... Ganesh Talai. Ganestlay! Mum I found home! What? Please wait for me. I'm here. So this is where you've been. I don't want you to feel,\NI was ungrateful. There wasn't a day,\NI didn't want to tell you. Saroo. I really hope she's there. She needs to see\Nhow beautiful you are! Hey Hi, I used to live here. I... used to... Can I help? That's me. I'm Saroo. I used to live here. - You lived here?\N- Yes I used to live here. I'm looking for Guddu,\NKallu, Shekila. My mother. Come. Come where? Come with me. Just come. Saroo! Mum. Mum? Saroo? Saroo? Saroo... Saroo! Saroo! Oh, how I looked for you! I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Yes, the watermelon. Watermelon Tarabuja!\NYes, Tarabuja! Watermelon... Guddu? And Guddu? Where is Guddu? Where is he? Guddu is no more. He is with God. Shekila. - Shekila\N- Shekila Shekila? Shekila? Shekila? - Shekila?\N- He's your brother! She's so big! It's me, Saroo. Beautiful. Hi, mum. I know you will be sound asleep. I just want to say that I'm safe. I'm safe and the questions\Nhave been answered. There are no more dead-ends. I found my mother, and... she thanks you both for raising me. She understands that\Nyou are my family. She's... happy,\Njust knowing I'm alive. I found her, but that doesn't change\Nwho you are. I love you mum... so much. And you, Dad. And Mantosh. C'mon! Let's go! Come on! Saroo! Let's go! Walk faster! I'm going, I'm going, I'm going!
