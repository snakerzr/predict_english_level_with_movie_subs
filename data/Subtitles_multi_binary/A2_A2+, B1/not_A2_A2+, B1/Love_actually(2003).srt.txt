'Whenever I get gloomy\Nwith the state of the world, 'I think about the arrivals gate\Nat Heathrow airport. 'General opinion makes out\Nthat we live in a world of hatred and greed 'but I don't see that. 'Seems to me that love is everywhere. 'Often it's not particularly dignified\Nor newsworthy but it's always there. 'Fathers and sons, mothers and daughters,\Nhusbands and wives, 'boyfriends, girlfriends, old friends. 'When the planes hit the Twin Towers, 'none of the phone calls from people on\Nboard were messages of hate or revenge, 'they were all messages of love. 'lf you look for it, I've got a sneaky feeling\Nyou'll find that love actually is all around.' I feel it in my fingers I feel it in my toes Feel it in my toes, yeah Love is all around me\NAnd so the... I'm afraid you did it again, Bill. It's just I know the old version\Nso well, you know. Well, we all do. That's why we're making the new version. Right, OK, let's go. I feel it in my fingers\NIn my fingers I feel it in my toes Feel it in my toes, yeah Love is all ar... Oh, fuck, wank, bugger,\Nshitting arsehead and hole. Start again. I feel it in my fingers\NIn my fingers I feel it in my toes Feel it in my toes, yeah Christmas is all around me\NAll around me And so the feeling grows So the feeling grows It's written in the wind\NIn the wind It's everywhere I go Everywhere I go So if you really love Christmas\NLove Christmas Come on and let it snow Come on and let it... This is shit, isn't it? Yep, solid gold shit, maestro. - God, I'm so late.\N- It's just round the corner, you'll make it. You sure you don't mind\Nme going without you? No, really. I'm just feeling so rotten. - I love you.\N- I know. I love you even when you're sick\Nand look disgusting. I know. Now, go or you will actually miss it. Right. - Did I mention that I love you?\N- Yes, you did. Get out, loser. Karen, it's me again. I'm sorry, I literally don't have\Nanybody else to talk to. Absolutely. Horrible moment, though.\NCan I call you back? Of course. Doesn't mean I'm not terribly concerned\Nthat your wife just died. Understood. Er, bugger off, call me later. So what's this big news? We've been given our parts\Nin the nativity play and I'm the lobster. - The lobster?\N- Yeah. - In the nativity play?\N- Yeah. First Lobster. There was more than one lobster present\Nat the birth of Jesus? Duh. Best sandwiches in Britain. Try my lovely nuts? Beautiful muffin for a beautiful lady. Morning, my future wife. OK, you can stop there. Thanks. I need a couple of orange gels. By the way, he introduced me as John\Nbut everyone calls me Jack. Oh, fine. Nice to meet you, Jack. He got me right, though. I'm just Judy. Great, Just Judy! - No surprises?\N- No surprises. - Not like the stag night?\N- Unlike the stag night. - You admit the prostitutes were a mistake?\N- I do. And it would've been much better\Nif they'd not turned out to be men? That is true. Good luck, kiddo. Prime Minister, over here! Thank you. - Welcome, Prime Minister.\N- Woh! I must work on my wave. How are you? - How are you feeling?\N- Erm... Cool. Powerful. Would you like to meet\Nyour household staff? Yes, I would like that very much indeed. Anything to put off\Nactually running the country. - This is Terence. He's in charge.\N- Morning, sir. Good morning.\NI had an uncle called Terence. Hated him, I think he was a pervert.\NBut I very much like the look of you. - This is Pat.\N- Hello, Pat. Good morning, sir. I'm the housekeeper. Oh, right. I should be easier than the last lot. No nappies, no teenagers, no scary wife. And this is Natalie. She's new, like you. - Hello, Natalie.\N- Hello, David. I mean, sir. Shit, I can't believe I've just said that. And now I've gone and said "shit".\NTwice. I'm so sorry, sir. You could've said "fuck"\Nand we'd have been in real trouble. Thank you, sir. I had a premonition\NI was gonna fuck up on my first day. Oh, piss it! Right, I'll get my things\Nand then let's fix the country, shall we? Yeah, I can't see why not. - It's all right.\N- Did you see what I did? - Yes, I did.\N- I just went "blurh". - Hello there.\N- I'm right over here. Yeah, I'm in here. OK. Good. Thank you. Ah. Oh, no. That is so inconvenient. In the presence of God,\NPeter and Juliet have given their consent and made their marriage vows\Nto each other. They've declared their marriage\Nby the giving of rings. I therefore proclaim\Nthat they are husband and wife. And you resisted\Nthe temptation for surprises. Yeah, I'm mature now. Love, love, love Love, love, love - Love, love, love...\N- Did you do this? Er, no. Love, love, love, love There's nothing you can do\Nthat can't be done Oh, it... There's nothing you can sing\Nthat can't be sung There's nothing you can say\Nbut you can learn how to play the game It's easy All you need is love All you need is love All you need is love, love Love is all you need... Look, it's Pikey. Hello! What the hell are you doing here? Oh, I just popped over\Nto borrow some old CDs. - The lady of the house let you in, did she?\N- Yeah. - Lovely, obliging girl.\N- Yeah. I thought I'd pop back and see\Nif she's better. This is good. - Oh.\N- Listen, erm, I've been thinking. I think we ought to take Mum out for\Nher birthday on Friday. What do you think? - I just feel we've been bad sons this year.\N- Sounds fine. A bit boring but fine. Hurry up, big boy! I'm naked and I want you at least twice\Nbefore Jamie gets home. I am so happy to see you! - Delicious delicacy?\N- Er, no, thanks. Taste explosion? - Food?\N- No, thanks. Yeah, a bit dodgy, isn't it? Looks like a dead baby's finger. Oooh. Oh. Tastes like it, too. I'm Colin, by the way. - I'm Nancy.\N- Wicked. - What do you do, Nancy?\N- I'm a cook. - Ever do weddings?\N- Yes, I do. - They should've asked you to do this one.\N- They did. - God, I wish you hadn't have turned it down.\N- I didn't. Right. - I've worked out why I can't find true love.\N- Why is that? English girls. They're stuck up, you see. And I am primarily attractive to girls\Nwho are cooler, game for a laugh. Like American girls.\NSo I should just go to America! I'd get a girlfriend there instantly.\NWhat do you think? I think it's crap, Colin. That's where you're wrong. American girls would dig me\Nwith my cute British accent. - You don't have a cute British accent.\N- Yes, I do! I'm going to America. Colin, you're a Ionely, ugly arsehole.\NAccept it. Never. I am Colin, God of Sex.\NI'm just on the wrong continent, that's all. Bit of quiet\Nwhile we finish the lighting, guys! - The traffic today was just...\N- Unbelievable. Judy, could you take the top off this time? Lighting need to know when we're gonna\Nsee the, erm, nipples and when we're not. Yes, OK. Right.\NAt least it's nice and warm in here. Not always the case, is it? I was standing in for Brad Pitt once\Non Seven Years In Tibet... - Yes, yeah.\N- Bloody freezing... Guys, time's tight\Nand we have to get the actors in. - Fine.\N- I promise I won't look. Right, let's have\Nanother look at that, please. Can you just put your hands on her breasts? - OK, yeah. Is that all right?\N- Yes. I'll warm them up! - And massage them, please.\N- Right. It's junction 13 that's just murder, isn't it?\NTotal gridlock this morning. Jo and I had a lot of time\Nto prepare for this moment. Some of her requests, for instance, that I should bring\NClaudia Schiffer as my date to the funeral, I was confident she expected me to ignore. But others she was pretty damn clear about. When she first mentioned\Nwhat's about to happen, I said, "Over my dead body." And she said, "No, Daniel, over mine." And as usual, my darling girl... and Sam's darling mum was right. So she's going to say her final farewell\Nto you not through me but, inevitably, ever so coolly, through the immortal genius\Nof the Bay City Rollers. Bye bye baby, baby goodbye Goodbye baby, baby bye bye Bye bye baby Don't make me cry\NGoodbye baby, baby bye bye You're the one girl in town I'd marry Girl I'd marry you now if I were free I wish it could be I could love you but why begin it? Cos there ain't any future in it She's got me but I'm not free so... Bye bye baby, baby goodbye Goodbye baby, baby bye bye Bye bye baby, don't make me cry Goodbye baby, baby bye bye Wish I never had known you... Do you love him? Er, er, what? No, l-I just thought I'd ask bluntly\Nin case it was the right question and you needed someone to talk to about it\Nand no one had ever asked you. No. No. No is the answer. Absolutely not. ...on my finger... So that's a no, then? Yes. Erm... Bye bye baby, baby goodbye Goodbye baby, baby bye bye... This DJ, what do you reckon? - The worst in history?\N- Probably. I think it all hangs on the next song. Now here's one for the lovers. That's quite a few of you,\NI shouldn't be surprised and a half. And they called it... - He's done it, it's official.\N- Worst DJ in the world. Oh, I guess they'll never know... Sarah's waiting for you. Oh, yes, of course, erm... Great, er, good, good. How are you doing, Mia?\NSettling in fine? Learning who to avoid? Absolutely. - Harry?\N- Sarah, switch off your phone and tell me exactly\Nhow long it is that you've been working here. Two years, seven months, three days and, I suppose, what, two hours? And how long have you been in love\Nwith Karl, our enigmatic chief designer? Um... Two years, seven months, three days\Nand, I suppose, an hour and 30 minutes. Thought as much. - Do you think everybody knows?\N- Yes. - Do you think Karl knows?\N- Yes. Oh, that is... that is bad news. I just thought that maybe the time\Nhad come to do something about it. - Like what?\N- Invite him out for a drink then casually mention you'd like to marry\Nhim and have lots of sex and babies. - You know that?\N- Yes. And so does Karl. Think about it, for all our sakes. It's Christmas. Certainly. Excellent. Will do. Thanks, boss. - Hi, Sarah.\N- Hi, Karl. Babe. Absolutely, fire away. Mia, Mia, would you turn that down? What is that? That was the Christmas effort\Nfrom the once great Billy Mack. Oh, dear me, how are the mighty fallen. I can safely say that is the worst record\NI've heard this century... Oh, and coincidentally,\NI believe Billy will be a guest on my friend Mike's show\Nin a few minutes' time. Welcome back, Bill. Billy, welcome back to the airwaves. New Christmas single,\Ncover of Love Is All Around. Except we've changed\Nthe word "love" to "Christmas". Yes, is that an important message\Nto you, Bill? Not really, Mike. Christmas is a time for people\Nwith someone they love in their lives. - And that's not you?\N- That's not me, Michael. When I was young and successful,\NI was greedy and foolish and now I'm left with no one,\Nwrinkled and alone. - Wow. Thanks for that, Bill.\N- For what? For actually giving\Na real answer to a question. It doesn't often happen here\Nat Radio Watford, I can tell you. - Ask me anything, I'll tell you the truth.\N- Best shag you ever had? - Britney Spears.\N- Wow. No, only kidding! - She was rubbish.\N- OK, here's one. How do you think the new record\Ncompares to your old, classic stuff? Come on, Mikey, you know as well as I do\Nthe record's crap. But wouldn't it be great\Nif number one this Christmas wasn't some smug teenager but an old ex-heroin addict\Nsearching for a comeback at any price? Those young popsters come Christmas\Nwill be stretched out naked with a cute bird balancing on their balls and I'll be stuck in some dingy flat\Nwith me manager Joe, ugliest man in the world, fucking miserable because\Nour fucking gamble didn't pay off. So if you believe in Father Christmas,\Nchildren, like your Uncle Billy does, buy my festering turd of a record. And particularly enjoy\Nthe incredible crassness of the moment we try to squeeze\Nan extra syllable into the fourth line. I think you're referring to "If you really love Christmas..." "Come on and let it snow." Ouch. So, here it is one more time, the dark horse for this year's\NChristmas number one, Christmas Is All Around.\NThank you, Billy. After this, the news. Is the new prime minister in trouble already? I feel it in my fingers\NI feel it in my toes - OK. What's next?\N- The President's visit. Ah, yes, yes. I fear this is going to be\Na difficult one to play. Alex. There's a strong feeling in the party\Nwe mustn't allow ourselves to be bullied - like the last government.\N-  Here, here. This is our first really important test,\Nlet's take a stand. Right. Right. I understand that\Nbut I have decided... not to. Not this time. Let's not forget that America\Nis the most powerful country in the world. I'm not going to act like a petulant child. Who do you have to screw round here\Nto get a cup of tea and a biscuit? Right. Yeah, come in. - These are from the Treasury...\N- Uh-huh. ...and these are for you. Excellent. Thanks a lot. I was hoping you'd win, not that\NI wouldn't have been nice to the other bloke, just always given him the boring biscuits\Nwith no chocolate. Thanks very much. Thanks... Natalie. God, come on, get a grip.\NYou're the Prime Minister, for God's sake. So what do you reckon\Nto our new prime minister? Oh, I like him. I can't understand\Nwhy he's not married, though. You know the type, he's married to his job. Either that or gay as a picnic basket. Excuse me, Judy, if you could\Njust lower the nipples - and cheat them a bit to the left?\N- OK. I have to say, Judy, this is a real pleasure, it's lovely to find someone\NI can actually chat to. - Thank you!\N- Oh, well, you know. - And ditto.\N- Thank you. The move again, please, Judy. - Ooh, sorry.\N- Oh, God, sorry. You all right? - Exciting news!\N- What? I've bought a ticket to the States.\NI'm off in three weeks. - No.\N- Yes! - To a fantastic place called Wisconsin.\N- No! Yes! Wisconsin babes,\Nhere comes Sir Colin! No, Col! There are a few babes in America,\NI grant you, but they're going out\Nwith rich, attractive guys. Tone, you're just jealous. You know perfectly well\Nthat any bar anywhere in America contains ten girls more beautiful\Nand more likely to have sex with me - than the whole of the United Kingdom.\N- That is total bollocks. You're mad. No, I'm wise. Stateside I am Prince William\Nwithout the weird family. - No, Colin, no!\N- Yes! - Nyet!\N- Da! - Nein!\N- Ja, darling! Right, the Christmas party,\Nnot my favourite night of the year and your unhappy job to organise. - Tell me.\N- It's basic, really. Find a venue, over-order on the drinks,\Nbulk buy the guacamole and advise the girls to avoid Kevin\Nif they want their breasts unfondled. - Wives and family and stuff?\N- Yeah. I mean, not children. But their wives and girlfriends, et cetera. Oh, Christ, you haven't got some horrible\Nsix-foot, tight-T-shirt-wearing boyfriend? No. I'll just be hanging around the mistletoe,\Nhoping to be kissed. Really? Right. He now spends all the time in his room.\NI mean, he'll be up there now. - That's not unusual. My horrid son...\N- Bernard? Bernard. Stays in his room all the time.\NThank goodness. Yeah, but Karen, this is all the time. I'm afraid that there's something\Nreally wrong, you know? I mean, clearly it's about his mum but Christ, he might be injecting heroin\Ninto his eyeballs for all I know. At the age of 11? Well, maybe not his eyeballs, then.\NMaybe just his veins. The problem is his mum\Nalways used to talk to him, you know, and... I don't know, this whole stepfather thing\Nseems suddenly to somehow matter like it never did before. Listen, it was always going to be\Na totally shit time. Just be patient. And maybe check the room for needles. And then when he sometimes does\Ncome out, it's obvious he's been crying. It's just such a ridiculous waste. And now if it's going to ruin\NSam's life as well... I just don't know. Get a grip. People hate sissies. No one's ever gonna shag you\Nif you cry all the time. Yeah. Absolutely. Helpful. So, what's the problem, Samuel? Is it just Mum or is it something else, huh? Maybe school? Are you being bullied? Or is it something worse? Can you give me any clues at all? - You really want to know?\N- I really want to know. Even though you won't be able to help? Even if that's the case, yeah. OK. Well... truth is, actually... I'm in love. Sorry? I know I should be thinking\Nabout Mum and I am but I'm in love. I was before she died\Nand there's nothing I can do about it. - Aren't you a bit young to be in love?\N- No. Ah, well. OK, well... I'm a little relieved. - Why?\N- Because I... thought it'd be something worse. Worse than the total agony of being in love? Er... No, you're right. Total agony. - Night, Sarah.\N- Night, Karl. Yeah, absolutely. Free as a bird. Fire away. Alone again. Naturally. - I'll deal with it.\N- Mm. - Ah. Natalie.\N- Sir. Thanks. Natalie. Erm, I'm starting to feel... uncomfortable about us\Nworking so closely every day and me knowing so little about you,\Nit seems elitist and wrong. Well, there's not much to know. Well, erm, where do you live, for instance? Wandsworth. The dodgy end. - Ah, my sister lives in Wandsworth.\N- Oh. So which exactly is the dodgy end? At the end of the high street,\NHarris Street, near the Queen's Head. - Oh, yeah, yeah, that is dodgy.\N- Hm. Erm, and you live\Nwith your husband? Boyfriend? - Three illegitimate but charming children?\N- No. I've just split up with my boyfriend, so\NI'm back with my mum and dad for a while. - Ah. Sorry.\N- No, it's fine. I'm well shot of him. - He said I was getting fat.\N- I beg your pardon? He said no one'd fancy a girl\Nwith thighs the size of tree trunks. Not a nice guy, actually, in the end. No. You know, erm... being Prime Minister,\NI could just have him murdered. Thank you, sir. I'll think about it. Do. The SAS are absolutely charming. Ruthless, trained killers\Nare just a phone call away. Oh, God. Did you have this kind of problem? Yeah, course you did, you saucy minx. So, let's go. We can definitely crack this. Remember, I was a kid once, too. So, come on, it's someone at school. Right? - Yeah.\N- Uh-huh. Good, good. And what does she, he, feel about you? SHE doesn't even know my name. And even if she did, she'd despise me. She's the coolest girl in school. And everyone worships her\Nbecause she's heaven. Good. Good. Well, basically you're fucked, aren't you? Hi there and welcome back. So, three weeks till Christmas, looks like\Nthe real competition is gonna be Blue. I saw them on the show last week.\NThey weren't very nice about my record. No. Little scamps. But very, very talented musicians. Yeah. I understand you've got a prize\Nfor our competition winners. Yes, I have, Ant or Dec. It's a personalised felt-tip pen. Oh, great. It's brilliant. It even writes on glass, so if you've got a framed picture,\Nlike, for instance, this one of Blue, you can just write on it. - Er, a lot of kids watching, Billy.\N-  Oh, yeah. Hiya, kids. Here's an important message\Nfrom your Uncle Bill - don't buy drugs. Become a pop star\Nand they give you them for free. And I do believe it's a commercial break.\NWe'll see you soon. Bye-bye. All I want for Christmas is you - Look at him! Eurh!\N- Just a minute. Actually, they're not funny. They're art. OK, let's say, er, Thursday, my place. Great. I've got Juliet on the other line,\Nshe wants to ask you a favour. - OK, fine.\N- Thanks and, er, be nice. - I'm always nice.\N- 'You know what I mean, Marky, be friendly.' - I'm always...\N-  'Mark? ' Hi. How was the honeymoon? It was great.\NThanks for the gorgeous sendoff. - So, what can I do for you?\N- 'It's only a tiny favour.' I've just tried the wedding video\Nand it's a disaster. - 'It's come out all blue and wibbly.'\N- I'm sorry. I remember you filming a lot\Nand I wondered if I could look at it. To be honest, I didn't really... Please. All I want is one shot of me\Nin a wedding dress that isn't turquoise. I'll have a look but I'm pretty sure I wiped it,\Nso don't get any hopes up. 'Must go.' Any progress with our matchmaking plans? No. I've done fuck-all and never will\Nbecause he's too good for me. How true. Stop. And of course, your mobile goes. Hello. Hi. How you doing? - So, how's the Christmas party going?\N- Good. Think I've found a venue. - What's it like?\N- Good. Good. It's an art gallery. Full of dark corners\Nfor doing dark deeds. Oh. Right. Good. Well, I suppose I should\Ntake a look at it or something. You should. Ah, bonjour, Eleonore. Bonjour, Monsieur Bennett. Welcome back. And this year you bring a lady guest? No. There's a change of situation. Just me. - Oh. Am I sad or not sad?\N- I think you're not surprised. - And you stay here till Christmas?\N- Yeah, yeah. Good. Well, I find you\Na perfect lady to clean the house. This is Aurelia. Ah. - Er, bonjour, Aurelia.\N- Bonjour. Er, je suis, er, très heureux\Nde vous avoir ici. Unfortunately, she cannot speak French,\Njust like you. She's Portuguese. Ah, ah, buongiorno. Eusebio, er, er... Er, molto bueno... I think she's ten years too young\Nto remember a footballer called Eusebio. And "molto bueno" is Spanish. Right. Anyway, it's nice to meet you and... Can you drive her home after her work? Oh, absolutely, yes.\NCon-Con grande, er, pl-plesura. Which is what? Turkish? Bello. Er, bella. Er, mon-montagno, arvarez... No, right. Silence is golden. As the Tremeloes said. Clever guys, although I think the original version was\Nby Frankie Valli And The Four Seasons. Gr-great band. Silence Is Golden) Oh, shut up. Mr President! - Over here, sir!\N- What will you be talking about? Mr President, welcome. It's a pleasure to meet you. Come through.\NI'm sorry your wife couldn't make it. So is she. Although she would have been\Nkind of Ionely. Yes. Pathetic, isn't it? Just never been able to tie a girl down. Not sure that politics and dating go together. Really? I've never found that. Yeah, you're still sickeningly handsome,\Nwhereas I look like my Aunt Mildred. - Very jealous of your plane, by the way.\N- Thank you. We love that thing. Ah, Natalie. Hi. Morning, ma'am. How's your day so far? Excellent. My goodness,\Nthat's a pretty little son of a bitch. Did you see those pipes? Yeah, she's terrific. At her job. No, absolutely not. We cannot\Nand will not consult on that either. That is unexpected. Well, it shouldn't be. The last administration\Nmade it perfectly clear. We're being consistent with their policies. With all respect, they were bad policies. Thanks, Alex. I don't think\Nwe're making progress here. Let's, erm... move on, shall we? Well, now, that was an interesting day. Sorry if our line was firm but there's\Nno point in tiptoeing around today, then just disappointing you for four years. I have plans and I plan to see them through. Absolutely.\NThere is one final thing to look at. It's very close to my heart.\NJust give me a second. I'll give you anything you ask for. As long as it's not something\NI don't wanna give. Hi. Pathetic. It's great Scotch. I'II, erm... I'll be going, then. Er, Natalie, I hope to see much more of you\Nas our countries work toward a better future. Thank you, sir. Er, yes, Peter. Mr President, has it been a good visit? Very satisfactory indeed. We got what we came for and our special relationship\Nis still very special. Prime Minister? I love that word "relationship".\NCovers all manner of sins, doesn't it? I fear that this has become\Na bad relationship. A relationship based on\Nthe President taking what he wants and casually ignoring all those things\Nthat really matter to, erm... Britain. We may be a small country\Nbut we're a great one, too. The country of Shakespeare,\NChurchill, the Beatles, Sean Connery, Harry Potter. David Beckham's right foot. David Beckham's left foot, come to that. And a friend who bullies us\Nis no longer a friend. And since bullies only respond to strength,\Nfrom now onward, I will be prepared to be much stronger. And the President\Nshould be prepared for that. Mr President! Joe. It's your sister on line four. All right. Er, yes, I'm very busy\Nand important, how can I help you? Have you gone completely insane? - You can't always be sensible.\N- 'You can if you're Prime Minister.' - It's the Chancellor on the other line.\N- It isn't! - 'I'll call you back.'\N- No, you won't! The trouble with being the Prime Minister's\Nsister is it puts your life into perspective. What did my brother do today?\NHe fought for his country. What did I do?\NI made a papier-mâché lobster head. What is this we're listening to? Joni Mitchell. I can't believe you still listen to Joni Mitchell. I love her and true love lasts a lifetime. Joni Mitchell is the woman who taught\Nyour cold English wife how to feel. Did she? Oh, well, that's good,\NI must write to her and say thanks. Which doll for Daisy's friend Emily? The one that looks like a transvestite\Nor the one that looks like a dominatrix? 'It's almost enough\Nto make you feel patriotic, 'so here's one\Nfor our arse-kicking prime minister. 'A golden oldie for a golden oldie.' Hold me I'll give you all that you need Wrap your love around me You're so excited\NI can feel you getting hotter Oh baby I'll take you down, I'll take you down Where no one's ever gone before And if you want more If you want more, more, more Jump for my love Jump in And feel my touch Jump, if you wanna taste\Nmy kisses in the night then Jump for my love I'll take you down, I'll take you down Where no one's ever gone Yeah, erm, Mary, can we move the Japanese\Nambassador to four o'clock tomorrow? - Certainly, sir.\N- Terrific. Thanks so much. Erm. Would you like the last, er...? Thank you very much but no. If you saw my sister, you'd understand why. That's all right, more for me. Just don't go eating it all yourself, you're getting chubbier every day. I'm very lucky I've got a constitution\Nwhere I never put on weight. Hello. Oop. Sorry. Hello? - Thank you.\N-  Não! - Eu peço imensa desculpa.\N- Oh, no. Hold on. - God, it's half the book. Oh, no.\N- Que desastre. Just leave them, please!\NThey're not important. They're not worth it! Stop! Stop. Aa-ahh. It's all just rubbish. Just leave it. Oh, God, she's in. And now she'll think I'm a total spaz\Nif I don't go in too. Fuck - it's cold! Fuck - it's freezing! Fuck! This stuff better be good. It's not worth it,\Nthis isn't bloody Shakespeare. I don't want to drown saving some shit my grandmother\Ncould have written. Just stop. Stop. What kind of idiot\Ndoesn't make copies? I really must do copies. There'd better not be eels in here. Try not to disturb the eels. Oh, what the hell is that? Thank you. Thank you so much. I know. I'll name\None of the characters after you. Maybe you could name\None of the characters after me. Or give me 50% of the profits. Or I could give you 5% of the profits. What kind of book is it? - Romance?\N- Yes. It's, erm... Ah, er... Thriller... crime... - Sim.\N-  Crime. Crime, murder. Frightening? Er, scary? Yes, sometimes scary. And, er, sometimes not.\NMainly scary how bad the writing is. Mm. I'd better get back to work. - Ah.\N-  Later you'll drive me home? Sure. It's my favourite time of day... driving you. It's the saddest part\Nof my day, leaving you. Sorry. 'And coming up\Nlater this morning, it's this guy... ' There's no beginning, there'll be no end - Cos on Christmas...\N- '... the bad grandad of rock'n'roll, 'here at 10:30. Do not switch off.' Banoffee pie? No, thanks. Thank God.
