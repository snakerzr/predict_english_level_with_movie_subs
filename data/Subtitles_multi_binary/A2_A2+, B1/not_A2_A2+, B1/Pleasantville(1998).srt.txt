BETTY:\NWhat's that, Bud? First place in the science fair. There were lots of swell projects. I guess mine was just the swellest. Darling, that's wonderful,\Nexcept there's no such word as "swellest." Well, gee whiz, Mom,\Nit wasn't the English fair. [BETTY CHUCKLES]\N[AUDIENCE LAUGHING] No, that's not the point. The point is,\Nyou're supposed to see them. Fine, fine, fine. See them another time. "What's a mother to do?" What's a mother to do? [AUDIENCE LAUGHING]\N[THEME MUSIC PLAYING] [BELL RINGS] HOWARD: Okay, in the very first\NPleasantville episode... ...whose window did Bud break when\Nhe was playing with his father's golf clubs?

Why did their parents come home early\Nfrom their weekend at the lake? Because Bud didn't answer the phone,\Nand they were worried about him. Man, you're unbelievable. You'll win this thing for sure.\NWhen is it on? Marathon starts at 6:30.\NContest is tomorrow at noon. Thousand bucks, huh?\NAnd it's on all night? Well, of course it is, Howard.\NThat's why they call it a marathon. GIRL:\NOh, my God, he is, like, so pathetic. I can't believe you're, like,\Nrelated to him. Only on my parents' side.

I don't know. I'm thinking about\Nthat red thing I got at the mall. It's not slutty. It's fun. Well, hello,\Nhe's not coming over to study. Yeah, I know. Well, sometimes I'm jealous of you too. He's not homeless, Howard.\NThey just don't say where he lives. [CAR TRUNK OPENS] Well, it's a silly question. Because nobody's homeless\Nin Pleasantville. Because that's just not what it's like.

Do you think you could do this soon? - It's almost 6:30.\N- What's the hurry? Pleasantville marathon starts at 6:30. [THUNDER CRASHES] Pleasantville? Gosh, I love that show.\NWatched it for years. That's not the reason.\NI've got a date at 6:30. Who did Muffin take\Nto the masquerade ball... ...when her date came down\Nwith the measles? - Her father.\N- That's right. - And how'd she dress him?\N- As Prince Charming. Nice.

[YELPS] Look at me. I'm pasty. Psst. Over here. Told you it was your lucky day. I bet you thought\NI was just a fan or something. - What happened?\N- A miracle.

Well, wouldn't you?\NYou look for someone for years. You pour your heart into it. This is a privilege, you know. I don't think I better\Ntalk about this now. Where are you going?

Here, kitty, kitty, kitty. Here, kitty. Oh, God. We are. We're, like, stuck in Nerdville. [CAT MEOWS] I knew you'd pay a price for this. I knew\Nyou couldn't be so hopelessly geek-ridden... ...for so long without suffering\Nsome really tragic consequences. But it's just not fair. I was getting really popular. And Debbie Russell had transferred\Nto another school. And my skin was really great\Nsince March. Mark Davis was finally starting\Nto come around. BOY:\NHello, Mary Sue. What's all the commotion?\NWhere's the cat? Um... It's... [CAT MEOWING] Oh. Right. I'll see you at school, Mary Sue. Who's that? DAVID:\NSkip Martin, captain of the basketball team. Does he like me?

[BELL RINGS] DAVID: I thought you liked him.\N- Yeah, but I don't know. One date, Jen. Please.\NThat's all I'm asking. If you don't go out with this guy,\Nwe could throw their universe out of whack.

Oh, wait. Look at this. Know why the firemen\Nonly rescue cats out of trees? - Nothing burns around here.\N- Jen, stop. They don't even need firemen.\NI could really use a cigarette too. Jen, listen.

You really think anybody's gonna notice if\NI don't have a chocolate malt with this guy? [GIRLS GIGGLING] PEGGY JANE:\NYou won't believe what we heard. Skip Martin is gonna ask you out. - And that's not all.\NPEGGY JANE: No, that's not all. He's gonna give you his pin. [GIGGLING] JENNIFER:\NAre you sure I'm supposed to wear this? I could kill a guy with these things. It's in your closet. I've worn kinky stuff before... - He won't notice anyway.\N- Why not?

And you always seemed\Nso smart and everything. Like that report you did\Non our town hall. Gosh. I didn't know\Nwhat I'd talk to you about. Yeah. Well, sometimes\Ntalking's overrated. Don't you think? Huh? [CHUCKLES] Oh, right. So I know I haven't been steady\Nwith anybody or anything... ...but I just don't wanna rush it. I mean, there's kids\Nthat are holding hands already... ...but I figure there's plenty of time\Nfor that kind of thing later on, don't you? Yeah. Can you excuse me\Nfor just a second? [SIGHS] God.

That's silly, Mary Sue.\NHow could you possibly pin me? [PANTING] [GROANS] Bud? Son, what's wrong? Have you seen Mary Sue? Why, no. She's still on her date with Skip.\NIs something the matter? No. No. I was just worried about her. Bud, your sister's getting older now... ...and she'll naturally\Nbe going out with boys. But she's a fine young woman.

I think I might be ill. Something's happening to me. That's supposed to happen. It is? Yeah. Trust me. BETTY:\NDo you want some more cookies? No, thanks. I'm fine.

No, it's not like\Nyou think it's funny or dorky. You, like, really like it. No. You have it all wrong. I am mortified to be your sister. You have no right to do this to them.

Look at that. TOMMY:\NWow. What happened to your gum? I gotta go. I'm gonna meet Skip at the flagpole. [CROWD CHEERING] [CHATTERING] DR. HENDERSON:\NMm-hm. Hm. Well, I don't think\Nit's anything to worry about. You cut down on greasy foods\Nand chocolate. You know, things like that. It'll probably just clear up on its own.

No, I know. I know I do.\NBut it's always the same, you know? Grill the bun, flip the meat, melt the cheese.\NNever changes. - It never gets any better or worse.\N- Okay, just listen for a sec. The night when I closed by myself\Nwas different. Oh, forget about that. Oh, okay. I really liked it, though. Come here. Look. You can't always like what you do. Sometimes you just gotta do it\Nbecause it's your job. And even if you don't like it,\Nyou just gotta do it anyway. - Why?\N- So they can have their hamburgers. - Oh.\N- I'm sorry. You know what I really like? - What's that?\N- Christmastime. See, every year, on December 3rd... ...I get to paint Christmas decorations\Non the window... ...and every year I get to paint\Na different thing. Here, I'll show you. [MR. JOHNSON CHUCKLES] Wow. That's pretty good. Thanks. But this morning\NI was thinking... ...and I realized that\NI look forward to it all year. I thought, "That seems awfully silly. It seems like an awfully long time\Nto be waiting for just one moment." Don't you think? Well, don't you? I think that you should try not\Nto think about that anymore. Okay. I'll try that, then. - Morning, Jim.\N- How are you? Awfully nice. Have they ever lost before? Basketball? No, they sure haven't. It just feels wrong, that's all. Maybe that's where\Nthey get that saying: "Can't win them all." That's a good point, Ralph.\NThey do have that saying. But they do win them all.\NThey've always won them all. Oh, Mr. Mayor. Here. Here. Go ahead. Oh, don't be silly, Roy.\NI couldn't possibly take your spot. What I wanna know is,\Nif they've never lost before... ...and they've never tied before,\Nisn't that what you call winning them all? - He's right. That's what you call it.\NBIG BOB: Yeah. - They have called it that.\N- That's true. He said it would clear up\Non its own... ...if she just stayed away\Nfrom fried foods and sweets. [WOMEN CHUCKLE] Except it's spread to her lips now too. Oh, I don't know. MARY:\NAnd you say it was just red? MARGE:\NWell, you know, like real red. WOMAN:\NI know what you mean. That's like this car that was in front\Nof Bill Johnson's soda shop. I was going by it the other day,\Nand it looked green. Real green. MARGE: Have you seen him lately?\NI was getting my sewing machine fixed... ...and he was sitting in the window\Nof his shop just staring. MARY:\NThat is strange. It's your bid, Betty. - Mary Sue.\N- Yeah? What goes on up at Lovers' Lane? What do you mean? Well, you hear these things lately. Kids spending so much time up there. Is it holding hands? That kind of thing? - Yeah.\N- Hm. That and... What? It doesn't matter. No. I wanna know. Well... [WHISPERS]\N...sex. Ohh. What's sex? - You sure you wanna know this?\N- Yes. Okay. Well... You see, Mom... ...when two people really love\Neach other very, very much... ...and they wanna share that\Nwith each other... ...that's what it's like to have sex. Are you okay? Yes. It's just that... ...your father would never do\Nanything like that. Ohh. Hmm. Well, you know, Mom... ...there are other ways\Nto enjoy yourself... ...without Dad. Ahh. Sweetie, you coming to bed?

[PEOPLE WHISPERING INDISTINCTLY] - Hey.\N- Hey. What's going on? I'm not sure.\NThey wanna ask you a question. - I didn't really know how to handle it, so...\N- Okay. [WHISPERS INDISTINCTLY] Hi, Bud. - How you doing?\NGIRLS: Hi, Bud. You wanted to ask me something? How'd you know about the fire? What? How'd you know\Nhow to put it out and all? Oh. Well, where I used to live,\Nthat's just what firemen did. [PEOPLE MURMURING] And where's that? Um... Outside of Pleasantville. [PEOPLE MURMURING] Well, what's outside of Pleasantville? It doesn't matter. It's not important. What's outside of Pleasantville? There are some places... ...that the road doesn't go\Nin a circle. There are some places\Nwhere the road keeps going. Keeps going? Yeah. Yeah, it just keeps going.\NIt all keeps going. Roads and rivers and... Like the mighty Mississippi? What? I thought the books were blank. They were. Okay. This was not my fault. They asked what it was about. I didn't remember,\Nbecause I read it back in 10th grade. When I told them what I did remember,\Nthat's when the pages filled in. - The pages filled in?\N- Mm-hm. But only up until the part with the raft,\Nbecause that's as far as I read. Do you know how it ends? - Yeah, I do.\N- So how does it end? Well, okay. Let's see. They were running away. Huck and the slave. They were going up the river,\Ntrying to get free. And, in trying to get free... ...they see that\Nthey're sort of free already. Oh, my God. Wow. Hey, what about this one? Oh, yeah. Yeah. This is great. This is... This kid Holden Caulfield,\Nhe's a really lonely kid. He gets kicked out of boarding school. And then... Sheesh. Look at them. Spreading all over the place. Look at her books. ROY:\NLook at her sweater. I mean, going up to that lake\Nall the time is one thing... ...but now they're going\Nto a library? What's next? RALPH:\NYou're right. Somebody ought\Nto do something about that. Soon. George, you're probably wondering\Nwhy I asked to stop by and see you today. I'm sure you've noticed\Nthe same things we all have. Certain changes in the town. You know what I mean by changes? Changes. Yeah, changes. And I'm not just talking\Nabout big stuff like the fire. It's the little things.\NYou hear about Bill Miller? No. What? Wife wants him\Nto get one of those new beds. - One of those big beds?\N- Yeah. Oh, my gosh. What's he gonna do? I don't know. I mean, it's everywhere. Bill Anderson's boy\Njust quit his job at the market. What do you mean, quit? Took his apron off in the middle of an order,\Nsaid, "I don't feel like it anymore." Groceries all over the counter. Ha-ha-ha. Took them three hours\Njust to sort it out. - Sheesh.\N- Yeah. Everybody really likes you, George. - Oh, well...\N- No, they do. Not just because you're a good bowler.\NPeople respect you. Well, thank you. It's important for them to see\Nsomeone they respect... ...stand up for what's right. If you love a place,\Nyou can't just sit back... ...and watch this kind of thing\Nhappen, now, can you? No, of course not. That is why I want you to be a member\Nof the Pleasantville Chamber of Commerce. Oh, my gosh. Oh! I hardly know what to say. [LAUGHING] It's just like yours. Well, it is exactly like mine, George. [BIG BOB LAUGHING] - Ohh.\N- Huh. Well, you can start by saying yes. - Yes.\N- And by getting me... ...one of those swell pineapple kabobs.\N- Well, sure. You bet. Betty, Bob wants to try\Nsome of your great hors d'oeuvres. Betty? Bett? I'll get her. Are you okay? You all right? What am I going to do? I can't go out there this way. How can I go out there this way? Look at me. It's okay. It's all right. GEORGE:\NBetty? Have you got any makeup? In my handbag. GEORGE:\NHoney, where are you? Here. Give me your cheek. Here. Give me the other. There. That's good. Now lift your chin up. - Is it working?\N- Yes. Here, look at me. BETTY:\NWhat? Does it look okay? Yeah. It looks just like it did. And... And they won't be able to tell? No. No, they won't be able to tell. GEORGE:\NBetty, are you in there? BETTY:\NComing, sweetie. - Oh, hi.\N- Hi. Aren't you a little bit early? I brought you something\Nfrom the library. It's an art book. Oh, my gosh, Bud. I just thought, since you like to paint,\Nit might help to... Gee whiz. Who is Titian? I'm not sure. It's beautiful, Bud. What's wrong? Oh, it's... I'll never be able to do that. Well, you just started.\NI mean, you can't do it now. No, no, no. That's not it. Just where am I gonna see\Ncolors like that? Must be awful lucky\Nto see colors like that. I'll bet they don't know\Nhow lucky they are. - Hi.\N- Hi. - How are you doing?\N- Swell. Look, you probably don't think\NI should be asking you this. Will you go out with me tonight? Whoo! Hi there, Bud. Hey, Mr. Simpson.\NYour lawn looks great. Yes. TV REPAIRMAN:\NBud. David. Well, come here, young fella. You know, I've been thinking. I might've been a little hasty the other day\Nwhen you asked to come home. It just took me by such surprise,\Nyou know? Ha-ha-ha. So even though\NI can't make any promises... ...well, I figured\Nif you asked me real nice... ...I might just be willing\Nto talk about it again. - I can't.\N- What? - Talk about it right now. I mean...\N- I'll be honest with you, Bud. I'm getting a little concerned about\Nwhat I'm seeing on some of these reruns. Reruns? Like when Margaret Henderson\Nmakes her cookies for Whitey. - Those are not your cookies, Bud.\N- Yes, I know. I know they are not my cookies... Those are Whitey's cookies, Bud.\NThey belong to him. He eats them,\Nthen he asks her to go to Lovers' Lane... I would love to talk about this right now,\Nbut I am really in a hurry. - Bud. Don't touch...\N- I can't hear you. It's really cruddy reception.\NWe'll talk later. What's wrong? Listen... You're reading. I can't believe you started\Nsuch a dorky fad. It's D. H... ...Lawrence. - You ever heard of him?\N- Yeah. Yeah, I read a couple pages.\NSeemed kind of sexy. It is. Hey, can I ask you a question? Sure. - How come I'm still in black and white?\N- What? I've had like 10 times as much sex\Nas the rest of these girls... ...and I still look like this. They spend an hour\Nin the back seat of some car... ...and all of a sudden\Nthey're in Technicolor? I don't know.\NMaybe it's not just the sex. - Where is it?\N- A little bit farther, I think. DJ [ON RADIO]:\NWKPV, the sounds of Pleasantville. Here's a new one\Nfor all you kids out at Lovers' Lane. [ETTA JAMES' "AT LAST" PLAYING] Wow. - It's amazing, huh?\N- Yeah. We're closed right now. - Oh, I'm sorry. I...\N- Oh, hi. Hi. I just thought that... No, no, no. Come on in. BETTY:\NIt's beautiful.

Look at this. - Where did you get this?\N- Bud brought it to me. - My Bud?\N- Yeah. Here's my favorite. What do you think? Isn't it great\Nhow she's resting like that? She's crying. No, she's not. BETTY:\NYes, she is. - Wait. It's all right.\N- No. No. I've gotta go. Let me see. It's beautiful. You shouldn't cover that up. Here. Let me... I just... Let me just... So, what's it like? - What?\N- Out there. Well, it's... It's louder... ...and scarier, I guess. And it's a lot more dangerous. Sounds fantastic. The other night,\Nsome kids came up here to go swimming... ...and they took off\Nall their clothes. Do you want some berries? Huh? MARGARET:\NSome berries. I picked them myself. - Really?\N- Mm-hm. Yeah, there's lots of stuff. Like what? Um... Here. I'll show you. Here. Go ahead. Try it. [CLATTERING] SKIP:\NMary Sue. What are you doing? It's 6:30. So? We were gonna... You know. Oh.

[UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING\NOVER SPEAKERS] [LAUGHING] George? [MEN WHISPERING] What happened? Are you all right? What is it? Rain. Real rain? [THUNDER CRASHES] [MUSIC STOPS] Oh, my God. Are you all right? I came home like I always do... ...and I went in the front door... ...and I took off my coat... ...and I put down my briefcase... ...and I said, "Honey, I'm home." Only there was no one there. [MEN MURMURING] No wife. No lights. - No dinner.\NROY: No dinner? I went to the oven. I thought maybe she had made\None of those TV dinners. - Yeah, sure.\N- She hadn't. She was gone. I looked and looked and looked. She was gone. It's gonna be fine, George. You're with us now. What are we gonna do, Bob? Well, we're safe for now.\NThank goodness we're in a bowling alley. But if George here\Ndoesn't get his dinner... ...any one of us could be next. It could be you, Gus. Or you, Roy. Or even you, Ralph. That is real rain out there, gentlemen. This isn't some little virus\Nthat'll clear up on its own. Something is happening to our town. And I think we can all see\Nwhere it's coming from. Roy. Why don't you show them\Nwhat you showed me before? But, Bob... It's okay, Roy. Come on up here. I know, Roy. [ALL GASP] Thanks. He asked her what she was doing. She said, "Nothing."\NShe was just thinking. My friends, this isn't about\NGeorge's dinner. It's not about Roy's shirt. It's a question of values. It's a question of whether\Nwe wanna hold on to those values... ...that made this place great. So a time has come to make a decision. Are we in this thing alone... ...or are we in it together? Together. - Together.\N- Together. MEN [CHANTING]:\NTogether. Together. Together. Together. Together. [THUNDER CRASHING] [BIRDS CHIRPING] BETTY: I told you where I was.\NGEORGE: All night? BETTY: I got caught in the storm.\NYou were gone all night too. Look... Let's just forget about it.\NWe'll just go to the meeting.

Look at my face.\NThat meeting's not for me. - You'll put on some makeup.\N- I don't wanna put on some makeup. It goes away. It'll go away. I don't want it to go away. Now, you listen to me. You're coming to this meeting. You're going to put on some makeup. You're going to be home\Nat 6:00 every night... ...and you're going to have dinner\Nready on this table. No, I'm not, sweetie. I made you a meat loaf. Just put it in the oven\Nand turn this little knob up to 350. If you put the pie in\N40 minutes later... ...it'll be hot in time for dessert. Um...

We're supposed to go around\Nand let everyone know about it. I thought maybe it was because\Nyou were too busy... ...entertaining your colored girlfriend. [PETE LAUGHS] Hey, why don't you guys\Nget the hell out of here? All right. We'll do that. You know, Margaret,\Nyou can come over... ...and make those oatmeal cookies for me\Nanytime you want to. [BOTH LAUGHING] [CROWD CLAMORING] BIG BOB:\NPeople. - People.\N- Roy Campbell's got a blue front door. - It's always been blue.\N- People. People, please. Please. I think we all know\Nwhat's been going on here. Up until now... ...everything around here\Nhas always been, well, pleasant. [CROWD MURMURS] Recently, certain things\Nhave become unpleasant. MAN: Hear, hear.\N- Now, it seems to me... ...that the first thing\Nwe have to do... ...is to separate out the things\Nthat are pleasant... ...from the things that are unpleasant. [CROWD MURMURING] [BELL TOLLING] [TIRES SCREECH]\N[BIKE CRASHES] WOMAN 1: That's Betty Parker.\NWOMAN 2: That is an outrage. [CROWD MURMURING] TV REPAIRMAN:\NWhat the hell do you think you're doing? Get in here. Now. You think this is a toy? You think it's your own little\Ngoddamn coloring book? - Look, it just sort of happened.\N- A deluge doesn't just happen. Bolts of lightning don't just happen. I didn't do anything wrong. Oh, no? Let me show you something. Go on, try it. TV REPAIRMAN: Boom! Right there.\NWhat do you call that, huh? You know, you don't deserve this place. You don't deserve to live in this paradise. - Where's the remote control I gave you?\N- Why? Because you're coming home,\Nyou little twerp... ...and I'm gonna put this place\Nback the way it was. - I can't let you do that.\N- What? I'm sorry.\NI'm not gonna let you do that.

[CLEARS THROAT] This is not the answer, people. No matter how upset we may get... ...or how frustrated we may be... ...we're not gonna solve our problems\Nout in the street. It's just the wrong way to do it. We have to find a code of conduct... ...that we can all agree to live by. Now, I asked George and Ralph here\Nto sketch out a few ideas... ...and I think they've done a terrific job. Now, if we can all agree to these,\Nwe can take a vote... ...and I think we can start off\Nin the right direction. [CROWD MURMURING] "One: All public disruption\Nand acts of vandalism... ...are to cease immediately. Two: All citizens of Pleasantville... ...are to treat each other\Nin a courteous and pleasant manner." "Courteous and pleasant manner."\NWell, that's not too bad. "Three: The area commonly known\Nas Lovers' Lane... ...as well as the public library... ...shall be closed until further notice. [MURMURING] Four: The only permissible recorded music\Nshall be the following: Johnny Mathis, Perry Como,\NJack Jones... ...the marches of John Philip Sousa,\Nor 'The Star-Spangled Banner.' In no event\Nshall any music be tolerated... ...that is not of a temperate\Nor pleasant nature. [MURMURING] Five: There shall be\Nno public sale of umbrellas... ...or preparation for inclement weather\Nof any kind. Six: No bed frame\Nor mattress may be sold... ...measuring more than 38 inches wide. Seven: The only permissible\Npaint colors... ...shall be black, white, or gray... ...despite the recent availability\Nof certain alternatives. Eight: All elementary\Nand high-school curriculum... ...shall teach the non-changeist\Nview of history... ...emphasizing continuity\Nover alteration." Wow. Hey. This thing still works. [BUDDY HOLLY'S "RAVE ON" PLAYING] Turn that off.\NYou're not allowed to do that now. Sure, you are. [SONG PLAYING] DAVID:\NOh, this is good. Just do it? Don't worry.\NWe'll get you a new one. I don't know what I'd do\Nif I couldn't paint anymore, Bud. Maybe I have an idea. WOMAN 1:\NDisgusting. It scares me. [CROWD MURMURING] WOMAN 2:\NYou should be ashamed of yourselves. WOMAN 3:\NThis is disgusting. [CROWD SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY] [KIDS WHISPERING] LISA ANNE:\NWhen are they gonna let them out? POLICE CHIEF DAN:\NHey, what are you kids doing out there?

She went out for a little while. When? Three days ago. Jeez, everything is so cockeyed. I didn't even know it was Tuesday. Tuesday we play bridge\Nwith the Jenkins. There was no bridge. It's... Can I have one of those? Sure. Yeah. You hungry? [GEORGE CHUCKLES] Mrs. Benson was making\Nmeat loaf next door. I almost climbed in her kitchen window. What happened?\NOne minute, everything's fine. The next... What went wrong? Nothing went wrong. People change. People change? Yeah, people change. Can they change back? I don't know. I think it's harder. - You okay?\N- Yeah. Yeah. Not fair, you know? - You get used to one thing, and then...\N- I know. It's not. BIG BOB:\NBud Parker, William Johnson... ...you are charged with the desecration\Nof a public building... ...and the use\Nof prohibited paint colors... ...in violation of\Nthe Pleasantville code of conduct... ...and laws of common decency. Do you admit that on the night\Nof May 1 st... ...you did willfully apply the following\Nforbidden paint colors... ...to the north wall\Nof the Pleasantville police station: Red, pink, vermilion, puce, chartreuse... ...umber, blue, aqua, oxblood,\Ngreen, peach, crimson... ...yellow, olive, and magenta? Yeah, I do. Where's our lawyer? I think we wanna keep these proceedings\Nas pleasant as possible. I don't think a lawyer\Nwill be necessary. [CROWD CHUCKLING] Do you further admit\Nthat this unnatural depiction... ...occurred in full public view\Nwhere it was accessible to... ...and in plain sight\Nof minor children? It was accessible to everyone. Let the record show\Nthat the defendants have answered... ...in the affirmative to all charges. Do you have anything\Nto say in your defense? - Yeah, I do...\N- Bill? I didn't mean to hurt anybody. Maybe if I painted\Nsomething different. Or maybe I could use\Nless colors or something. Or, you know, certain colors.\NOr maybe I could... You could pick out\Nthe colors beforehand... ...and then they wouldn't\Nbother anybody. - I've got something to say.\N- Very well. You don't have a right to do this. [CROWD MURMURING] I mean... ...I know you want it\Nto stay pleasant around here... ...but there are so many things... ...that are so much better. Like silly or sexy... ...or dangerous or brief. And every one of those things\Nis in you all the time... ...if you just have the guts\Nto look for them. [GAVEL POUNDS] - Enough.\N- I thought I was allowed to defend myself. - You're not allowed to lie.\N- I'm not lying. You see those faces up there?\NThey're no different than you are. They just happen to see something\Ninside themselves... [GAVEL POUNDS] - I said, that's enough.\N- I'll show you. Dad? Yeah, Bud? It's okay, Dad. Just listen for a sec. I know you miss her. I mean, you told me you did. But maybe it's not just the cooking... ...or the cleaning that you miss. Maybe it's something else. Maybe you can't even describe it. Maybe you only know it\Nwhen it's gone. Maybe it's like there's a whole piece\Nof you that's missing too. Look at her, Dad. Doesn't she look pretty like that? Doesn't she look just as beautiful... ...as the first time you met her? You really want her back\Nthe way she was? Doesn't she look wonderful? Now, don't you wish\Nyou could tell her that? [CROWD GASPING] BIG BOB:\NYou're out of order. DAVID:\NWhy am I out of order? BIG BOB: I'm not gonna let you turn\Nthis courtroom into a circus. I don't think it's a circus,\Nand I don't think they do either. [CROWD GASPS]\N[GAVEL POUNDS] - This behavior must stop at once.\N- But see? That's just the point. It can't stop at once,\Nbecause it's in you... ...and you can't stop something\Nthat's inside you. It is not inside me. - Oh, sure, it is.\N- No, it is not. What do you wanna do to me\Nright now? Come on. Everyone is turning colors. Kids are making out in the street. No one is getting their dinner.\NHell, you could have a flood. Pretty soon, the women\Ncould be going to work... ...while the men stayed at home\Nand cooked. - That is not going to happen.\N- But it could. No, it could not! [CROWD MURMURING] Bud.
