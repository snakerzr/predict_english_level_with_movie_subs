You'd better get married soon. You're starting to look old. My dad's been saying that to me\Nsince I was fifteen. Because nice Greek girls are\Nsupposed to do three things in life: marry Greek boys, make Greek\Nbabies and feed everyone... until the day we die. When I was growing up,\NI knew I was different. The other girls were\Nblond and delicate. And I was a swarthy 6 year-old\Nwith sideburns. I so badly wanted to be\Nlike the popular girls... all sitting together, talking... eating their\NWonderbread sandwiches... -What's that?\N-It's ''moussaka''. ''Moose-caca''? The pretty girls went to Brownie's.\NI had to go to Greek school. At Greek school, I learned\Nvaluable lessons like: ''If Nick has one goat, and Maria\Nhas nine, how soon will they marry? My mom was always cooking foods\Nfilled with warmth and wisdom. And never forgetting that side dish\Nof steaming hot guilt. Niko, don't play with the food! -At your age, we didn't have food.\N-Ma? -What?\N-Why do I have to go to Greek school? When you get married, don't you\Nwant to write your mother-in-law? Niko, come on, eat! We lived in a normal middle-class\NChicago neighborhood... of tasteful modest homes. Our house, however,\Nwas modeled after the Parthenon... complete with Corinthian columns\Nand guarded by statues of the gods. In case the neighbors had\Nany doubts about our heritage... they could just check out our\Nsubtle tribute to the Greek flag. My dad believed\Nin only two things: that Greeks should educate\Nnon-Greeks about being Greek... and that any illment,\Nfrom psoriasis to poison-ivy... could be cured with Windex. Six years later: I was 1 2, Athena,\Nmy older perfect sister, was 1 5... and my brother Nick was 1 1. Every\Nmorning, my dad would lecture us... on the history of our people,\Nthe great civilization: the Greeks. Now, name three things\Nthe Greeks did first. -Astronomy, philosophy and democracy.\N-Bravo! Very good. Now, give me a word... any word, and I'll show you how\Nthe root of that word is Greek. Okay?\NHow about arachnophobia? ''Arachna'', that comes from\Nthe Greek word for ''spider''... and ''phobia'' means ''fear'',\Nso fear of spider. There you go. Okay, Mr. Portokalos.\NHow about the word ''kimono''? Kimono? Kimono, kimono... Of course! ''Kimono'' comes\Nfrom the Greek word ''cheimonas''... that means ''winter''. So, what do you wear in the winter\Ntime to stay warm? A robe. You see? Robe, kimono.\NThere you go. -Bye-bye.\N-Good-bye, Mr. Portokalos. Toula! You should be proud to be Greek. Years went by, and dad brought his\Nmother from Greece to live with us... because we weren't weird enough. Listen up, ugly Turk. You're not kidnapping me. -Get her! Where is she going?\N-Mama, please. The Greeks and the Turks\Nare friends now! We told my grandma that war was\Nover, but she still slept with a knife. Mama! Stop hitting me! Niko, be careful!\NShe has a very mean punch! -Mama!\N-Please, come back! Nice Greek girls who don't find a\Nhusband work in the family restaurant. So, here I am, day after day,\Nyear after year... thirty, and way passed\Nmy expiration date. It's freezing! Fortoula! You closed last night,\Nyou're opening this morning. I have no life. Ah, Toula, you talk\Nto me sometime, uh? Ma, you're going to make me\Nswallow my tongue. Toula! ls Nikki here? -What's up there?\N-No, my Nikki. She was supposed to come over\Nto curl my hair. Nick, did you check the meat\Nbefore you signed for it? -Dad checked it.\N-It'd better be fresh. My brother has 2 jobs: to cook\Nand to marry a Greek virgin. Voula, have something to eat\Nbefore you go to work. If nagging was an Olympic sport, my\Naunt Voula would have a gold medal. Taki. You couldn't wait for me? -Sorry. Sorry.\N-''Sorry''. Don't ''sorry'' me. Look at this. Rash.\NSomebody gave me the ''mati''. -Put some Windex on.\N-Please, please! Voula, this works! Last night, my toe was\Nas big as my face. So why didn't you wait for me? Because... He wants to talk. Anyway, I tell her I will\Nsend her to Greece... ...to find somebody.\N-Say, is she not too old? -She's okay.\N-In Greece... ...don't tell anyone how old she is.\N-She won't go! -She won't go?\N-It's like she doesn't want to marry. Come on, we're going\Nto see uncle Nick. My sister married young and became\Na Greek baby breeding machine. Look at those! Quick coffee. I'll drop the boys off\Nat hockey and then go to the Jewel. Pantyhose are on for 99 cents. The priest is coming to bless the new\Nhouse, so I have to make ''diples''. Can you believe it? I'm out\Nof honey. Put that back for me. -Angelo...\N-Shut up, Nikki! My cousins have two volumes:\Nloud and louder. -Thanks, Toula.\N-We're not that late. Oh, Angelo, my boy! Nikki, how come you didn't come\Nto curl my hair this morning? Ma, I had to drop Dimos at work. And now I gotta go\Nto the travel agency... because some jag-off and his\Nbig-ass girlfriend are too busy. I open the dry-cleaners every day.\NIt's about time she did something. -You know who's at the dry-cleaners?\N-You're always at the beauty salon... -My husband.\N-...doing your nails and your hair. Don't you talk about my hair. You and\Nyour big-ass girlfriend do nothing! Did somebody sit on your hair?\NIt looks a little flat there. Angelo, bite me! -Be a lady!\N-Ma... -Angelo.\N-Come on, boys! Let's go! -Athena! When did you come?\N-Hi, ma. Bye, ma. -Are you going?\N-I'll get you pantyhose at Jewel. No queen-size.\NThey make me look fat. Who put the menus there? Toula, what's this? -What is this?\N-I don't know. Mama! Mama! -Don't forget I need ''diples''...\N-And the ''pastichio''. You told me. -Athena, go! My God! Go!\N-Okay. -Alright, we're going to go.\N-Bye! -I want to drive.\N-You drive me crazy. Let's go! Watch your step.\NDon't run! -To me, she looks okay.\N-Okay? What okay? No okay. She's not okay. Athena's married\Nwith three children! And I'll get married, pops.\Nl promise. You have plenty of time, Niko. And you'll always have Toula\Nto run the restaurant. It's true.\NToula will never leave you. I wish I had a different life. I wish I was braver\Nand prettier... or just happy.\NBut it's useless to dream... because nothing ever changes. -Hey, what's going on?\N-Hi, man. How are you? -Good, and you?\N-I'm good. -Cool place.\N-Yeah, it's adorable. You missed a hell of a party\Nthe other night. Look at that. That could've been\Nyou with that arm around her. You set me up with her already. -Nancy?\N-Henson's picnic. No, that was Pamela.\NThis is Nancy. They look the same. Well, maybe. So, do you\Nwant me to set you up? They're all the same, Mike. -Hi.\N-Hi. Sorry. My brain just stopped.\NHave you ever had one of those days? Going along and then stops. Here\Nl am, your private Greek statue. -Can I get some more coffee, please?\N-Sure. Thank you. All right, let's go. -What do you mean? I just got here.\N-I know. I've got a class, though. -I loved this spice. What is that?\N-Like I care. Come on. I'm giving a pop-quiz and\Nl can't wait to hear the groans. Man, you're tough. I'm giving a test\Non Hamlet, but I gave fair warning. Hi. Keep the change. -Do you like this? For the new menu?\N-Where did you get that? I drew it, dad. Dad. Dad. Dad, I've been going\Nthrough our inventory... and I've noticed that we've been\Ndoing a lot of unnecessary ordering. So I've been thinking.\NMaybe we should update our system. Like, we could get a computer. I don't know if you remember,\Nbut I got all A's in Computers. But there's a lot of new stuff\Nto learn now, so, if you want... I could go to college\Nand take a few courses. Why... Why do you want to leave me? I'm not leaving you. Don't you want\Nme to do something with my life? Yes! Get married!\NMake babies! You look so... old! Toula. Toula. Come on, Toula. I know what you want. You have,\Nhow do you say? You have a spirit. You want to see things,\Nyou want to learn. I know. You're from my side. Come on, don't you worry.\NI'm going to talk to him. Dad is stubborn. What he says goes.\N''The man is the head of the house''. Let me tell you something, Toula:\Nthe man is the head... but the woman is the neck. She can\Nturn the head anywhere she wants. My baby.\NDon't cry, don't cry, come on. What's wrong with Toula going\Nto school downtown? -There is drugs downtown.\N-What are you saying? That Toula will get\Ninvolved with drugs? No, but somebody will say to her: ''Take this bag down to the\Nbus depot'', and she'll do it! -She's not stupid! She's smart!\N-I know she's smart. So what for she needs more school?\NShe's smart enough for a girl. You think you're\Nsmarter than me, uh? -No, I mean... You know...\N-What? What do you mean? I run the restaurant, I cook,\Nl clean, I wash for you... and I raised three kids, and\Nl teach Sunday school, you know? It's lucky for me\Nl have you to tie my shoes! Maria... Excuse me, is this seat taken? -What are you two talking about?\N-About my butt. -I don't like it, but Taki likes it.\N-Listen, I'm not going to pretend... this is something I've always wanted\Nto do. I'm just saying it's different. I've been learning about computers. There's this course. It's a seminar\Nall about computers and tourism... with all the latest applications\Nand programs. I could apply it here. Your business would double, triple.\NYou could be with ''theo'' more. You could take a vacation. I could\Nbook it for you. Would you hire me? Of course. Oh, my God!\NOkay! Okay! I'm sorry. Oh, my God, ma! We must let Costa think this was\Nhis idea. That he came up with it. -Ma, he's going to figure it out.\N-Don't you worry. -I know what to do.\N-No, you talk, talk, talk. -Do you want my help?\N-Yes, I want your help. -But don't tell me what to say.\N-Perfect. So, Voula, how is business? Oh, war to me!\NBusiness is bad. What's the matter? What happened?\NYou need money? No, no. What she means is that,\Nwith two businesses, she suffers. -She suffers?\N-She is at the travel agency alone... because everybody else is working\Nat the big dry-cleaning store. That's right. I make Taki go\Nto the dry-cleaners store... and now I have no time with him. So send Angelo or Nikki\Nto the travel agency... and you'll be with Taki\Nat the dry-cleaner. -That would be good.\N-That would be no good. -No good?\N-No good, no good. Because neither Angelo or Nikki\Nknow how to use the computer. That's why that won't work. Computer? I have your answer! Toula will go to the travel agency,\Nand Nikki comes here to work for us. I can't believe that. -Wonderful. Wonderful!\N-You see? A man. -Yes! You're so smart!\N-Costa, Costa! Mrs. Cristakis? Thanks for holding.\NYour request is confirmed. It's now P&R'ed. Okay, hold\Nagain, please. Hi, British Airways? I'll need a hard tick on that one.\NAlfa, Bravo, Fox-Trot, Charlie. Copy that. Hi, Mrs. Cristakis?\NYour tickets are now in the mail... under Doreen Cristakis.\NOkay, thank you. Bye-bye. What's the time? The time? And now, the last contestant\Non ''The Price Is Right''! I'll get it. Did you lose this? Bloodthirsty Turks. Mrs. White!\NYou find my mama again? You know, she comes from Greece. -The country I come from too.\N-For God's sake, I know! Listen, keep your mother\Noff my lawn... out of my basement\Nand away from my roof! Mrs. White, come on.\NGive me a word, any word... and I'll show you that\Nthe root of that word... is Greek. Look, everybody.\NLook who's back again! -Hi, Yaya.\N-Sit down, Yaya. Very good. Toula, there are\Ntwo kinds of people: Greeks and everybody else\Nwho wish they were Greek. Okay. Yes, we know! What's the matter with her? Mount Olympus Travel Agency,\Nmay I help you? Sure, that's what we do. -What are you doing? Wait!\N-Absolutely. Right. Sorry, lady. Sure. You can book it now.\Nl can reserve the seat for you. Be with you in a second.\NThat would be no problem. All right, call me back when you are\Nready to book. Thank you. Bye-bye. Hi. Hi. Did you want to see\Nsome brochures? Found them. -Like this?\N-No. And then '' woosh'' .\NGod, I thought you'd fainted. Oh, okay. Yeah. I was swept off my feet by your\Nvery cool opening line: ''Hi''. So, Toula... lan. lan Miller. -Toula... Porkypakos?\N-Portokalos. -Okay. Toula.\N-All right then. So was that a biker fight\Nor a nose job? -Yeah.\N-No, really. You don't want to know. Well, if I had survived an old lady\Nass-kicking, I'd brag about it. Jesus! Ouch! -You want to have dinner with me?\N-Yeah. Actually, I wasn't in education first.\Nl was pre-law. My dad is a lawyer,\Nmy grandfather is a lawyer... This wasn't for me, so...\Nl picked a new major. -The parents weren't too pleased.\N-Yeah. I think... I think it takes a pretty\Nstrong person to do that. You know everything about me then:\NI'm a strong vegetarian teacher... over at Lincoln Park, and\Nl don't know anything about you... except you're Greek. Would you like to go\Nhave Greek food? -Oh, that's okay.\N-Listen, I know this great place. You probably know it.\NZorba's something. Anyway, I'd like to take you there,\Nif you'd like to go. -I don't want to go there.\N-What do you mean? Why not? That place,\NDancing Zorba's... Dancing Zorba's. My family owns that restaurant. Really? I remember you. You're that waitress. Sitting hostess, actually. -I remember you.\N-I was kind of going through a phase... up till now, and... I was frump girl. I don't remember frump girl,\Nbut I remember you. Okay, no Greek.\NItalian, tomorrow night? Okay. Where are you going? I'm taking a pottery class. The Greeks invented pottery. ...didn't have a taste for it.\Nl like poetry. It's crazy, right? It was just me, all alone,\Nup in the mountains... in this cottage with\Nmy parents all summer. Well, don't all your cousins\Ngo up too? No. I only have two cousins.\NThey live in Wisconsin. -You only have two cousins?\N-Yeah. How many do you have? More than two. Who else? Do you have brothers and\Nsisters? What are your parents like? What? Well... Okay. Christmas. What do you do\Nfor Christmas with your family? My mom makes roast lamb. With mint jelly? And...? And... ...I'm Greek, right?\N-Right. So my dad and my uncles fight over\Nwho gets to eat the lamb brain. My aunt Voula forks the eyeball\Nand chases me around with it... trying to get me to eat it, because\Nit's going to make me smart. You have 2 cousins. I have 27 first\Ncousins, just 27 first cousins alone. My whole family is big and loud... and everybody's in each other's\Nlives and business all the time. You never have a minute alone to\Nthink. We're always together, eating. All the other people we know\Nare Greeks. Greeks marry Greeks... to breed more Greeks,\Nto be loud breeding Greek eaters. I'm serious! No one in my family has ever gone out\Nwith a non-Greek before. No one. And you're... You're... God, you're just wonderful. But I just don't see how\Nthis is going to work out, so... Work out?\NWhat's to work out? We're not a different species. Yes, we come from\Ndifferent backgrounds and... Hey, here's some news about\Nmy life to this point: it's boring. Then I met you, and you're\Ninteresting, beautiful and fun. You've got a weird family.\NWho doesn't? I just want to spend\Nsome time with you. I just want to spend\Na little time with you. Did you say I'm beautiful? Yes. -Which house is yours?\N-This is good. Could you stop? -Sure.\N-Right here is good. Just stop. Thanks. Good night. Good night. Good night. Good night. -Okay, good night.\N-What? No, no, don't go. Good night. Don't go. And I can make a man out of you\NBecause I'm a woman W-O-M-A-N -Happy again today, Toula?\N-Yeah. Now, every time I see you,\Nyou have a great big smile. -Hey, Niko, where did you go?\N-Nowhere. -What did you do?\N-Nothing. -Who did you see?\N-No one. Wait a minute, Niko. I put them\Nin your room. Toula. Your class...\NHow is your class? My pottery class? -It's great.\N-Good. Good. -You've got to get out of here.\N-Just one more kiss and I'll go. No. What is going on? Mr. Pottery Class.\NNice to meet you. -Ian, this is my cousin Nikki.\N-Oh, hello. It's nice to finally meet\Na member of Toula's family. Yeah, well... I'm the least of your worries.\NListen, the family knows. Last night, Vicky Pavalopolis saw\Nyou sucking his lips in a parking lot. She told her ma,\Nwho told my ma, who told your ma. Let me put it this way:\Nyou're busted! You sneak around all over Chicago\Nbut you never come here to ask me... can you date my daughter? I'm sorry, but ask you\Nif I can date your daughter? -Sir, she's 30 years old.\N-I am the head of this house! Okay. May I please\Ndate your daughter? No! -I'll see you tomorrow.\N-See you tomorrow. Excuse me. Didn't I say it's a mistake\Nto educate women? But nobody listened to me. Now we have a boyfriend\Nin the house. ls he a nice Greek boy?\NOh, no, no Greek! No Greek, a ''xeno''! A ''xeno'' with big long hairs\Non top of his head. Costa... I'm sorry I lied to you. Okay, Toula. Maybe you are having\Na little romance. But end it now. I love him. Toula, eat something! Please. Your father\Nhas a friend for dinner. What's this? Where are we? My apartment. Do you want to go up? This is it. Don't worry.\NThey are going to love you. Toula. Now, that's not\Na name you hear every day. Does it mean anything\Nin your language? Well, my Greek name, Fortoula,\Nmeans ''light of God''. Who would like a coffee? So, you're Greek?\NWhat's you last name? -Portokalos.\N-In Greek, it means ''orange''. Like an orange that you eat, like\Nthe one with a peel. Not the color. Yeah, it's really Greek. Rodney, didn't you once\Nhave a Greek receptionist? No, Harriet, she was... -Just a minute.\N-Oh, no, no, she was Armenian. -ls Armenia close to Greece?\N-Not exactly. -What was she?\N-Who? -My secretary, for heaven sake.\N-Everyone like cheesecake? -Guatemalan.\N-That's right. She was Guatemalan. I love you. I love you. I don't... I don't know how to say this. What? Will you marry me? Yes! Yes! Now you can have this. Enough. Enough! What? Don't you walk\Naway from me. Sit down! Costa, they love each other. It's done! How? How can she do this to me? She didn't do this\Nto you or to me. They fell in love. It happens. ls he a good boy?\Nl don't know. ls he from a good family?\Nl don't know. ls he respectful? I don't know,\Nl don't know, I don't know... because nobody talks to me\Nabout nothing no more! A respectful boy would come here\Nand ask for my permission! My daughter engaged to a ''xeno''! I always thought she was going to be\Nmarried in the Greek orthodox church! Why is she doing this to me? ...leaves a space. Sometimes,\Nthat space is so big that... the roof can't support itself,\Nso it collapses. Excuse me. Try not to be too loud. What's going on? -Are you okay?\N-Can we go to Vegas? -What?\N-Or go to Niagara Falls. -Or to Fiji. Want to go to Fiji?\N-Sure. Okay. Let's go, come on.\NLet's just go. Come here. What's the matter? We can't get married.\NNot like this. It's like, when I'm with you... I'm so happy. But my family is so unhappy. And our wedding should be\Nthis joyous thing... but it won't be for them,\Nbecause it can't be at our church. So let's just go somewhere.\NPlease, let's just go. Let's just go! I love you. Why? Why do you love me? Because I came alive\Nwhen I met you. But my family... You're a part of your family... and I'll do anything, whatever\Nit takes to get them to accept me. Because you're my life now,\Nyou're my whole life now. We're not going to skulk off\Nand get married... as if we were ashamed\Nof ourselves. Okay? Did you say ''skulk''?\NLet's just skulk off somewhere... Come on, talk to him. Toula loves\Nhim. Do it for Toula, come on. Come on! He wants\Nto get married in the church! -Go, go!\N-All right. So, you're going to be\Nbaptized tomorrow, huh? Yeah. It's your lucky day to be baptized\Nin the Greek orthodox church! Nikki is going to be\Nyour godmother. You know, the word ''baptism''... comes from the\NGreek word ''vaticia''. That's where we dip the baby,\Nin a beautiful little silver basin. It's not so bad, huh? Are you kidding? Any minute now\Nhe's going to look at me and go: ''Right. You're so not worth this.'' Yes, you are. You're all oily. I'm Greek now. Thank you so much. Thank you. So, for Happy Easter, we say:\N''Christos Anesti''. Then the other person says back:\N''Alithos Anesti''. So if you wanna say Happy Easter,\Nyou go: ''Christos Anesti''. So try it. It's good. Hey, dad. Mr. Portokalos... When my people were\Nwriting philosophy... your people were still\Nswinging from trees. -He likes you.\N-Oh, yeah? -I told you to watch the boys!\N-They're having fun with videogames! -You'll turn their brains to mush.\N-I can't do anything right! Ian, if you're going to be in this\Nfamily, I'll get you some ear plugs. The Portokalos women, if they're\Nnot nagging somebody, they die! -You're in trouble. I'll tell her!\N-Tell me what? Where is she? Let me see you! Toula, you're engaged! We never thought it could\Nhappen for you, never! -Taki, didn't we say that?\N-We never thought the day'd come. Never, and it came!\Nls this him? -Yes, sorry. Everyone, this is Ian.\N-Ian! Christ is risen for sure,\Nif Toula found a husband. Toula found a husband! Nice to meet you. Hello, Ian! I want to see the bride. -Hey, Ian. Do you like that dance?\N-Oh, yeah. -Jenny wants to ask you something.\N-No, she does. Jenny, just ask me. -Does he have any brothers?\N-No, he's an only child. You know, I've got to tell you.\NI've never seen my sister so happy. If you hurt her, I'll kill you\Nand make it look like an accident. Ian, Jesus, look at your face.\NIt's just a joke. It's just a joke. -Good one.\N-The good one is I've got a gun. I've got a gun and I swear I'll\Njam it right up... I got you again! -Here, have some rice.\N-I don't... I'm good. Good? You know, I could\Nsnap you like a chicken! Come on, lighten up! I'll lighten you\Nwhen I take out your kidneys. -One more time, Ian! Hey, Angelo!\N-Ian, we're going to kill you! Ian, aunt Voula.\NLet me touch your hair. Let me. -''Thea'' Voula? ''Thea'' Voula, okay.\N-Okay, okay. -You come to my house and I'll cook.\N-Okay. -''Thea'', that might be a problem.\N-I'm the best cook here. Tell him. -Oh, I did. Didn't l?\N-Twice. Okay, then. It's just... Ian is a vegetarian.\NHe doesn't eat meat. -He ''don't'' eat no meat?\N-No, he doesn't eat meat. What do you mean,\Nhe ''don't'' eat no meat? Oh, that's okay. I make lamb.\NCome. Come. Dance. Greek. You watch. Silence. It's delicious. We took a look at my calendar...\Nour calendar and... set a day for the big day some time\Nat the end of October, mid November. -Some time there, yeah.\N-Wonderful. -I'll call the club, see what's open.\N-The club? The North Shore Country Club.\NFor the wedding, of course. We'll get married in Toula's church,\Nbecause we're not very religious... and her family is, really is.\NShow them the brochure. Oh, that. My cousin Nikki made me this. She tends to save things. This is\Nfrom her prom. She makes lamps... We got this great big hall.\NWhat's it called, for the reception? Aphrodite's Palace. It's not really a palace. Here's a brochure. That Parthenon backdrop...\NThat's optional. Maria, if we invited the Demakopolis,\Nwe have to invite the Adamopolis! They're cousins! Dad, the thing is that\Nwe just want to keep it small. You'd rather go bankrupt than\Ninsult anyone from the church. Toula, I came to this country\Nwith US$ 8 in my pocket... to make all this for you. Who knows how long\NI'm going to be alive? Let me see the list. Okay! Okay!\NCome on, time out! -No more punching my 'nads, okay?\N-Stop hitting ''theo'' Nikko! Look at you!\NHow big you are! -Yanni, take them to soccer practice!\N-Boys, come on, soccer practice! -Did she spit on him?\N-Boys, go outside with your father. Yeah, it's for good luck.\NIt keeps the devil away. Bye! Wait for me! Dad. -Where did you get that?\N-I drew it for the menu, remember? -Mom, I'm hungry.\N-Okay, Niko. Ian, are you hungry? -No, I already ate.\N-Okay, I'll make you something. Okay. Now, Toula, we have to have\NTommy Cassimatis. -Hey, let me help you with those.\N-What is wrong with Tommy? -I don't know them, okay?\N-Who cares? They're related to me! -Why are you being so weird?\N-I'm not being weird. Ian, eat, eat! How do you say\N''thank you'' in Greek? That's it. You got it. Nice boobs. Dad... Toula! Listen, I've got the greatest\Nconnection for your invitations. No, Nick, we're going to order\Nour own invitations, okay? I don't want us to have something\Nthat falls off the back of a truck. -Yeah, but they come through, right?\N-For God's sake, let the man talk! -Why are you always so stubborn?\N-Toula, Athena... I ordered the invitations\Ntwo weeks ago. -I never saw a wedding invitation.\N-I'll go get them. They're beautiful. -Ma!\N-Wait until you see them. -They're nice.\N-Bravo, Maria. My parents' names are\NRodney and Harriet. -''Rodney and Harry''?\N-''Rodney and Harry''. -''Rodney and Harry''!\N-I didn't notice. I bet they won't. ''Yatzis'', everybody.\NHi, Yaya. Wait, I have got the biggest scoop.\NLook at the earrings... I found that match\Nthe bridesmaids' dresses! A customer at the dry-cleaners\Nis a custom jewelry designer. -So I showed her the fabric...\N-Wait, what do these match? -Not that fabric you showed me?\N-You said you liked it. -I said I'd think about it.\N-That's just because... you couldn't visualize it. -Nikki!\N-You're so beautiful! -You don't have to do a thing.\N-That's classy! I went by the college\Nand picked this up. Look. I'm going to start slowly,\Ndoing a couple of night courses. I just wanted to learn more\Nabout painting, and art and stuff. This is so great. You started it.\NYou wanted to do something else... and you did it. Toula... don't let your past\Ndictate who you are... but let it be part\Nof who you will become. Nick, that is so beautiful. That Dear Abby... She really\Nknows what she's talking about. Hi, ma. It's me. All right.

Where is it? -It was here, but it's gone now.\N-Why? I put some Windex on it. Welcome to the Portokalos family. Welcome the Miller family. I was thinking last night... the night before my... daughter was going\Nto marry lan Miller... that the root of the word\N''Miller'' is a Greek word. ''Miller'' comes from\Nthe Greek word ''milo''... which means ''apple'',\Nso there you go. As many of you know,\Nour name, Portokalos... comes from the Greek word\N''portokali'', which means ''orange''. Okay, here tonight we have... apple and orange. We're all different... but, in the end, we're all fruit. Yes, we're all fruit. My wife and me, we have a gift. See, that's what we do.\NThe parents, they give a gift. Here. Oh, my God.\NThey bought us a house. Thank you. I don't believe that. A house! -''Thea'' Voula, we're going to dance.\N-I know, dear. Let me get Taki. Athena, I'm going to be a painter! Good! You can start\Nwith our fence. This is just\Na really nice wedding. That's good. We're going\Nto dance now. Come on! Oh, no. I think I need some\Nmore of those before I do that. What do you say? Bottoms up! -All right.\N-Let's go, ''Harry''. Come on, Costa! Oh, Taki... he looks Greek. That's it. Like this. Everybody dance. Everybody dance, dance. Sometimes, I'm afraid\Nthat it didn't happen. I'm scared I'll wake up and still\Nbe buttering garlic bread... waiting for my life to start.\NBut it did happen. It did!\NAnd I figured out some stuff. My family is big and loud,\Nbut they're my family. We fight, we laugh and, yes,\Nwe roast lamb in the front yard. And wherever I go, whatever I do,\Nthey will always be there. So, Ian and I moved into the house\Nmy parents bought us. A minute later, I was pregnant,\Nand 6 years later... it was our daughter's turn\Nto go to Greek school. -But mom, I want to go to Brownie's!\N-I know, I know... but I promise you this:\Nyou can marry anybody you want. Thanks, baby.\NGreek school, ''pomi''! -What does that mean?\N-''Let's go''. -Let's go.\N-That's really good. -Looking good, Gus.\N-Hi, dad. -Where are you going?\N-Greek school.
