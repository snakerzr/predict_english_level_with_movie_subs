Hello. My name's Forrest. Forrest Gump. Do you want a chocolate? I could eat about\Na million and a half of these. My mama always said\Nlife was like a box of chocolates. You never know what you're gonna get. Those must be comfortable shoes. I'll bet you could walk all day\Nin shoes like that and not feel a thing. I wish I had shoes like that. My feet hurt. Mama always said there's an awful lot you could tell about a person\Nby their shoes: Where they're going,\Nwhere they've been. I've worn lots of shoes. I bet if I think about it real hard,\NI could remember my first pair of shoes. Mama said they'd take me anywhere. She said they was my magic shoes. All right, Forrest,\Nyou can open your eyes now. Let's take a little walk around. How do those feel? His legs are strong, Mrs. Gump, as strong as I've ever seen, but his back is as crooked\Nas a politician. But we're gonna straighten him right up,\Nnow, aren't we, Forrest? Forrest! Now, when I was a baby, Mama named me after\Nthe great Civil War hero, General Nathan Bedford Forrest. She said we was related to him\Nin some way. And what he did was, he started up this club called\Nthe Ku Klux Klan. They'd all dress up in their robes\Nand their bed sheets and act like a bunch of ghosts\Nor spooks or something. They'd even put bed sheets\Non their horses and ride around. And anyway, that's how I got my name, Forrest Gump. Mama said that the "Forrest" part was to remind me that sometimes\Nwe all do things that, well, just don't make no sense. Okay... Get it, get it... Wait, is it this way? Hold on. All right... What are you all staring at? Haven't you ever seen a little boy\Nwith braces on his legs before? Don't ever let anybody tell you\Nthey're better than you, Forrest. If God intended\Neverybody to be the same, he'd have given us all braces\Non our legs. Mama always had a way of\Nexplaining things so I could understand them. We lived about a quarter mile\Noff Route 17, about a half mile from\Nthe town of Greenbow, Alabama. That's in the county of Greenbow. Our house had been in Mama's family\Nsince her grandpa's grandpa's grandpa had come across the ocean\Nabout 1,000 years ago, something like that. Since it was just me and Mama\Nand we had all these empty rooms, Mama decided to let those rooms out, mostly to people passing through, like from, oh, Mobile,\NMontgomery, places like that. That's how me and Mama got money. Mama was a real smart lady. Remember what I told you, Forrest.\NYou're no different than anybody else is. Did you hear what I said, Forrest? You're the same as everybody else.\NYou are no different. Your boy's different, Mrs. Gump. Now, his IQ is 75. Well, we're all different, Mr. Hancock. She wanted me to have\Nthe finest education, so she took me to\Nthe Greenbow County Central School. I met the principal and all. I want to show you something,\NMrs. Gump. Now, this is normal. Forrest is right here. The state requires a minimum IQ of\N80 to attend public school, Mrs. Gump. He's gonna have to go\Nto a special school. Now, he'll be just fine. What does "normal" mean, anyway? He might be a bit on the slow side, but my boy Forrest is gonna get the same opportunities\Nas everyone else. He's not going to some special school\Nto learn how to re-tread tires. We're talking about\Nfive little points here. There must be something can be done. We're a progressive school system. We don't want to see anybody\Nleft behind. Is there a Mr. Gump, Mrs. Gump? He's on vacation. Well, your mama sure does care\Nabout your schooling, son. You don't say much, do you? "Finally, he had to try. "It looked easy, but, "oh, what happened. - "First, there... "\N- Mama, what's "vacation" mean? - Vacation?\N- Where Daddy went. Vacation's when you go somewhere and you don't ever come back. Anyway, I guess you could\Nsay me and Mama was on our own. But we didn't mind.\NOur house was never empty. There was always folks\Ncoming and going. Supper. - It's supper, everyone. Forrest...\N- My, my. That sure looks special. Sometimes we had\Nso many people staying with us that every room\Nwas filled with travelers. You know, folks living out\Nof their suitcases and hat cases and sample cases. Forrest Gump, it's supper time! Forrest... One time, a young man\Nwas staying with us, and he had him a guitar case. Forrest! I told you not to bother\Nthis nice young man. Oh, no, that's all right, ma'am. I was just showing him a thing or two\Non the guitar here. All right, but your supper's ready\Nif y'all want to eat. Yeah, that sounds good.\NThank you, ma'am. Say, man, show me that crazy\Nlittle walk you just did there. Slow it down some. I liked that guitar. It sounded good. I started moving around to the music, swinging my hips. This one night,\Nme and Mama was out shopping, and we walked right by\NBenson's furniture and appliance store, and guess what? This is not for children's eyes. Some years later,\Nthat handsome young man who they called "The King," well, he'd sung too many songs, had himself a heart attack,\Nor something. Must be hard being a king. You know, it's funny how you remember\Nsome things, but some things you can't. - You do your very best now, Forrest.\N- I sure will, Mama. I remember the bus ride\Non the first day of school very well. Are you coming along? Mama said not to be taking\Nrides from strangers. This is the bus to school. I'm Forrest. Forrest Gump. - I'm Dorothy Harris.\N- Well, now we ain't strangers anymore. This seat's taken. It's taken! You can't sit here. You know, it's funny what\Na young man recollects, 'cause I don't remember being born. I don't recall what I got\Nfor my first Christmas, and I don't know when I went\Non my first outdoor picnic. But I do remember the first time I heard the sweetest voice in the wide world. You can sit here if you want. I had never seen anything\Nso beautiful in my life. She was like an angel. Well, are you gonna sit down,\Nor aren't you? What's wrong with your legs? Nothing at all, thank you.\NMy legs are just fine and dandy. I just sat next to her on that bus and had a conversation\Nall the way to school. ...my back's crooked like\Na question mark. These are going to make me... And next to Mama, no one ever\Ntalked to me or asked me questions. Are you stupid or something? Mama says, "Stupid is as stupid does. " - I'm Jenny.\N- I'm Forrest. Forrest Gump. From that day on,\Nwe was always together. Jenny and me was like\Npeas and carrots. She taught me how to climb. Come on, Forrest, you can do it. I showed her how to dangle. "... a good little monkey and... " She helped me learn how to read,\Nand I showed her how to swing. Sometimes we'd just sit out\Nand wait for the stars. - Mama's gonna worry about me.\N- Just stay a little longer. For some reason,\NJenny didn't never want to go home. Okay, Jenny, I'll stay. She was my most special friend. My only friend. Now, my mama always told me that\Nmiracles happen every day. Some people don't think so, but they do. Hey, dummy! Are you retarded, or just plain stupid? - "Look, I'm Forrest Gimp. "\NJust run away, Forrest. Run, Forrest! Run away! Hurry! - Get the bikes!\NHurry up! Let's get him! - Come on!\N- Look out, dummy, here we come! We're gonna get you! Run, Forrest, run! Run, Forrest! Come back here, you! Run, Forrest! Run! Now, you wouldn't believe it\Nif I told you, but I can run like the wind blows. From that day on,\Nif I was going somewhere, I was running! He's getting away! Stop him! That boy sure is a running fool. Now, remember how I told you that Jenny never seemed\Nto want to go home? Well, she lived in a house\Nthat was as old as Alabama. Her mama had gone up to heaven\Nwhen she was five, and her daddy was\Nsome kind of a farmer. Jenny? He was a very loving man. He was always kissing and touching\Nher and her sisters. And then this one time,\NJenny wasn't on the bus to go to school. Jenny, why didn't you come\Nto school today? Daddy's taking a nap. Jenny!\N- Come on! Jenny, where'd you run to? You'd better get back here, girl! Where you at? Jenny! Jenny! Where you at? Jenny! Pray with me, Forrest. Pray with me. Jenny! Dear God, make me a bird\Nso I can fly far, far, far away from here. Dear God, make me a bird\Nso I can fly far, far, far away from here. Mama always said\Nthat God is mysterious. Jenny! He didn't turn Jenny into a bird that day. You'd better get back here! Instead, he had the police say Jenny didn't\Nhave to stay in that house no more. She went to live with her grandma\Njust over on Creekmore Avenue, which made me happy,\N'cause she was so close. Some nights, Jenny would sneak out\Nand come on over to my house, just 'cause she said she was scared. Scared of what, I don't know, but I think it was her grandma's dog. He was a mean dog. Anyway, Jenny and me was best friends all the way up through high school. - Hey, stupid!\N- Quit it! - Run, Forrest, run!\N- Hey, did you hear me, stupid? - Run, Forrest!\N- Come on, get in the truck! Get in the truck! Let's move it! Come on, he's getting away! Move it! Run, Forrest! Run! You better be running, stupid!\NCome on, dummy! - Haul ass, dummy!\N- Yeah, you better get running! Jack rabbit! Yeah! Go! Go! Go! Run, Forrest! Now, it used to be,\NI ran to get where I was going, I never thought it would\Ntake me anywhere. - Who in the hell is that?\N- That there is Forrest Gump, Coach. Just a local idiot. And can you believe it?\NI got to go to college, too. Forrest! Forrest! Run! - Okay!\N- Run! Run, you stupid son of a bitch! Run! You son of a bitch! Run! Go! Run! No! Turn! Go! He must be the stupidest\Nson of a bitch alive, but he sure is fast! Now, maybe it's just me,\Nbut college was very confusing times. Federal troops enforcing a court order integrated the University\Nof Alabama today. Two negroes were admitted, but only after Governor George Wallace\Nhad carried out his symbolic threat to stand in the school house door. Governor Wallace,\NI take it from that statement, that... Earl, what's going on? - Coons are trying to get into school.\N- Coons? When raccoons try to get\Non our back porch, Mama just chase them off with a broom. Not raccoons, you idiot, niggers,\Nand they want to go to school with us. With us? They do? Shortly after Governor\NWallace had carried out his promise to block the doorway, President Kennedy\Nordered the Secretary of Defense then to use military force. Here, by videotape,\Nis the encounter by General Graham, commander of the National Guard,\Nand Governor Wallace. ...because these National Guardsmen\Nare here today as federal soldiers for Alabamans. They live within our borders,\Nthey are all our brothers. We are winning in this fight, because we are awakening\Nthe American people to the dangers that we have spoken\Nabout so many times, just so evident today, the trend towards\Nmilitary dictatorship in this country. And so, at day's end,\Nthe University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa had been desegregated and students Jimmy Hood\Nand Vivian Malone had been signed up\Nfor summer classes. Ma'am, you dropped your book.\NMa'am... Governor Wallace did what\Nhe promised to do. By being on the Tuscaloosa campus,\Nhe kept the mob from gathering... Say, wasn't that Gump? - Nah, that couldn't be.\N- It sure as hell was. A few years later,\Nthat angry little man at the school house door\Nthought it would be a good idea and ran for president. But somebody thought that it wasn't. But he didn't die. My bus is here. - Is it the number nine?\N- No, it's the number four. It was nice talking to you. I remember when that happened,\Nwhen Wallace got shot. I was in college. Did you go to a girls' college, or to a girls-and-boys-together college? It was co-ed. 'Cause Jenny went to a college\NI couldn't go to. It was a college just for girls. But I'd go and visit her\Nevery chance I got. That hurts. Forrest! Forrest! - Forrest, stop it! Stop it!\NJesus! What are you doing? - He was hurting you.\N- What the hell is going on here? - No, he's not! Get over there!\N- Who is that? Who is that? - Billy, I'm sorry.\N- What the hell? - Just get away from me!\N- Don't... - Don't go! Billy, wait a second!\N- Get away from me. He doesn't know any better! Forrest, why did you do that? I brought you some chocolate. I'm sorry. - I'll go back to my college now.\N- Forrest... Look at you. Come on. Come on. - Is this your room?\N- Shh! Do you ever dream, Forrest, about who you're gonna be? - Who I'm gonna be?\N- Yeah. Aren't I going to be me? Well, you'll always be you,\Njust another kind of you. You know? I want to be famous. I want to be a singer like Joan Baez. I just want to be on an empty stage with my guitar, my voice. Just me. And I want to reach people\Non the personal level. I want to be able to say things,\Njust one-to-one. Have you ever been with a girl, Forrest? I sit next to them in my Home\NEconomics class all the time. - I'm... Sorry.\N- It's okay. It's all right. - It's okay.\N- Oh, I'm dizzy. I bet that never happened in Home Ec. No. I think I ruined\Nyour roommate's bathrobe. I don't care.\NI don't like her, anyway. Run! Run! Run! - Run! Run! Run!\N- Run! Run! Run! College ran by real fast,\N'cause I played so much football. They even put me on a thing\Ncalled the All-America Team, where you get to meet\Nthe President of the United States. President Kennedy met\Nwith the Collegiate All-American Football Team\Nat the Oval Office today. Now, the really good thing\Nabout meeting the President of the United States\Nis the food. They put you in this little room\Nwith just about anything you'd want to eat or drink. And since, number one,\NI wasn't hungry, but thirsty, and number two, they was free, I must have drank me about\N15 Dr. Peppers. Congratulations.\NHow does it feel to be an All-American? It's an honor, sir. Congratulations.\NHow does it feel to be an All-American? Very good, sir. Congratulations.\NHow does it feel to be an All-American? Very good, sir. - Congratulations. How do you feel?\N- I gotta pee. I believe he said\Nhe had to "go pee. " Sometime later,\Nfor no particular reason, somebody shot that\Nnice young President, when he was riding in his car. And a few years after that,\Nsomebody shot his little brother, too, only he was in a hotel kitchen. It must be hard being brothers. I wouldn't know. Forrest Gump. Now can you believe it? After only five years of playing football,\NI got a college degree. Congratulations, son. Mama was so proud. Forrest, I'm so proud of you.\NHere, I'll hold this for you. Congratulations, son. Have you given any thought\Nto your future? Thought? Hello, I'm Forrest. Forrest Gump. Nobody gives a hunk of shit\Nwho you are, fuzzball! You're not even a low-life,\Nscum-sucking maggot! Get your faggotty ass on the bus.\NYou're in the Army now! This seat's taken. Taken. At first, it seemed like\NI made a mistake, seeing how it was only my induction day and I was already getting yelled at. You can sit down if you want to. I didn't know who I might meet,\Nor what they might ask. You ever been on a real shrimp boat? No, but I been on a real big boat. I'm talking about\Na shrimp-catching boat. I've been working\Non shrimp boats all my life. I started out on my uncle's boat,\Nthat's my mama's brother, when I was about maybe nine. I was just looking into buying a boat\Nof my own and got drafted. My given name is Benjamin Buford Blue.\NPeople call me Bubba. Just like one of them old redneck boys.\NCan you believe that? My name's Forrest Gump.\NPeople call me Forrest Gump. So, Bubba was from\NBayou La Batre, Alabama, and his mama cooked shrimp, and her mama before her\Ncooked shrimp, and her mama before her mama\Ncooked shrimp, too. Bubba's family knew everything there was to know\Nabout the shrimping business. I know everything there is to know\Nabout the shrimping business. Matter of fact, I'm going into\Nthe shrimping business for myself after I get out the Army. Okay. Gump! What's your sole purpose\Nin this Army? To do whatever you tell me,\NDrill Sergeant! God damn it, Gump!\NYou're a goddamn genius! That's the most outstanding answer\NI've ever heard. You must have a goddamn IQ of 160! You are goddamn gifted, Private Gump! Listen up, people! Now, for some reason, I fit in\Nthe Army like one of them round pegs. It's not really hard. You just make your bed real neat\Nand remember to stand up straight, and always answer every question\Nwith, "Yes, Drill Sergeant!" Is that clear? - Yes, Drill Sergeant!\N- Yes, Drill Sergeant! What you do is, you just drag\Nyour nets along the bottom. On a good day, you can catch over\N100 pounds of shrimp. If everything goes all right,\Ntwo men shrimping 10 hours, less what you spend on gas, you can... - Done, Drill Sergeant!\N- Gump! Why did you put that weapon\Ntogether so quickly, Gump? You told me to, Drill Sergeant. Jesus H. Christ,\Nthis is a new company record. If it wouldn't be a waste\Nof such a damn fine enlisted man, I'd recommend you for OCS,\NPrivate Gump. You are gonna be\Na general some day, Gump. Now, disassemble your weapon\Nand continue! Anyway, like I was saying,\Nshrimp is the fruit of the sea. You can barbecue it,\Nboil it, broil it, bake it, sauté it. There's shrimp kebabs, shrimp Creole... ...shrimp gumbo, pan fried,\Ndeep fried, stir fried. There's pineapple shrimp,\Nlemon shrimp, coconut shrimp, pepper shrimp... ...shrimp soup, shrimp stew,\Nshrimp salad, shrimp and potatoes, shrimp burger, shrimp sandwich... That's... That's about it. Night time in the Army\Nis a lonely time. We'd lay there in our bunks\Nand I'd miss my mama. And I'd miss Jenny. Hey, Gump, get a load of the tits on her! Turns out, Jenny had gotten into\Nsome trouble over some photos of her\Nin her college sweater, and she was thrown out of school. But that wasn't a bad thing, because a man who owns\Na theater in Memphis, Tennessee, saw those photos and offered Jenny\Na job singing in a show. The first chance I got, I took the bus up to Memphis\Nto see her perform in that show. That was Amber, Amber Flame. Give her a big hand, guys.\NGood job, Amber. And now, for your listening\Nand viewing pleasure, direct from Hollywood, California,\Nour very own beatnik beauty, let's give a big round of applause\Nto the luscious Bobbi Dylan. All right!\NBobbi! Her dream had come true. She was a folk singer. Come on, baby. Shake it up.\NShake it up, now. Hey, buddy, get her a harmonica. Hey, honey,\Nthis ain't Captain Kangaroo. Hey, honey,\NI got something here for you. - God damn it!\N- Hey! Hey! Stupid jerk! I'm singing a song here. Polly, get out here! - Shut up, there!\NDon't be so shy, honey. Oh, shut up! Forrest, what are you doing here? - What are you doing?\NHey! - Come on.\N- What are you doing? Forrest, let me down! You can't keep doing this, Forrest. You can't keep trying\Nto rescue me all the time. - They was trying to grab you.\N- A lot of people try to grab me. Just... You can't keep\Ndoing this all the time. I can't help it. I love you. Forrest, you don't know what love is. You remember that time\Nwe prayed, Forrest? We prayed for God to turn me\Ninto a bird so I could fly far, far away? Yes, I do. You think I could fly off this bridge? What do you mean, Jenny? Nothing. I gotta get out of here. Wait, Jenny... Forrest, you stay away from me, okay?\NYou just stay away from me, please. Can I have a ride? Where you going?\N- I don't care. Get in the truck. So, bye-bye, Jenny. They sending me to Vietnam. It's this whole other country. Just hang on a minute. Listen, you promise me\Nsomething, okay? Just, if you're ever in trouble,\Ndon't try to be brave. You just run, okay? Just run away. Okay. Jenny. I'll write you all the time. And just like that,\Nshe was gone. You come back safe to me,\Ndo you hear? Now, they told us that Vietnam\Nwas gonna be very different from the United States of America. And except for all the beer cans\Nand the barbecue, it was. Hey, I bet there's shrimp\Nall in these waters. They tell me these Vietnams\Nis good shrimpers. You know, after we win this war,\Nand we take over everything, we can get American shrimpers to come out here\Nand shrimp these waters. We'll just shrimp all the time, man. So much shrimp, why,\Nyou wouldn't believe it. You must be my FNGs. - Morning, sir!\N- Morning, sir! Get your hands down! Do not salute me. There's goddamn snipers\Nall around this area who would love to grease an officer. I'm Lieutenant Dan Taylor.\NWelcome to Fourth Platoon. What's wrong with your lip? I was born with big gums, sir. Yeah, well, you better tuck that in.\NGonna get that caught on a trip wire. Where you boys from in the world? - Alabama, sir!\N- Alabama, sir! You twins? No, we are not relations, sir. Look, it's pretty basic here. If you stick with me\Nand learn from the guys who've been in country a while,\Nyou'll be all right. There is one item of GI gear that can be the difference between\Na live grunt and a dead grunt. Socks. Cushion sole, OD green. Try and keep your feet dry. When we're out humping,\NI want you boys to remember to change your socks whenever we stop. The Mekong will eat a grunt's feet\Nright off his legs. Sergeant Sims, God damn it, where is that sling rope\NI told you to order? I put in the requisitions at Battalion. Yeah, yeah, yeah, well,\Nyou call those sons of bitches again... Lieutenant Dan\Nsure knew his stuff. I felt real lucky he was my lieutenant. He was from a long,\Ngreat military tradition. Somebody in his family\Nhad fought and died in every single American war. - God damn it, kick some ass!\N- I'm on it, Lieutenant. Get on it! I guess you could say he had\Na lot to live up to. So, you boys are from Arkansas, huh?\NWell, I've been through there. Little Rock's a fine town. Now, go shake down your gear,\Nsee the platoon sergeant, draw what you need for the field. If you boys are hungry,\Nwe got steaks burning right over here. Two standing orders in this platoon: One, take good care of your feet, two, try not to do anything stupid,\Nlike getting yourself killed. I sure hope I don't let him down. I got to see\Na lot of the countryside. We would take these real long walks. And we were always looking\Nfor this guy named Charlie. Hold it up!\NHold up, boys! It wasn't always fun. Lieutenant Dan was always getting\Nthese funny feelings about a rock, or a trail, or the road,\Nso he'd tell us to get down, shut up... Get down! Shut up! ...so we did. Now, I don't know much about anything, but I think some of America's\Nbest young men served in this war. There was Dallas, from Phoenix, Cleveland, he was from Detroit. Hey, Tex. Hey, Tex. Man, what the hell's going on? And Tex was... Well, I don't remember\Nwhere Tex come from. Nothing. Fourth Platoon, on your feet. Still got 10 klicks to go to that river.\NMove out. Come on, move out. Step it up. Look alive out there. The good thing about Vietnam\Nis there was always some place to go. Fire in the hole! Gump, check out that hole. And there was always something to do. - Mount them up.\NSpread out! Cover his back. One day, it started raining,\Nand it didn't quit for four months. We'd been through\Nevery kind of rain there is: Little bitty stinging rain, and big old fat rain, rain that flew in sideways. And sometimes, rain even seemed\Nto come straight up from underneath. Shoot, it even rained at night. - Hey, Forrest.\N- Hey, Bubba. I'm gonna lean up against you.\NYou just lean right back against me. This way, we don't have to sleep\Nwith our heads in the mud. You know why we a good partnership,\NForrest? 'Cause we be watching out\Nfor one another, like brothers and stuff. Hey, Forrest, there's something\NI've been thinking about. I got a very important question\Nto ask you. How would you like to go\Ninto the shrimping business with me? Okay. Man, I tell you what,\NI got it all figured out, too. So many pounds of shrimp\Nto pay off the boat, so many pounds for gas,\Nwe can just live right on the boat. We ain't got to pay no rent. I'll be the captain,\Nwe can just work it together, split everything right down the middle.\NMan, I'm telling you, 50-50. And, hey, Forrest,\Nall the shrimp you can eat. That's a fine idea. Bubba did have a fine idea. I even wrote Jenny\Nand told her all about it. I sent her letters,\Nnot every day, but almost. I told her what I was doing\Nand asked her what she was doing, and told her\Nhow I thought about her always, and how I was looking forward\Nto getting a letter from her just as soon as she had the time. I'd always let her know that I was okay. Then, I'd sign each letter,\N"Love, Forrest Gump. " This one day, we was out walking,\Nlike always, and then, just like that, somebody turned off the rain\Nand the sun come out. Ambush! Take cover! Get down! Get the sixty! Get that pig up here, God damn it! Forrest, you okay? Strongarm! Strongarm!\NBe advised, Strongarm! Medic, we got a man down! Strongarm, this is Leg Lima 6, over! Roger, Strongarm, be advised\Nwe have incoming from the tree line at points blue plus two.\NAKs and rockets... Misfire! Misfire! God damn it! Mac! Get that thing...\NFuck it, get it in the tree line! Jesus! My unit is down hard and hurting! Six are pulling back to Blue Line,\NLeg Lima 6 out. Pull back! Pull back! Run! Run, Forrest! - Pull back!\NForrest, Forrest! Run, man! Run! Pull back! Run! Run, God damn it, run! Medic! Can I get a medic? I ran and ran,\Njust like Jenny told me to. I ran so far and so fast\Nthat pretty soon I was all by myself, which was a bad thing. Bubba! Bubba was my best good friend.\NI had to make sure that he was okay. Any friendlies out there? Yeah, I've got\Nthree over here. Where the hell are you? Bubba? And on my way back to find Bubba, well, there was this boy\Nlaying on the ground. Tex! Okay. I couldn't just let him lay there all alone,\Nscared the way he was, so I grabbed him up\Nand run him out of there. And every time I went back\Nlooking for Bubba, somebody else was saying,\N"Help me, Forrest. Help me. " Can't hear... Can't hear... No sweat, man. Just lay back. You'll be okay. You'll be okay. I started to get scared\Nthat I might never find Bubba. Over. Roger, Strongarm,\NI know my position is danger close. We got Charlie all over this area. I gotta have those fast movers\Nin here now. Over. - Six, Strongarm, we want...\N- Lieutenant Dan, Coleman's dead! I know he's dead! My whole goddamn platoon\Nis wiped out! - Leg Lima 6, Leg Lima 6.\N- God damn it! - Copy this transmission. Over.\N- What are you doing? Just leave me here! Get away.\NJust leave me here! Get out! Leg Lima 6, Strongarm.\NHow copy this? Over. God, I said leave me here, God damn it! Leg Lima 6, Leg Lima 6,\Nthis is Strongarm, be advised your fast movers\Nare inbound at this time, over. Then, it felt like something\Njust jumped up and bit me. Something bit me! You chink son of a bitch! I can't leave the platoon. I told you to leave me there, Gump.\NForget about me. Get yourself out! Did you hear what I said? God damn it, put me down! Get your ass out of here! I didn't ask you to pull me out of there,\NGod damn you! Where the hell\Ndo you think you're going? To get Bubba. I got an air strike inbound right now.\NThey're gonna nape the whole area. Gump, you stay here, God damn it!\NThat's an order! I gotta find Bubba! Forrest. - Bubba.\N- I'm okay, Forrest. I'm okay. Oh, Bubba, no... Nah, I'm gonna be all right. Come on. Come on. Come on. I'm okay, Forrest. I'm okay, man. I'm fine. Helo's inbound.\NTop smoke, get it out there! If I'd a known this was gonna be the\Nlast time me and Bubba was gonna talk, I'd of thought of something better to say. Hey, Bubba. Hey, Forrest. Forrest, why'd this happen? You got shot. Then Bubba said something\NI won't ever forget. I wanna go home. Bubba was my best good friend. And even I know that ain't something\Nyou can find just around the corner. Bubba was gonna be\Na shrimping boat captain, but instead he died right there\Nby that river in Vietnam. That's all I have to say about that. It was a bullet, wasn't it? - A bullet?\N- That jumped up and bit you. Oh, yes, sir. Bit me directly in the buttocks. They said it was a million-dollar wound,\Nbut the Army must keep that money, 'cause I still ain't seen a nickel\Nof that million dollars. The only good thing\Nabout being wounded in the buttocks is the ice cream. They gave me all the ice cream\NI could eat. And guess what? A good friend of mine\Nwas in the bed right next door. Lieutenant Dan,\NI got you some ice cream. Lieutenant Dan, ice cream. It's time for your bath, Lieutenant. Harper! Cooper, Larson, Webster, - Gump. Gump.\N- I'm Forrest Gump. Kyle, Nichols, McMill, Johnson, Tyler, Holiday... Surprise, surprise, surprise! Gump, how can you watch\Nthat stupid shit? - From the DMZ to the Delta...\N- Turn it off! ...you are tuned to the\NAmerican Forces Vietnam Network. This is Channel 6, Saigon. Good catch, Gump. You know how to play this? Come on, let me show you. Here. Now, the secret to this game is, no matter what happens,\Nnever ever take your eye off the ball. All right. For some reason,\NPing-Pong came very natural to me. See? Any idiot can play. So, I started playing it all the time. I played Ping-Pong even when I didn't have anyone\Nto play Ping-Pong with. The hospital's people said\Nit made me look like a duck in water, whatever that means. Even Lieutenant Dan would come\Nand watch me play. I played Ping-Pong so much,\NI even played it in my sleep. Now, you listen to me.\NWe all have a destiny. Nothing just happens,\Nit's all part of a plan. I should have died out there\Nwith my men, but now I'm nothing\Nbut a goddamn cripple, a legless freak! Look! Look! Look at me! Do you see that? Do you know what it's like\Nnot to be able to use your legs? Yes, sir, I do. Did you hear what I said? You cheated me. I had a destiny. I was supposed to die in the field,\Nwith honor! That was my destiny,\Nand you cheated me out of it! Do you understand\Nwhat I'm saying, Gump? This wasn't supposed to happen,\Nnot to me. I had a destiny. I was Lieutenant Dan Taylor. You're still Lieutenant Dan. Look at me. What am I gonna do now? PFC Gump? Yes, sir! As you were. Son, you've been awarded\Nthe Medal of Honor. Guess what, Lieutenant Dan,\Nthey want to give me a... Ma'am, what'd they do\Nwith Lieutenant Dan? They sent him home. Two weeks later, I left Vietnam. The ceremony was kicked off\Nwith a candid speech by the President regarding the need for further escalation\Nof the war in Vietnam. President Johnson awarded\Nfour Medals of Honor to men\Nfrom each of the Armed Services. America owes you\Na debt of gratitude, son. I understand you were wounded.\NWhere were you hit? - In the buttocks, sir.\N- That must be a sight. I'd kind of like to see that. God damn, son. After that,\NMama went to the hotel to lay down, so I went out for a walk\Nto see our nation's capital. Hilary, all right,\NI've got the vets, what do you want me to do with them? What are you doing here\Nso late? It's a good thing Mama was resting,\N'cause the streets was awful crowded with people looking\Nat all the statues and monuments, and some of them people were loud\Nand pushy. Okay, follow me! Come on.\NLet's move it out. Everywhere I went,\NI had to stand in line. Follow me, let's go! Come on. Let's go. Stand here. Hey, you're a good man\Nfor doing this. Good! Okay. There was this man giving a little talk. And for some reason, he was\Nwearing an American flag for a shirt. Now, I'm gonna\Nbring up some soldiers... And he liked to say the "F" word. A lot. "F" this and "F" that. And every time he said the "F" word, people, for some reason,\Nwell, they'd cheer. ...where to stick this fucking war! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Come on, man, come up here, man. Come on. Come on. Yeah, you!\NCome on. Move, move, move. You can do it. Just get up there.\NGo on. That's it. Tell us a little bit about the war, man. The war in Vietnam? - The war in Viet-fucking-nam!\N- Yeah! Peace! Come on, man, go! Come on!\NPeace! Well... There was only one thing\NI could say about the war in Vietnam. ...there's only one thing\NI can say about the war in Vietnam. In Vietnam, your... Hey, what the hell are you... I'll beat your head in,\Nyou goddamn oinker! Jesus Christ, what'd they do with this? We can't hear you! We can't hear anything! - This one! This one! Give me that!\NTurn it up! Speak up! That's it! ...and that's all I have to say about that. That's so right on, man. You said it all. What's your name, man? My name is Forrest. Forrest Gump. Forrest Gump! - Gump!\N- Gump! Forrest! Forrest! - Jenny!\N- Forrest! Hey! Hey! It was the happiest moment of my life. Jenny and me were just like\Npeas and carrots again. She showed me around, and even introduced me\Nto some of her new friends. Shut that blind, man. And get your white ass\Naway from that window. Don't you know we in a war here? Hey, man, he's cool. He's cool.\NHe's one of us. - Let me tell you about us.\N- Where the hell have you been? Our purpose here\Nis to protect our black leaders from the racial onslaught of the pig who wishes to brutalize\Nour black leaders, rape our women,\Nand destroy our black communities. Who's the baby killer? This is my good friend I told you about.\NThis is Forrest Gump. Forrest, this is Wesley. Wesley and I lived together in Berkeley, and he's the president\Nof the Berkeley chapter of SDS. Let me tell you something else. We are here to offer protection and help\Nfor all of those who need our help, because we, the Black Panthers,\Nare against the war in Vietnam. Yes, we are against any war where\Nblack soldiers are sent to the frontline to die for a country that hates them. Yes, we are against any war\Nwhere black soldiers go to fight and come to be brutalized and killed\Nin their own communities as they sleep in their beds at night. You are a fucking asshole! Yes, we are against all these racist\Nand imperial dog acts. Forrest! Quit it! Quit it! Forrest! Stop it! Stop it! Oh, God... I shouldn't have brought you here. I should have known it was just\Ngonna be some bullshit hassle. He should not be hitting you, Jenny. Come on, Forrest. Sorry I had a fight in the middle\Nof your Black Panther party. He doesn't mean it when\Nhe does things like this. He doesn't. I would never hurt you, Jenny. I know you wouldn't, Forrest. I wanted to be your boyfriend. That uniform is a trip, Forrest. You look handsome in it. You do. - You know what?\N- What? I'm glad we were here together\Nin our nation's capital. Me, too, Forrest. We walked around all night,\NJenny and me, just talking. She told me about\Nall the traveling she'd done. And how she'd discovered ways\Nto expand her mind and learn how to live in harmony, which must be out west somewhere, 'cause she made it\Nall the way to California. Try to love one another right now Hey! Anybody want to go to San Francisco? - I'll go.\N- Far out. It was a very special night\Nfor the two of us. I didn't want it to end. I wish you wouldn't go, Jenny. I have to, Forrest. Jenny? Things got a little out of hand. It's just this war\Nand that lying son of a bitch, Johnson! I would never hurt you, you know that. You know what I think? I think you should go home\Nto Greenbow, Alabama! Forrest, we have very different lives,\Nyou know. I want you to have this. Forrest, I can't keep this. I got it just by doing\Nwhat you told me to do. Why are you so good to me? You're my girl. I'll always be your girl. And just like that,\Nshe was gone, out of my life again. That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind. I thought I was\Ngoing back to Vietnam, but instead, they decided the best way\Nfor me to fight the Communists was to play Ping-Pong. So, I was in the Special Services, traveling around the country\Ncheering up all them wounded veterans and showing them\Nhow to play Ping-Pong. I was so good that some years later the Army decided that I should be\Non the All-American Ping-Pong team. We were the first Americans\Nto visit the land of China in like a million years,\Nor something like that. Somebody said world peace\Nwas in our hands, but all I did was play Ping-Pong. When I got home,\NI was a national celebrity. Famouser even than Captain Kangaroo. Here he is, Forrest Gump, right here. Mr. Gump, have a seat. Forrest Gump, John Lennon. - Welcome home.\N- You had quite a trip. Can you tell us, what was China like? In the land of China,\Npeople hardly got nothing at all. No possessions? And in China, they never go to church. No religion, too? Oh. - Hard to imagine.\N- Well, it's easy if you try, Dick. Some years later,\Nthat nice young man from England was on his way home\Nto see his little boy and was signing some autographs, and for no particular reason at all,\Nsomebody shot him. They gave you\Nthe Congressional Medal of Honor. Now, that's Lieutenant Dan. Lieutenant Dan! They gave you\Nthe Congressional Medal of Honor! Yes, sir, they surely did. They gave you, an imbecile,\Na moron who goes on television and makes a fool out of himself\Nin front of the whole damn country, the Congressional Medal of Honor. Yes, sir. Well, then, that's just perfect! Yeah, well,\NI just got one thing to say to that. God damn bless America. Hey! Oh, God! - Oh, God!\N- Lieutenant Dan! Lieutenant Dan said\Nhe was living in a hotel. And because he didn't have no legs, he spent most of his time\Nexercising his arms. Take a right. Take a right. Hey! Come on, already! What do you do here in New York,\NLieutenant Dan? I'm living off the government tit. Sucking it dry! Hey! Hey! Hey! Are you blind? - I'm walking here!\N- Get out of the way! Get out! Come on, go! Go! Go! I stayed with Lieutenant Dan\Nand celebrated the holidays. You have a great year.\NHurry home and God bless you. Have you found Jesus yet, Gump? I didn't know I was supposed to be\Nlooking for him, sir. That's all these cripples,\Ndown at the VA, that's all they ever talk about. Jesus this and Jesus that. Have I found Jesus? They even had a priest come\Nand talk to me. He said God is listening,\Nbut I have to help myself. How if I accept Jesus into my heart, I'll get to walk beside him\Nin the kingdom of heaven. Did you hear what I said? Walk beside him\Nin the kingdom of heaven. Well, kiss my crippled ass. God is listening? What a crock of shit. I'm going to heaven, Lieutenant Dan. Oh? Well, before you go, why don't you get\Nyour ass down to the corner - and get us another bottle of Ripple.\N- Yes, sir. We are at approximately 45th Street\Nin New York City at One Astor Plaza. This is the site of the old Astor Hotel. What the hell\Nis in Bayou La Batre? Shrimping boats.\NShrimping boats? Who gives a shit\Nabout shrimping boats? I gotta buy me\None of them shrimping boats, soon as I have some money. I made me a promise to Bubba\Nin Vietnam that as soon as the war was over,\Nwe'd go in partners. He'd be the captain of the\Nshrimping boat and I'd be his first mate. But now that he's dead,\Nthat means I gotta be the captain. - A shrimp boat captain.\N- Yes, sir. A promise is a promise, Lieutenant Dan. Now hear this! Private Gump here\Nis gonna be a shrimp boat captain. Well, I tell you what, Gilligan, the day that you are\Na shrimp boat captain, - I will come and be your first mate.\N- Okay. If you're ever a shrimp boat captain,\Nthat's the day I'm an astronaut. Danny, what are you\Ncomplaining about? - What are you doing, hon?\N- Mr. Hot Wheels. - Who's your friend?\N- My name is Forrest, Forrest Gump. This is Cunning Carla\Nand Long-Limbs Lenore. So, where you been, baby cakes, huh?\NHaven't seen you around lately. You know, you should have\Nbeen here for Christmas, 'cause Tommy bought a round\Non the house and gave everybody a turkey sandwich. Well, well, I had company. Hey, hey! We was just there.\NThat's at Times Square. Don't you just love New Year's?\NYou get to start all over. Hey, Lenore...\N- Everybody gets a second chance. It's funny,\Nbut in the middle of all that fun, I began to think about Jenny, wondering how she was spending\Nher New Year's night out in California. Eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one! Happy New Year! Happy New Year, Lieutenant Dan! What are you, stupid or something?\NWhat's your problem? What's his problem? Did you lose your pecker in the war\Nor something? What, is your friend stupid\Nor something? What did you say? I said, is your friend stupid\Nor something? Hey! Don't call him stupid! Hey, don't you push her!\NYou shut up! - Don't you ever call him stupid!\NWhat's the matter, baby? - Why are you so upset?\NJust get the hell out of here. - Stupid damn...\N- Get your goddamn clothes... You belong in Ripley's Believe It Or Not! - Get the hell out of here!\N- You should be in a sideshow! Go on! Get out of here! Come on, Lenore.\NWe don't need this shit! Get out of here! - You retard.\N- Loser. You freak. No, no. I'm sorry I ruined your\NNew Year's Eve party, Lieutenant Dan. She tasted like cigarettes. I guess Lieutenant Dan figured there's some things\Nyou just can't change. He didn't want to be called crippled,\Njust like I didn't want to be called stupid. Happy New Year, Gump. The US Ping-Pong team met with President Nixon today\Nat an Oval Office ceremony... And wouldn't you know it?\NA few months later, they invited me and the Ping-Pong team\Nto visit the White House. So, I went, again. And I met the President\Nof the United States, again. Only, this time, they didn't get us rooms\Nin a real fancy hotel. So, are you enjoying yourself\Nin our nation's capital, young man? - Yes, sir.\N- Well, where are you staying? - It's called the Hotel Ebbott.\N- Oh, no, no, no, no. I know of a much nicer hotel.\NIt's brand-new, very modern. I'll have my people\Ntake care of it for you. Security, Frank Wills. Yeah, sir, you might want\Nto send a maintenance man over to that office across the way. The lights are off, and they must be\Nlooking for a fuse box or something, 'cause them flashlights,\Nthey're keeping me awake. Okay, sir. I'll check it out. - Thank you.\N- No problem. - Good night.\N- Good night. Therefore, I shall resign the presidency\Neffective at noon tomorrow. Vice President Ford will be sworn in as president\Nat that hour in this office. As I recall the high hopes for America\Nwith which we began this second term... Sergeant Gump. - Yes, sir!\N- As you were. I have your discharge papers.\NYour service is up, son. Does this mean\NI can't play Ping-Pong no more? For the Army it does. And just like that, my service\Nin the United States Army was over. So, I went home. - I'm home, Mama.\N- I know, I know. - Louise, he's here.\NNow, when I got home, I had no idea,\Nbut Mama had had all sorts of visitors. We've had all sorts of visitors, Forrest. Everybody wants you\Nto use their Ping-Pong stuff. One man even left a check for $25,000 if you'd be agreeable to saying\Nyou liked using their paddle. Oh, but, Mama,\NI only like using my own paddle. - Hi, Miss Louise.\N- Hey, Forrest. I know that. I know that. But it's $25,000, Forrest. I thought maybe you could hold it\Nfor a while, see if it grows on you. - Oh, you look good, Forrest.\N- That Mama, she sure was right. - You look real good.\N- It's funny how things work out. I didn't stay home for long,\Nbecause I'd made a promise to Bubba, and I always try to keep my promise. So, I went on down to Bayou La Batre to meet Bubba's family\Nand make their introduction. Are you crazy, or just plain stupid? Stupid is as stupid does, Mrs. Blue. I guess. And, of course,\NI paid my respect to Bubba himself. Hey, Bubba, it's me, Forrest Gump. I remember everything you said,\Nand I got it all figured out. I'm taking the $24,562\Nand 47 cents that I got... Or, that's left after a new hair cut\Nand a new suit, and I took Mama out\Nto a real fancy dinner, and I bought a bus ticket\Nand three Dr. Peppers. Tell me something. Are you stupid\Nor something? Stupid is as stupid does, sir. Well, that's what's left after me saying, "When I was in China\Non the All-America Ping-Pong team, "I just loved playing Ping-Pong with\Nmy Flex-O-Light Ping-Pong paddle," which everybody knows isn't true, but Mama says it's just a little white lie so it wouldn't hurt nobody. So, anyway, I'm putting all that on gas,\Nropes and new nets and a brand-new shrimping boat. Now, Bubba had told me everything\Nhe knew about shrimping, but you know what I found out? Shrimping is tough. I only caught five. A couple more,\Nyou could have yourself a cocktail. Hey, you ever think\Nabout naming this old boat? It's bad luck\Nto have a boat without a name. I'd never named a boat before,\Nbut there was only one I could think of, the most beautiful name\Nin the wide world. Now, I hadn't heard from Jenny\Nin a long while, but I thought about her a lot, and I hoped that whatever\Nshe was doing made her happy. I thought about Jenny all the time. Hey! Lieutenant Dan,\Nwhat are you doing here? Well, thought I'd try out my sea legs. But you ain't got no legs,\NLieutenant Dan. Yes, I know that. You wrote me a letter, you idiot. Well, well. Captain Forrest Gump.\NI had to see this for myself. And I told you if you were ever\Na shrimp boat captain that I'd be your first mate.\NWell, here I am. - I am a man of my word.\N- Okay. Yeah, but don't you be thinking that\NI'm going to be calling you "sir. " No, sir. That's my boat. I have a feeling if we head\Ndue east, we'll find some shrimp, so take a left. - Take a left!\N- Which way? Over there! They're over there! - Get on the wheel and take a left!\N- Okay. Gump, what are you doing?\NTake a left! Left! That's where we're going\Nto find those shrimp, my boy! That's where we'll find them. - Still no shrimp, Lieutenant Dan.\N- Okay, so I was wrong. How are we going to find them? Well, maybe you should\Njust pray for shrimp. So, I went to church every Sunday. Sometimes Lieutenant Dan came, too, though I think\Nhe left the praying up to me. - No shrimp.\N- Where the hell's this God of yours? It's funny Lieutenant Dan said that,\N'cause right then, God showed up. You'll never sink this boat!\N- Now, me, I was scared, but Lieutenant Dan, he was mad. Come on! You call this a storm?\NCome on, you son of a bitch! It's time for a showdown! You and me! I'm right here! Come and get me! You'll never sink this boat! Hurricane Carmen\Ncame through here yesterday, destroying nearly everything in its path. And as in other towns\Nup and down the coast, Bayou La Batre's\Nentire shrimping industry has fallen victim to Carmen\Nand has been left in utter ruin. Speaking with local officials,\Nthis reporter has learned, in fact, only one shrimping boat\Nactually survived the storm. Louise. Louise, there's Forrest. After that,\Nshrimping was easy. Since people still needed\Nthem shrimps for shrimp cocktails and barbecues and all,\Nand we were the only boat left standing, Bubba-Gump Shrimp's what they got. We got a whole bunch of boats,\N12 Jennys, a big old warehouse. We even have\Nhats that say "Bubba-Gump" on them. Bubba-Gump Shrimp.\NIt's a household name. Hold on there, boy. Are you telling me you're the owner of\Nthe Bubba-Gump Shrimp Corporation? Yes, sir. We got more money\Nthan Davy Crockett. Boy, I heard some whoppers in my time,\Nbut that tops them all. We was sitting next to a millionaire. Well, I thought it was a very lovely story, and you tell it so well,\Nwith such enthusiasm. Would you like to see\Nwhat Lieutenant Dan looks like? Well, yes, I would. That's him right there. And let me tell you something\Nabout Lieutenant Dan... Forrest, I never thanked you for saving my life. He never actually said so,\Nbut I think he made his peace with God. For the second time in 17 days, President Ford escaped\Npossible assassination today. Base to Jenny 1. - Base to Jenny 1.\N- Jenny 1. Go, Margo. Forrest has a phone call. Yeah, well, you'll have to tell them\Nto call him back. - He is indisposed at the moment.\N- His mama's sick. - Where's Mama?\N- She's upstairs. Hi, Forrest. I'll see you tomorrow.\N- All right. We sure got you straightened out,\Ndidn't we, boy? - What's the matter, Mama?\N- I'm dying, Forrest. Come on in, sit down over here. - Why are you dying, Mama?\N- It's my time. It's just my time. Now, don't you be afraid, sweetheart. Death is just a part of life, something we're all destined to do. I didn't know it,\Nbut I was destined to be your mama. - I did the best I could.\N- You did good, Mama. Well, I happen to believe\Nyou make your own destiny. You have to do the best\Nwith what God gave you. What's my destiny, Mama? You're going to have\Nto figure that out for yourself. Life is a box of chocolates, Forrest. You never know\Nwhat you're going to get. Mama always had a way of explaining\Nthings so I could understand them. I will miss you, Forrest. She had got the cancer\Nand died on a Tuesday. I bought her a new hat\Nwith little flowers on it. And that's all I have to say about that. Didn't you say you were waiting\Nfor the number seven bus? There'll be another one along shortly. Now, because I had been a football star,\Nand a war hero, and a national celebrity,\Nand a shrimping boat captain, and a college graduate,\Nthe city fathers of Greenbow, Alabama decided to get together\Nand offered me a fine job. So, I never went back to work\Nfor Lieutenant Dan, though he did take care\Nof my Bubba-Gump money. He got me invested\Nin some kind of fruit company. And so then, I got a call from him saying we don't have to worry about money\Nno more, and I said, "That's good. One less thing. " Now, Mama said there's only\Nso much fortune a man really needs, and the rest is just for showing off. So, I gave a whole bunch of it\Nto the Foursquare gospel church, and I gave a whole bunch to the\NBayou La Batre fishing hospital. And even though Bubba was dead\Nand Lieutenant Dan said I was nuts, I gave Bubba's mama Bubba's share. You know what? She didn't have to work\Nin nobody's kitchen no more. That smells wonderful. And 'cause I was a gazillionaire\Nand I liked doing it so much, I cut that grass for free. But at night time\Nwhen there was nothing to do and the house was all empty, I'd always think of Jenny. And then, she was there. - Hello, Forrest.\N- Hello, Jenny. Jenny came back and stayed with me. Maybe it was because\Nshe had nowhere else to go, or maybe it was because she was\Nso tired, 'cause she went to bed and slept and slept,\Nlike she hadn't slept in years. It was wonderful having her home. Every day we'd take a walk and\NI'd jabber on like a monkey in a tree, and she'd listen about Ping-Ponging,\Nand shrimping, and Mama making a trip up to heaven.\NI did all the talking. Jenny most of the time was real quiet. How could you do this? Sometimes I guess there\Njust aren't enough rocks. I never really knew why she came back,\Nbut I didn't care. It was like olden times.\NWe was like peas and carrots again. Every day, I'd pick pretty flowers\Nand put them in her room for her, and she gave me the best gift anyone\Ncould ever get in the wide world. - New shoes.\N- They make them just for running. And she even showed me how to dance. And, well, we was like family,\NJenny and me. And it was the happiest time in my life. And this Fourth is\Nwitnessing one of the largest fireworks displays\Nin the nation's... - You done watching it?\N... here in New York Harbor... - I'm going to bed.\N... with a spectacular display of tall ships earlier.\NThe Statue of Liberty... Will you marry me? I'd make a good husband, Jenny. You would, Forrest. But you won't marry me. You don't want to marry me. Why don't you love me, Jenny? I'm not a smart man, but I know what love is. Jenny. Forrest, I do love you. - Where are you running off to?\N- I'm not running. That day, for no particular reason,\NI decided to go for a little run. So, I ran to the end of the road,\Nand when I got there, I thought maybe I'd run\Nto the end of town. President Carter, suffering from heat exhaustion,\Nfell into the arms of... And when I got there, I thought maybe I'd just\Nrun across Greenbow County. And I figured since I'd run this far, maybe I'd just run across\Nthe great state of Alabama. And that's what I did. I ran clear across Alabama. For no particular reason,\NI just kept on going. I ran clear to the ocean. And when I got there,\NI figured since I'd gone this far, might as well turn around\Nand just keep on going. And when I got to another ocean,\NI figured since I'd gone this far, I might as well just turn back\Nand keep right on going. When I got tired, I slept.\NWhen I got hungry, I ate. When I had to go, you know... I went. And so, you just ran. Yeah. I'd think a lot about Mama\Nand Bubba and Lieutenant Dan. But most of all, I thought about Jenny. I thought about her a lot. For more than two years now,\Na man named Forrest Gump, a gardener from Greenbow, Alabama,\Nstopping only to sleep, has been running across America. Charles Cooper brings us this report. For the fourth time\Non his journey across America, Forrest Gump,\Nthe gardener from Greenbow, Alabama, is about to cross\Nthe Mississippi River again today. - I'll be damned. Forrest?\N- Sir, why are you running? Why are you running? Are you doing this for world peace? Are you doing this for the homeless? - Are you running for women's rights?\N- Or for the environment? Or for animals? They just couldn't believe\Nthat somebody would do all that running for no particular reason. Why are you doing this? I just felt like running. It's you. I can't believe it's really you. Now, for some reason, what I was doing\Nseemed to make sense to people. I mean, it was like an alarm\Nwent off in my head, you know? I said,\N"Here's a guy that's got his act together. "Here's somebody\Nwho's got it all figured out. "Here's somebody who has the answer. "\NI'll follow you anywhere, Mr. Gump. So, I got company. And after that, I got more company.\NAnd then, even more people joined in. Somebody later told me\Nit gave people hope. Now... Now, I don't know\Nanything about that, but some of those people\Nasked me if I could help them out. Hey, man, hey, listen, I was wondering\Nif you might help me, huh? Listen, I'm in the\Nbumper sticker business and I've been trying\Nto think up a good slogan. And since you have been such a big\Ninspiration to the people around here, I thought you might\Nbe able to help me jump into... Whoa, man! You just ran through\Na big pile of dog shit! - It happens.\N- What, shit? Sometimes. And some years later,\NI heard that that fellow did come up with\Na bumper sticker slogan, and he made a lot of money off of it. Another time, I was running along, somebody who had lost all his money\Nin the T-shirt business, he wanted to put my face on a T-shirt, but he couldn't draw that well,\Nand he didn't have a camera. Here, use this one.\NNobody likes that color anyway. Have a nice day. Well, some years later, I found out that that man\Ndid come up with an idea for a T-shirt. He made a lot of money off of it. Anyway, like I was saying,\NI had a lot of company. My mama always said, "You got to put the past behind you\Nbefore you can move on. " And I think that's what\Nmy running was all about. I had run for three years, two months, 14 days and 16 hours. Quiet. Quiet.\NHe's going to say something. I'm pretty tired. Think I'll go home now. Now what are we supposed to do? And just like that,\Nmy running days was over. So, I went home to Alabama. Moments ago, at 2:25 p. m.,\Nas President Reagan was leaving the... ...five or six gunshots were fired\Nby an unknown would-be assassin. The President was shot in the chest,\Nand the assailant... I picked up the mail. And one day, out of the blue clear sky,\NI got a letter from Jenny, wondering if I could come down\Nto Savannah and see her, and that's what I'm doing here. She saw me on TV, running. I'm supposed to go on the\Nnumber nine bus to Richmond Street and get off and go one block left\Nto 1947 Henry Street, Apartment 4. Why, you don't need to take a bus. Henry Street is just five\Nor six blocks down that way. - Down that way?\N- Down that way. It was nice talking to you. I hope everything works out for you! Hey! Forrest! How you doing? Come in, come in! I got your letter. I was wondering about that. Is this your house? Yeah. It's messy right now.\NI just got off work. It's nice. You got air conditioning. - Thank you.\N- I ate some. Hey, I kept a scrapbook\Nof your clippings and everything. There you are. And this, I got you running. I ran a long way, for a long time. And there... Listen, Forrest,\NI don't know how to say this. I just I want to apologize\Nfor anything that I ever did to you, 'cause I was messed up\Nfor a long time, and... Yoo-hoo! - Hey.\N- Hi. Hey, you. - This is an old friend from Alabama.\N- How do you do? Listen, next week my schedule\Nchanges, so I'll be able to... But thanks... No problem. Got to go, Jen,\NI'm double-parked. - Okay. Thanks.\N- Bye. This is my very good friend, Mr. Gump.\NCan you say hi to him? - Hello, Mr. Gump.\N- Hello. - Can I go watch TV now?\N- Yes, you can. Just keep it low. - You're a mama, Jenny.\N- I'm a mama. His name's Forrest. Like me. I named him after his daddy. He got a daddy named Forrest, too? You're his daddy, Forrest. Hey. Forrest, look at me. Look at me, Forrest. There's nothing you need to do, okay?\NYou didn't do anything wrong. Okay? Isn't he beautiful? He's the most beautiful thing\NI've ever seen. But... Is he smart, or... He's very smart.\NHe's one of the smartest in his class. Yeah, it's okay. Go talk to him. - What are you watching?\N- Bert and Ernie. Forrest, I'm sick. What, do you have\Na cough due to a cold? I have some kind of virus, and the doctors don't...\NThey don't know what it is, and there isn't anything\Nthey can do about it. You could come home with me. Jenny, you and little Forrest could\Ncome stay at my house in Greenbow. I'll take care of you if you're sick. Would you marry me, Forrest? Okay. Please take your seats. Forrest? It's time to start. Hi. Your tie. Lieutenant Dan. Hello, Forrest. You got new legs. New legs! Yeah. I got new legs. Custom-made. Titanium alloy.\NIt's what they use on the space shuttle. Magic legs. This is my fiancée, Susan. - Lieutenant Dan.\N- Hi, Forrest. Lieutenant Dan, this is my Jenny. Hey. It's nice to meet you finally. Do you, Forrest,\Ntake Jenny to be your wife? Do you, Jenny,\Ntake Forrest to be your husband? And so I pronounce you man and wife. - Hey.\N- Hey. Hey, Forrest. Were you scared in Vietnam? Yes. Well, I... I don't know. Sometimes it would stop raining long\Nenough for the stars to come out. And then it was nice. It was like just before the sun\Ngoes to bed down on the bayou. There was always\Na million sparkles on the water. Like that mountain lake.\NIt was so clear, Jenny, it looked like there were two skies,\None on top of the other. And then, in the desert,\Nwhen the sun comes up, I couldn't tell where heaven stopped and the earth began. It was so beautiful. I wish I could've been there with you. You were. I love you. You died on a Saturday morning. And I had you placed\Nhere under our tree. And I had that house of your father's\Nbulldozed to the ground. Mama always said that dying was a part of life. I sure wish it wasn't. Little Forrest is doing just fine. But... About to start school again soon, and I make his breakfast, lunch\Nand dinner every day. I make sure he combs his hair\Nand brushes his teeth every day. Teaching him how to play Ping-Pong. Okay. He's really good. Forrest, you go. We fish a lot. And every night, we read\Na book. He's so smart, Jenny. You'd be so proud of him. I am. He wrote you a letter. And he says I can't read it. I'm not supposed to,\Nso I'll just leave it here for you. Jenny, I don't know if Mama was right, or if it's Lieutenant Dan. I don't know if we each have a destiny, or if we're all just floating around\Naccidental-like on a breeze. But I think maybe it's both. Maybe both is happening\Nat the same time. But I miss you, Jenny. If there's anything you need,\NI won't be far away. Here's your bus. Okay. Hey. I know this. I'm gonna show that\Nfor show-and-tell because Grandma used to read it to you. My favorite book. Here we are. Okay. Here you go. Hey, Forrest, don't... - I wanted to tell you, I love you.\N- I love you, too, Daddy. I'll be right here when you get back. You understand this is\Nthe bus to school, now, don't you? Of course, and you are Dorothy Harris,\Nand I'm Forrest Gump.
