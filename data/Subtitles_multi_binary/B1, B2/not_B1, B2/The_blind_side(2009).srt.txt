[CROWD CHEERING IN DISTANCE] LElGH ANNE: There's a moment oforderly\Nsilence before a football play begins. Players are in position, linemen\Nare frozen, and anything is possible. ANNOUNCER [ON TV]: Almost Indian-summer\Nweather here in mid-November. [WHlSTLE BLOWS] LElGH ANNE: Then, like a traffic accident,\Nstuff begins to randomly collide. From the snap of the ball\Nto the snap of the first bone... ...is closer to four seconds than five. ANNOUNCER: First and 10.\NRiggins, flea flicker back to Theismann. Theismann's in a lot of trouble. [TAPE REWlNDlNG] LElGH ANNE: One Mississippi.\NJoe Theismann, the Redskins' quarterback... ...takes the snap and hands off\Nto his running back. ANNOUNCER:\NFirst and 1 0. Riggins-- LElGH ANNE:\NTwo Mississippi. It's a trick play, a flea flicker... ...and the running back tosses the ball\Nback to the quarterback. ANNOUNCER:\NFlea flicker back to Theismann. LElGH ANNE:\NThree Mississippi. Up to now, the play's been defined\Nby what the quarterback sees. lt's about to be defined\Nby what he doesn't. Four Mississippi. Lawrence Taylor is the best\Ndefensive player in the NFL... ...and has been from the time he\Nstepped onto the field as a rookie. ANNOUNCER:\NTheismann's in a lot of trouble. And it was Lawrence Taylor... ...who slammed Theismann to the ground\Nat the 42-yard line. The blitz was on.... LElGH ANNE: He will also change\Nthe game of football as we know it. ANNOUNCER: We'll look at it with\Nthe reverse angle one more time. And l suggest if your stomach is weak,\Nyou just don't watch. LElGH ANNE:\NLegendary quarterback Joe Theismann... ...never played another down of football. Now, y'all would guess that,\Nmore often than not... ...the highest paid player\Non an NFL team is a quarterback... ...and you'd be right. But what you probably don't know\Nis, more often than not... ...the second highest paid player is,\Nthanks to Lawrence Taylor, a left tackle. Because as every housewife knows, the\Nfirst check you write is for the mortgage... ...but the second is for the insurance. And the left tackle's job is to protect the\Nquarterback from what he can't see coming. To protect his blind side. The ideal left tackle is big,\Nbut a lot of people are big. He's wide in the butt\Nand massive in the thighs. He has long arms, giant hands\Nand feet as quick as a hiccup. This is a rare and expensive\Ncombination... ...the need for which can be traced to that\NMonday night game and Lawrence Taylor. For on that day, he not only\Naltered Joe Theismann's life... ...but mine as well. WOMAN:\NMr. Oher. Mr. Oher. Do you understand?\NDo you know why l'm here? To investigate? Yes. To investigate. I'm here to investigate\Nyour odd. . .predicament. Do you find it odd, your predicament? Michael? I don't know. -Can l--? Can l leave now?\N-No, you can't. [INDlSTlNCT CHATTER] MAN:\NWhere's Coach Cotton's office? Thanks, man. They said you were the coach. Bert Cotton. Tony Hamilton, but everybody\Njust calls me Big Tony. Hey, Big Mike, check it out. Not even locked. White people are crazy. [GRUNTS] TONY: I promised my ma, Boo,\Non her deathbed... . ..that l'd get my son, Steven, out of\Npublic school and into a church school. I appreciate that, Tony,\Nbut I'm not involved with admissions. I just figured maybe\NI can come talk to you.. . . ..seeing as though\Nyou might need some players. -What kind of sport does he play?\N-Anything with a ball. The boy's good too. Classes start in a week.\NIt'd have to be for next semester. I know what you're thinking, coach. But look here, l got money, all right? See, l'm a mechanic at Wilson's Auto,\Nthe other side of town. Well, look, what if somebody drops out\Nor moves? Could they get in then? "They"? You only mentioned one son. That's right, Steven.\NBut there's another boy. -Heh. Another boy?\N-Yeah. Big Mike. Sleeps on my couch\Nfrom time to time. It's a bad deal. You know,\Nhis mom's on that crack pipe. He ain't got nobody else. He just\Nwanted to come along for the ride. -They're here?\N-Yeah. Now, the little one, that's Steven... . ..and the big one.... Big Mike. STEVEN:\NSwish! Big Mike! Ha-ha. Come on. Mother of God. MAN: Steven Hamilton's paperwork\Nlooks acceptable to me... . ..and l believe he'll do fine.\NBut this other kid.... -Big Mike.\N-Michael Oher... . ..gives us no reason to believe that. . . . ..based on his records,\Nthat he would be successful here. Well, how bad could it be? We're not exactly sure how old he is,\Ndue to his lack of records. He has a measured lQ of 80,\Nwhich is sixth percentile. His grade-point average\Nbegins with zero, 0.6. Everyone passed him along. They gave him D's so they could\Nhand their problem off to the next school. He's a brave kid. For wanting to come here,\Nfor wanting a quality education. An education denied him by\Nthe poor quality of schools he's attended. Most kids with his background wouldn't\Ncome within 200 miles of this place. Coach Cotton, we understand your interest\Nin this young man's athletic abilities. He wouldn't be able to play sports\Nuntil he got his grades up. Forget sports. Look at the wall. "Christian." We either take that\Nseriously or we paint over it. You don't admit Michael Oher\Nbecause of sports. You admit him because\Nit's the right thing to do. [STUDENTS CHATTERlNG] Class, this is Mike Oher. . . . ..and he's new here so l expect\Nyou all to make him feel welcome. Mike, just take any empty seat. This is a quiz based on the information... . ..you learned last year\Nin your science curriculum. Don't worry, it's not gonna be graded. I just wanna see how much information\Nwe need to hit again. Just answer whatever you know. [BELL RINGS] [STUDENTS CHATTERlNG] [GlRL LAUGHlNG] Thank you. -Can l leave now?\N-Yeah. Take your book. WOMAN: l'm tired\Nof having someone always in our home. I'm tired of him eating all the food. TONY: Look, man, you gotta be Christian\Nabout this thing. WOMAN: Let somebody else\Nbe Christian about this thing. TONY: Dee, come on, l can't kick him out\Non the street like he's some dog. DEE: Let somebody else\Ntake the responsibility. TONY: What, you want me to go to\NBeale Street and drop him off? DEE: When do l have time\Njust to be with you? TONY: All right, all right. Whatever.\NYou win. l'll take care of it. [WHlSTLE BLOWS] WOMAN: l don't care if Patrick Ramsey\Napproved the chair. He's an NFL quarterback,\Nnot Martha fricking Stewart. Because there is a difference\Nbetween Bunny Williams and a La-Z-Boy. No, see, when MTV Cribs\Ncomes to his house... . ..he'll be showing off\Nhis home theater. All I'm gonna see\Nis a brown Barcalounger. No, listen to me, I'm the designer,\Nmy name is on it. Deliver what I ordered, all right?\NThank you. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] Yeah! LElGH ANNE: What'd l miss?\N-Collins just got a dig. It's girls' volleyball, Mom.\NYou didn't miss anything. CROWD:\NOh! -Come on, Collins, move your feet.\NSEAN: Good job, Collins. Go. We'll wait for you outside. Don't double condition in\Nthe shower, you have homework. I'm going to Cannon's to study. SJ! SJ, do not go in the girls' locker\Nroom again. Come here! SJ, come here! MAN: The big kid's been here\Nfor, what, a month? He's still not cutting it in my class. Why does Admissions do this?\NI mean, it's not fair to us or the boy. They're just setting him up to fail. I don't think he has any idea\Nof what I'm teaching. And how would you know if he did?\NHe won't even talk. He writes. His name. Barely. He threw this in the trash can. "I look and l see white everywhere: White walls, white floors,\Nand a lot of white people. The teachers do not know l have no idea\Nof anything they are talking about. I do not wanna listen to anyone,\Nespecially the teachers. They are giving homework and expecting\Nme to do the problems on my own. I have never done homework in my life. I go to the bathroom,\Nlook in the mirror and say: 'This is not Michael Oher."' He entitled it "White Walls." How's the spelling? [CHUCKLlNG] Hi. Smile at them.\NIt lets them know you're their friend. You're Big Mike, right? Well, l'm Sean. But everyone calls me SJ. It's for\NSean Junior. My father's name is Sean. Sean Tuohy? He was a basketball star\Nat Ole Miss, point guard. Now he owns like a million Taco Bells. [HONKING HORN] [SPEAKS IN SPANlSH] LElGH ANNE: Who is that, SJ?\NSJ: Big Mike. Get your feet off my dash. Thank you. Put on your seat belt. [STARTS ENGlNE] Big Mike? Mike, l got a call from someone\Nat the police department. You remember a story in the papers\Na while back about a man who. . . . ..fell off an overpass? No one knew who he was. They didn't know if he jumped or if. . . . Well, anyway, he-- He passed away. Mike, that man was your father. They've been looking for\Nsomebody to notify and they-- They found your name in our registry. I'm really sorry, son. Were you close to him? When's the last time you saw him? I don't know. -He knows it!\N-Who knows it and what does he know? The material. Michael Oher.\NI gave him this test verbally. -ls that even allowed?\N-A "C"? On how big a curve? He's been listening all along.\NIt's amazing what he's absorbed. And, trust me, he's listening to you too.\NNow, his reading level is low... . ..and he's got no idea\Nhow to learn in a classroom. . . . I'm not saying he's gonna pass,\Nbut Big Mike is not stupid. LElGH ANNE: Hey. Good job.\NSJ: Mama. Daddy. SEAN:\NGood job. Hey. . . -. . . I got a question for you.\NSJ: Yeah? There was a little girl about two rows\Nback. What was her name? -Oh, that was Kinsey.\N-Kinsey, yeah. I saw your little lndian feathers\Nget all ruffled up. Yeah! She is nice. SJ. Don't let this go to your head... . ..but l thought you were\Nvery convincing in the role of.... -lndian Number 3?\N-Yes. I tried out for the chief,\Nbut they gave it to Andy Sung. I can't be sure, but l think there's\Nsome multi-cultural-bias thing working. Or maybe they just thought\Nthat he'd make a better chief. Dad, he's, like, Chinese. Yeah, and you're lrish. If you weren't the chief,\Nhow did you get the headdress? Dad, I'm gonna need a few more\Nof those free quesadilla tickets. [CHUCKLES] And where does the acorn fall? Hey, don't laugh too hard.\NThe quesadillas saved our ass. Don't use the A-word. What is he wearing? It's freezing. -What's his name again?\N-Big Mike. Where is he going? Hey, Big Mike. Where you headed? Gym. Go ahead. Turn around. Big Mike! Stop the car. Big Mike. Hey. My name's Leigh Anne Tuohy.\NMy kids go to Wingate. You said you were going to the gym? School gym's closed. Why were you going to the gym? Big Mike, why were you\Ngoing to the gym? Because it's-- It's warm. Do you have anyplace to stay tonight? Don't you dare lie to me. I've seen that look many times.\NShe's about to get her way. Come on. SJ, make room. Get inside. Come on. -Where we going?\N-Home. I know, it's my favorite part.\NHe's so cute. How'd the dork do in the school play? Um.... Okay. Collins, do you know Big Mike\Nfrom school? I'd give you the guest bedroom,\Nbut it's full of sample boxes. And the sectional in the family room\Nslides apart when you sleep on it. Least that's what Sean says. Mr. Tuohy sleeps on the couch? Only when he's bad. All right. The powder room is right there and we\Nwill be upstairs if you need us. All right? Okay. Sleep tight, honey. LElGH ANNE:\NWas this a bad idea? What? Don't lie there and pretend like you're\Nnot thinking the same thing as me. Tell me what you're thinking so I'll know\Nwhat's supposed to be on my mind. How well do you know Big Mike? Case you hadn't noticed,\Nhe didn't have much to say. What's the big deal?\NIt's just for one night, right? It is just for one night,\Nright, Leigh Anne? You don't think he'll steal anything,\Ndo you? I guess we'll know in the morning. ANNOUNCER [ON TV]:\N--talking about Mississippi and Arkansas. The fight's gotten more interesting. Well, if you hear a scream,\Ncall the insurance adjuster. [CHUCKLES] Mike? Big Mike? Mike? Big Mike! You gonna make me\Nwalk the whole way? All right, then. Where are you going? I don't know. Well, are you spending Thanksgiving\Nwith your family? ANNOUNCER [ON TV]: Those 40, 50 guys\Nfrom State here can quiet them down. As you mentioned,\Nthe Mississippi State defensive-- -Come and get it, y'all.\N-Yeah, baby! SEAN:\NLet's eat! Come on! It's that Rebel turkey.

LElGH ANNE: Oh, y'all, l forgot\Nthe potato salad. How's Ole Miss doing? SEAN:\NThey're kicking butt. ANNOUNCER: One wide receiver left...\NSEAN: Good, huh? ...and one corner, number 30,\Nout in press coverage-- Sean, salad. SJ: lt's great, Mom.\NCOLLlNS: So good. Thanks, Mama. Yeah, Mama. Nice little surge,\Nbut not much running inside. SJ: Come on.\N-And the Rebels got third and long here. Birdsong and Mawhinney on the tackle.\NOle Miss, five of 1 0 on third downs.

Because tomorrow l think I'm gonna\Nhave to show you how it's done. [SNORTS] I got clothes. You have clothes. And an extra T-shirt in a plastic bag\Ndoes not a wardrobe make. I have clothes. Fine, let's go get them.\NJust tell me where l'm going. All right. Tell me everything I need to know about\Nyou. Who takes care of you? A mother? Do you have a mother?\NA grandmother maybe? Tell you what, Big Mike, we can do this\Nthe easy way or we can do this the hard way. You take your pick. Fine. Tell me just one thing I should know\Nabout you. Just-- Just one. I don't like to be called Big Mike. Okay. Tell you what, from now on,\Nto me, you're Michael. Okay? So, Michael... . ..where are we headed? ALTON: I kid y'all not, y'all. I'm gonna\Ntell it.

WOMAN 1 : That girl will not listen to me.\NWOMAN 2: She don't listen to nobody. -Hey, Mike.\N-Hi, Big Mike. MlCHAEL:\NShe wasn't home. Well, we can come back. She probably moved to a nicer place. [MEN CHATTERlNG lNDISTINCTLY] I've been in Memphis my whole life\Nand never been anywhere near here. -You're gonna take care of me, right?\NMlCHAEL: I got your back. Now just follow me, y'all. Uh-huh. There we go. Oh, we also got apparel for the ladies. But everything we got that'll fit him\Nis right here. This is it? If this is all you got, why's it say\N"Big and Tall" on the sign? Big and Tall. You need\NBigger and Taller. -Holler if you need me.\NLElGH ANNE: Thank you. -See anything you like?\N-Hey, l got just what you're looking for. One thing I know about shopping\Nis that... . ..if you don't love it in the store,\Nyou won't wear it. The store's where you like it the best. So before you choose something,\Nthink of yourself wearing it. Say to yourself, "ls this me?" What about this one? Well, this is not atrocious, this. . . . No? All right, well, you go look\Nover there and I'll go look over here. Why would you need this many coats\Nout of plastic? Good Lord. What is this made out of? That's the one? That's the one you like? Well, all right, then. [CAR DOOR CLOSES] Have a great day! Learn something. [HORN HONKS] Oh, don't get your panties in a wad. [STARTS ENGlNE] [INDlSTlNCT CHATTER] BETH:\NThe best part about Paris was the food. They use sauce like we use gravy. -l had to join a gym the day I got back.\NWOMAN: Oh. Have y'all spent much time\Non the other side of town? -Where exactly are you talking about?\N-Alabama Street, Hurt Village. Hurt Village? That sounds like a threat. LElGH ANNE:\NNot far off. I think it might hurt me to go there. It would hurt your reputation\Nto go there. Actually, I'm from there but didn't mind\Nhard work, and look where I am now. Eating an $1 8 salad? [WOMEN CHUCKLlNG] And it's a little soggy, to be honest. What is this sudden interest in the projects?\NAnother one of your "charities"? Wait. Project for the projects.\NOoh. That's catchy! Y'all, money would raise itself. Okay. Count me in, Leigh Anne. [WOMEN CHUCKLlNG] -Break out your checkbooks.\NWOMAN: Yes. SJ, you have two more minutes\Non that Playbox thing, all right? SJ: Aw, Mom!\N-There you go. Michael, do you wanna stay here? I mean, because if you wanna stay here\Nfor a while longer... . .. l can find some time to\Nfigure out a bedroom for you. I mean, because look at this. You have practically ruined\Na $1 0,000 couch. Do you wanna stay here, Michael? I don't wanna go anyplace else. Well, all right, then. SJ, you better be off that Playbox. SJ:\NThat wasn't two minutes. Good night, Mrs. Tuohy. I see on the admission that we're\NMichael's contact for medical emergencies. MRS. SMITH:\NSean wrote that in last week. We needed a contact number and\Nthe ones listed weren't in service. I love that man. What's this? The state makes schools measure\Nfor career aptitude in the eighth grade. . . -. . .and this just came with his file.\N-What's it say about Michael? Spatial relations, third percentile. Ability to learn, fifth percentile. It's funny though. He tested in\Nthe 98th percentile in one category. -Which one?\N-Protective instincts. So over here you have a desk,\Nchest of drawers... . ..you have a nightstand, a light,\Nan alarm. Sean says all pro athletes use futons\Nif they can't find a bed big enough. . . . ..so l got you one of those.\NOf course the frame was heinous. I was not about to let that in my house,\Nbut I got you something nicer. -lt's mine?\N-Yes, sir. -What?\N-Never had one before. What, a room to yourself? A bed. Well, you have one now. MRS. BOSWELL:\NOkay. Define osmosis. I think I know that one. It's when water passes through\Na barrier. That's basically right, Michael.\NVery good. Name the combatants\Nin the Battle of Waterloo. I know that one. Um.... -The little guy, Napoleon.\N-Uh-huh. He was on one side\Nand a duke was on the other. Duke of Wellington. Yeah, and the Duke of Wellington,\Nhe had Russians helping him. Prussians. Enough with the rugby shirts.\NYou look like a giant bumblebee. SJ:\NThat Taco Bell. KFC catty-corner. And\Nthe Long John Silver's on the next block. MlCHAEL:\NYou own all of them? -Yeah. We've got like hundreds.\N-Eighty-five. Is that why Mr. Tuohy\Ndon't have to go to work? Whoa, whoa! Hey! l'm working even\Nwhen l'm not working. -What?\N-And you eat at all these places for free? All you want. lt's awesome. What do y'all do with all\Nthe leftover food from the restaurant? We have to throw some out,\Nwhat's already cooked. -That's too bad.\N-Yeah, I'd rather sell it. Seems like you could give it away\Nor something. -You should check into that, Daddy.\NSEAN: All right, l will, SJ. How come we're not eating\Nat one of your restaurants tonight? -Well, because tonight is a special occasion.\NSJ: What? I talked to Coach Cotton. He said\NMichael's grades have improved enough... . ..that he can go out\Nfor spring football in March. -lsn't that great?\N-Oh, man! You're gonna crush some people! [SEAN CHUCKLES] -Hey, guys, how we doing?\N-Great, thank you. I've got a design book l need to get.\NWhy don't you check our reservation? They'll seat us right away.\NCan't it wait?

[COLLINS CHUCKLlNG] [CHATTERlNG] You remember this one, Mom?\NYou read it to us like a thousand times. "He gnashed his terrible teeth\Nand he roared his terrible roar." I always liked this one. Mm.

LElGH ANNE:\NThank you for a lovely dinner, Papa. SEAN:\NHere we go. [INAUDIBLE DlALOGUE] Michael. Who was that boy\Nyou were talking to at the restaurant? Marcus. -Marcus, and he-- He works there?\N-Yeah. How do you know him? He's my brother. Well, we'd really-- We'd really\Nlike to meet him someday. Would that be okay with you? MlCHAEL:\NI don't know where he stays. LElGH ANNE:\NWhen was the last time you saw him? When I was little, maybe. LElGH ANNE: "Once upon a time in Spain,\Nthere was a little bull... . ..and his name was Ferdinand. All the other little bulls he lived with\Nwould run and jump... . ..and butt their heads together. But not Ferdinand. He liked to sit just quietly\Nand smell the flowers. He had a favorite spot out\Nin the pasture under a cork tree. LElGH ANNE:\Nlt was his favorite tree... ...and he would sit in its shade\Nall day and smell the flowers." -Good night.\N-Good night. -What?\N-What? Why are you smiling? I don't know, l'm just happy.\NReal happy. Does this happiness have anything\Nto do with Michael? No. It has everything to do with Michael. Mm. Mm. -Happy's good.\N-Mm. You know what l think we should do? We should start a charity\Nfor kids like Michael. -Okay.\N-Maybe fund a program at Wingate. Sure. Lord knows that school\Ncould use a little color. Poor Michael's like a fly in the milk\Nin that place. Are you listening to me? -Hmm?\N-l try to concentrate on one. . . . ..thing... . ..at a time. [WHlSPERlNG]\NYou knew I was a multitasker. .. . ..when you married me, right? -l sure did.\N-Right. Okay, just checking. Okay, Tuohy family.\NBig smiles, everyone. And one, two, three! Michael. Come on down here\Nand get in the next one. Come on. Come on. Come on down. Oh, come on. lt's not like I'm gonna\Nput it on the Christmas card. Okay, let's scootch in a little tighter. That's good. Really big smiles. Okay, one, two, three. -Say "Rebels!"\NALL: Rebels! ANNOUNCER [ON TV]: --a blitz off\Nthe corner, quick pass over the middle. -The hot route was there. And that's....\NLElGH ANNE: l got it. -Who's winning?\N-Tennessee. -Ugh. Who they playing?\N-Clemson. Your mama roots against Tennessee\Nno matter who they play? Uh-- Yes, l do. With gusto. She can't stand Tennessee. Collie-bell, l thought you were\Ngoing over to your boyfriend's. Thought l'd hang around here\Nfor the day. Hmm. I like that. There's a couple messages on the machine.\NI didn't check them. LElGH ANNE:\NAll right. BOBBY: Hey, Sean, hey, Leigh Anne, it's\Nyour cousin Bobby. Happy New Year's. -Listen, l've had about five cold ones.. .\N-Of course you have. ...so I'm just gonna go ahead and ask: Did y'all know there's a colored boy\Nin your Christmas card? [BOTH CHUCKLING] What? You just looked teeny-tiny next to him. Right? Like Jessica Lange and King Kong. [WOMEN LAUGHING] Hey, does Michael get\Nthe family discount at Taco Bell? Because if he does,\NSean's gonna lose a few stores. He's a good kid. Well, l say you make it official\Nand just adopt him. [WOMEN LAUGHING] He's gonna be 1 8 in a few months. Doesn't\Nreally make much sense to legally adopt. Leigh Anne. Is this some sort of white-guilt thing? ELAINE:\NWhat will your daddy say? Um.... Before or after\Nhe turns over in his grave? Daddy's been gone five years, Elaine. Make matters worse, you were\Nat the funeral. Remember? You wore Chanel\Nand that awful black hat. Look, here's the deal. I don't need y'all to approve\Nmy choices, all right? But l do ask that you respect them. You\Nhave no idea what this boy's been through. And if this is gonna become\Nsome running diatribe... . .. l can find an overpriced salad\Na lot closer to home. -Leigh Anne, l'm sorry. We didn't intend to--\N-No, we didn't, really. BETH:\NI think what you're doing is so great. To open up your home to him? Honey, you're changing that boy's life. No. He's changing mine. And that's awesome for you,\Nbut what about Collins? -What about Collins?\NELAINE: Aren't you worried? I mean, even just a little? He's a boy, a large, black boy,\Nsleeping under the same roof. Shame on you. I've got this. LElGH ANNE:\NBe honest with me, okay? Does Michael being here\Nmake you uncomfortable? They're stupid kids.\NWho cares what they say? -What kids?\N-At school. They're juvenile. And what do the juvenile kids say? It's really not worth repeating. And don't worry about SJ. He likes all the attention. He introduces\NMichael as his big brother. And what about you? It's fine. I mean, you can't just throw him\Nout on the street. I could make other arrangements. GIRL: Hi, Mike.\N-Hi. Need a push? Yes. MlCHAEL: Oh.\NGIRL: Higher, Mike, higher!

Papa. [SIGHS] How's he doing? Hasn't quite gotten the hang of it yet. [PLAYERS YELLING] [WHlSTLE BLOWlNG] COTTON:\NMike, son. Shuck the blocker, don't tote him! QB:\NSet, go! No, no, no! No, no, no! QB:\NSet, go! Balloons! They're balloons! Guys, quit looking at the balloons.\NEverybody! COTTON: Most kids from bad situations\Ncan't wait to be violent... . ..and that comes out on the field. But this kid, he acts like\Nhe doesn't wanna hit anyone. He's Ferdinand the Bull. COTTON: What?\N-Nothing. I thought he was gonna be a player. l can't\Nbelieve I used up all my chips to get him in. I thought you said\Nit was your Christian duty. Look, Bert, he's never even played before. Yeah, and he won't this fall if he\Ndoesn't improve a lot before then. Who died and made him Bear Bryant? [LAUGHS] Unbelievable. Oh, God bless me. This is your summer workout sheet. Now, first it says to warm up\Nand get loose. Well, go ahead, get loose. Are you loose? Okay. Next, it's five 1 00-yard runs\Nto stretch out your legs. -Can we just go home and play video games?\N-Look! Everybody at Wingate is expecting you\Nto be a star football player. Don't wanna let them down,\Ndo you? -l don't know.\N-What about Dad and Mom? Because, you see, in our family,\Neveryone's an athlete. Dad was a basketball star.\NCollins plays volleyball and runs track. And me, well, as you know, I do it all. And Mom-- Well, Mom was a cheerleader... . ..which doesn't exactly count,\Nbut don't tell her I said that. Okay? -Okay.\N-Okay. [BLOWS WHlSTLE] -Yeah. Fifty.\NMlCHAEL: Uhn. SJ:\NFifty-one. Fifty-two. Fifty-three. Come on, you can get him.\NGo, go, go! Come on! Five seconds left in the game! This way! High knees, high knees, high knees!\NSpeed kills, baby! Run like the wind!

SJ: You gotta get the tackle,\Ncome on, come on, come on! Come on, Michael. [GRUNTlNG] Mrs. Tuohy? I hear "Mrs. Tuohy," l look over\Nmy shoulder for my mother-in-law. Call me Leigh Anne or Mama\Nor almost anything else. -Can you help me get something?\N-What? Driver's license. Why do you need a driver's license\Nwhen you don't even have a car? Michael, why do you want\Na driver's license? It's something to carry\Nwith my name on it. [COMPUTER BEEPS] There's no one by the name of\NMichael Oher in the system. Another last name, perhaps? Look, l will sign something\Nthat says he lives with us. We'll pay for all of the insurance.\NWhatever it takes. Okay? What's it gonna take? SEAN: You wanna do what?\N-You heard me. -Shouldn't we at least talk about this?\N-What do you think we're doing? And don't act like\NI'm going behind your back. I know you put us down as\NMichael's medical contact at school. There is a huge difference\Nbetween paying for a broken arm. . . . ..and being legally responsible for\Nsomeone. l mean, a kid we barely know. That's another thing. We need to\Nfind out more about his past. He won't talk about it. He's like an onion.\NYou have to peel him back a layer at a time. Not if you use a knife. What if we took him to a child\Npsychologist or something? -Do you really expect Big Mike to--?\N-Michael. Do you expect Michael\Nto lie on a couch... . ..and talk about his childhood\Nlike he's Woody Allen? I mean, Michael's gift\Nis his ability to forget. He's mad at no one and he really\Ndoesn't care what happened in the past. You're right. Excuse me? "You're right"? How'd those words taste\Ncoming out of your mouth? Like vinegar. Well, at least promise me\Nyou'll think about it. All right. "All right, you'll think about it,"\Nor, "All right, we should do it"? Is there a difference? Just tell Gerald to hold on to the chiffonier\Nand l will be by there after a while. You know-- I gotta call you back. Bye. Excuse me. I'm not cutting, l'm just asking. Let me tell you something. We have been\Nsitting around here for over an hour. . . . ..and when l look around and all I see are\Npeople shooting the bull and drinking coffee. Who runs this place? I'd have it in shape in two days,\NI can tell you that. -l bet you would. How can l help you?\N-Oh, he was first. -No, you go ahead. l think l wanna hear this.\N-Me too. I do not appreciate the attitude. Ma'am, now, you can tell me\Nwhat you want. . . . ..or l can make sure\Nyou wait here all day. Now, how can l help you? I would like to become a legal guardian. Lord help that child. There's very little on Michael.\NMost of his files have been lost. -Well, what is in there?\N-A few case notes. This one describes an incident where\Nofficers forcibly removed Michael... . ..from Denise Oher's care\Nwhen Michael was 7. Quite a scene evidently.\NThey had to split up the kids. -And it's far from the worst.\N-Where is she? His mother? I don't know. lf you find her, we got\Na heap more files we could add to. Well, how many kids does she have? Least a dozen, probably. lf not more. With her drug-arrest record, my guess\Nwould be, she can't even remember. Can l see that? So we would need her permission,\Nright? No. Michael is a ward of the state.\NJust apply and get a judge to sign off on it. So you would just give him away\Nwithout even telling his mother? MAN 1 :\NCheck out this piece right here. MAN 2: Yeah.\NMAN 1 : Damn, girl. LElGH ANNE:\NMiss Oher? Hi. Miss-- Miss Oher? -You from the state?\N-No. My name is Leigh Anne Tuohy,\Nand your son... . ..Michael, lives with me... . ..and my family. How is my boy? How's Big Mike? He's fine. He's doing real well. We might have some wine in the kitchen,\Nif you.... Oh, no, no. That's real kind. When did you last see Michael? I don't know. How many--? How many foster kids\Nyou got living with you? Oh, l'm not a foster parent to Michael.\NWe're just helping him out. State don't pay you nothing? No, no. And you feed him and\Nyou buy him clothes too? Well, when we can find them\Nin his size. You are a fine Christian lady. Well, l try to be. This all real nice, what you're doing. . . . ..but don't be surprised if one day\Nyou wake up and he gone. What do you mean? He's a runner. That's what the state\Ncalled him after they took him from me. Every foster home they sent him to... . ..he'd slip out the window at night\Nand come looking for me. No matter where l was, that boy\Nwould come find me, take care of me. I've had some health problems. Miss Oher, was Michael born\Nunder a different name? Proctor. That was his daddy's last name. Where is he? -l ain't seen him since he left.\N-And when was that? Week after Mike was born. Do you happen to have\Nhis birth certificate? It's all right. l'll figure it out. [CLEARS THROAT] Mrs. Oher, you'll always be\NMichael's mama. Would you like to see him? [VOICE BREAKlNG]\NNo. Not this way. It's Williams. His last name's Williams. Couldn't even remember\Nwho the boy's father is. I checked out the new Madden. The colors\Nare better, graphics brighter. lt's awesome. Michael, we have something\Nwe'd like to ask you. -What?\N-Well, Leigh Anne and l, we-- Well, we'd like to become\Nyour legal guardians. What's that mean? What it means is,\Nis that we wanna know. . . . ..if you would like to\Nbecome part of this family. Kind of thought I already was. [LAUGHS] [FAMlLY LAUGHING] Well, all right, then. Right here. LElGH ANNE: You got a couple steps.\NSEAN: Better watch that big foot. LElGH ANNE:\NOne more. One more. There you go. All right. Take off the blindfold. SEAN: Well? That's the one you wanted,\Nisn't it? Heh. Here. Here you go, go ahead.\NTake it for a ride. Go on. SJ: Can l go too?\N-Yeah, but, Michael? Be careful. Shotgun! Whoo-hoo! -He wanted a truck?\N-Well, Michael thinks he's a redneck. SJ:\NCome on, Michael! Okay. See, you're the ketchup,\Nhere at left tackle on the weak side. The first play is simple. Gap. Now, see, this just means that you're\Ngoing to block whoever's in front of you. . . . ..or on your inside shoulder, if\Nyou're not covered by a defender. Now, l'll be the running back, and you\Nshow me what you're supposed to do. Ready? Hike! You'll block him. He'll hit him.\NQuarterback'll hand it off. He gets the ball, and he takes off! Open lane to the end zone.\NAll there is to it. What's going on here? Blended spice just scored. We were going through the playbook.\NMichael got moved to offense. When you're done, put the players\Nback in the spice cabinet. Thank you. SJ:\NNo problem. Actually, Mom, we were\Nkind of waiting for you. You see,\Nthe new Madden game came out. . . . ..and me and Michael\Nwere wanting to go get it. -l can't, l've got a meeting in 1 0 minutes.\N-But he can drive. He can drive us. [YOUNG MC'S "BUST A MOVE"\NPLAYlNG OVER CAR STEREO] SJ:\NOh, yeah, that's what l'm talking about. MlCHAEL: What you know about this?\NSJ: l know a lot about this. -Show me something then.\N-l'll show you something. -l'll start it. Follow my lead.\N-All right. -You ready?\N-Yeah.

LElGH ANNE: Where are they?!\NMlCHAEL: I'm so sorry! -Michael, are you okay?\N-l'm fine! SJ! Go help SJ! I'm so sorry. So sorry. MAN 1 :\NHow are his vitals? MAN 2: Excuse me, ma'am.\N-That's my son. SJ. SJ, baby. -Mama?\N-Yes, baby? Do you think the blood'll\Ncome out of my shirt? Yes, l think the blood\Nwill come out of your shirt. MAN:\NAn air bag deploys at 200 miles an hour. Your son is too small\Nto be in the front seat. But he is okay, right? Busted lip, bruised face. Usually when\Nsomeone his size gets hit with a air bag... . ..it's a fractured face, broken neck,\Nmaybe worse. It's like the air bag was coming for him\Nand changed direction. It's probably defective or something... . ..but your son's very, very lucky. No, I did. l called the insurance,\Nit's fine. lt's fine. I'll talk to you later. I gotta go. Bye. [SIGHS] SJ's fine. He is. He's actually enjoying all\Nthe attention he's getting back there. Hey, Michael, could've happened to\Nanyone, all right? lt's not your fault. Honey, look at me.

Baby, watch my stuff, all right? SJ:\NOkay. Well, at least he'll look good\Ncoming off the bus. They'll be terrified till they realize\Nhe's a marshmallow. Looks like Tarzan, plays like Jane.

Remember when we first met\Nand we went to that horrible part of town. . . . ..to buy you those dreadful clothes? I was a little scared. You told me\Nnot to worry, you had my back. -You remember that?\N-Yes, ma'am. And if anyone tried to get to me,\Nyou would've stopped them, right? And when you and SJ were in that car\Nwreck, what did you do to the air bag? -Stopped it.\N-You stopped it. You stopped it. This team is your family, Michael. You have\Nto protect them from those guys, okay? Listen. Okay. Tony here is your quarterback,\Nall right? You protect his blind side.

He was a little raw\Nwhen we first got him. . . . ..but we've, you know,\Ncoached him up a little bit. Where is that? Well, make me guess. Hello, Mama. Did you know to be eligible\Nfor a Division l scholarship. . . -. . .Michael will need to make a 2.5 GPA?\N-Really? His ACT is low and l don't see it getting\Nany better if he retakes it. Right there. Well, what's his GPA now? 1 .76. That's not bad when you\Nconsider where he started. Well, he's gonna have to\Nmake all A's this year. I'm serious.\NAnd that might not even be enough. So he goes to a junior college. Unh-uhn. Most inner-city kids that\Ngo to JC drop out in the first year. And his shot at the pros\Nwould go out the window. Pros?

There's 20 more of them on there.\NAnd these things right here, 50 of them. -Any of those from Ole Miss?\N-No. They're not gonna start recruiting\Ntill they hire another coach. Doesn't make any difference\Nunless Michael makes his grades. Ahem. What are we gonna do? I understand you applied\Nfor a teaching position at Wingate. I wasn't religious enough for them. I'm a spiritual person, Mrs. Tuohy,\Nbut I have certain, shall we say, doubts. Well, l appreciate your honesty,\NMiss Sue. What's the situation with Michael? -He needs to do better in school.\N-Obviously. But why the big push? Well, he's in line for a football\Nscholarship if he gets his grades up. -ls he considering Ole Miss?\N-Better be. I'd love to work with him. Well, when would you like to start? Mrs. Tuohy, um, there's something\Nyou should know about me. I don't usually tell many people... . ..but it's something l feel you should\Nbe aware of before you hire me. Uh-- What is it? I'm a Democrat. Okay. -l don't understand it.\N-Yet. You don't understand it yet. How big is your head, Michael? Big. And what's in there? -A brain.\N-A brain. It's full of knowledge. Like a file cabinet with maps,\Nand shortcuts for figuring things out. You'll get there, Michael Oher, because\NI'm here to help you use those maps. . . . ..and reach your destination,\Nlike Sacagawea led Lewis and Clark. Sacagawea? We'll get to that.\NAnd the history books have it wrong. All you need to know\Nis l'll get you there. Do you believe me? You trust me, Michael? Yes, Miss Sue. Try it again. What's the next one?

I find him extremely handsome. Yeah, l'm right here, Leigh Anne. Yeah, l know. NICK: So, Michael, we would love\Nto get you down to LSU for a visit. We've got a great thing going\Nright now.

I guess I was just wondering\Nhow much access I'd have to him. NICK: Well, SJ, you would have\Ntotal access to Michael. But better than that, in his first game\Nin Tiger Stadium. . . . ..we would like for you to lead\Nthe team out of the tunnel. -What do you think about that?\N-Sounds good.

I'm Tommy Tuberville,\NAuburn University. Leigh Anne Tuohy. Nice to meet you.\NMichael? -Houston Nutt, University of Arkansas.\N-Leigh Anne Tuohy. Nice to meet you. -Ole Miss cup, huh?\N-Michael? [SIGHS] Oh, come on. You know this. It's logical. I guarantee, you come to\NUniversity of South Carolina... . ..it'll be the smartest decision\Nyou've ever made. We want you, we need you,\Nbut the other thing is, Mike, you need us. Ow! Knoxville is a tremendous place\Nto live and-- HOUSTON: l know there's Lions,\Nthere's Tigers, there's Bears. Hey, there's only one Razorback\Nin the world. And not only that, you will look great\Nin Gamecock red. What's in it for me? SJ, l'm gonna get you a hog hat\Nand the whole family a hog hat. Are you telling me that's\Nthe best you can do? SJ, you remind me of me as a boy. Coach, help me help you. I can give you a Gamecock headdress,\Nand with real feathers. -What do you got for me, Phil?\N-l've been thinking a lot about that... . ..and one of the things\NI think would be special.. . . ..is we'll walk arm-in-arm to the center\Nof Neyland Stadium in the first ball game. . . . ..and do the coin toss together.\NHow's that sound? Coach Fulmer, it's a pleasure\Ndoing business with you. My pleasure, CJ. You bet you, buddy. [CROWD CHEERING] [DOORBELL RlNGS] Congratulations on getting hired. Thank you, ma'am.\NOle Miss is my dream job. You're coming a little late to the party\Nand we're diehard Rebels... . ..so l'm gonna pretty much\Ngive you a road map. -Got it.\N-LSU is out. Everybody knows Saban's\Ngoing to the NFL. Don't wanna name names,\Nbut on Michael's first two trips. .. -. . .somebody took him to a titty bar.\N-Terrible. Tell me about it.\NHe had nightmares for weeks. So when he visits,\NI want you to feed him ltalian. He likes fettuccine Alfredo.\NAnd take him to a movie. Not Chainsaw Massacre\Nbecause he'll just cover his eyes. Then get him in bed by 1 0. Got it? -Yes, ma'am.\N-All right. -What about Tennessee?\N-Mm. Breaks my heart,\Nbut they're still in the hunt. Ahem. Fulmer made SJ a sweet deal. -l hear that kid can really pepper the gumbo.\N-Hmm. He's his daddy's boy. You ready? -Let's do it.\N-All right. ED: Mike, do you love barbecue?\NI tell you what, Mike. You can go to a gas station and\Nget the best barbecue you ever got. It's a wonderful place to live. Fried catfish, all the good food that\Nwe love to eat and that's not good for us. . . . ..you can have it there, Mike,\NI promise you. And for you, SJ, this is what I can do. At Ole Miss, we have\NThe Grove by the stadium. We walk it before every game\Nin front of thousands of people. It's a sacred ritual. And l'm in front. Seen it a thousand times. Ever seen it from the front of the line?\NNext year, you and me, leading the team. Tennessee offered to let me\Nrun on the field and flip the coin. I'll throw in a sideline pass. Have you decided yet, Michael? No, Miss Sue. But you like Tennessee? Yeah. That's a good school. Not at the academic level of Ole Miss. . . . ..but they have a outstanding\NScience Department. You know what they're famous for? They work with the FBI . .. . ..to study the effects of soil\Non decomposing body parts. What's that mean? Well, when they find a body, the police\Nwanna know how long it's been dead. So the fine folks at Tennessee\Nhelp them out. Oh, they have lots of body parts. Arms and legs and hands.. . . ..from hospitals and medical schools. [CHUCKLES] And do you know where they store them? Right underneath the football field. So while it's fine and dandy\Nto have 1 00,000 fans cheering for you... . ..the bodies you should be worried about\Nare the ones right under the turf. Set to poke up through the ground\Nand grab you. Well, it's your decision\Nwhere you wanna play ball. Don't let me influence you. [APPLAUSE] All the other teachers are on board.\NI don't know what your problem is. I'm sorry. I will not give a student\Na grade he or she doesn't deserve. Well, Michael needs a B. What does he have to do\Nto deserve that? Right now Michael's doing\NC-minus, D-plus work. His best chance at improvement is\Nthe written essay at the end of the year. It counts for a third of the grade. Well, that's it. We're sunk. [GAME PLAYING ON TV] Why don't you write about\NGreat Expectations? You're a lot like Pip. I mean, he was poor. He was an orphan\Nand someone kind of found him. You should be able to relate to that. Fine. We'll go through the reading list. But you're gonna have to pick one,\NMichael. Pygmalion. A Tale of Two Cities. "The Charge of the Light Brigade." Half a league, half a league\NHalf a league onward I love that one. He loves it. Why don't you do this?\NAnd l'll watch basketball. SEAN:\NOkay. All in the valley of Death\NRode the six hundred. They named LSU's stadium Death Valley\Nbecause of this story. Alfred, Lord Tennyson\Nwas writing about LSU-Ole Miss. -You're kidding.\N-No. -lt's a great story.\N-lt's a poem! "Forward, the Light Brigade!" That's like the offense. "Charge for the guns," he said: It's the end zone. Into the valley of Death\NRode the six hundred. "Forward, the Light Brigade!"\NWas there a man dismay'd? Not tho' the soldier knew\NSomeone had blunder'd: Someone made a mistake? Yeah. Their leader. Their coach. But why would they go ahead\Nif they knew he messed up? Theirs not to make reply Theirs not to reason why Theirs but to do and die: Into the valley of Death\NRode the six hundred. They're all gonna die, aren't they? Yeah. That's really, really sad. I think you just found\Nsomething to write about, Michael. MlCHAEL:\NCourage is a hard thing to figure. You can have courage based\Non a dumb idea or a mistake... ...but you're not supposed to\Nquestion adults... ...or your coach or your teacher\Nbecause they make the rules. Maybe they know best,\Nbut maybe they don't. It all depends on who you are,\Nwhere you come from. Didn't at least one of the 600 guys\Nthink about giving up... ...and joining with the other side? I mean, valley of Death,\Nthat's pretty salty stuff. That's why courage is tricky. Should you always do\Nwhat others tell you to do? Sometimes you might not even know\Nwhy you're doing something. I mean, any fool can have courage. But honor, that's the real reason\Nyou either do something or you don't. It's who you are\Nand maybe who you want to be. If you die trying for\Nsomething important... ...then you have both honor and\Ncourage, and that's pretty good. I think that's what the writer was saying. That you should hope for courage\Nand try for honor. And maybe even pray that the people\Ntelling you what to do have some too. Kevin Lin. [APPLAUSE] -Good job.\N-Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me. Matthew Nichols. -2.52.\N-Hmm? Michael's final GPA.\NGot it off of Paul's computer. He did it, Sean. He did it. Wait a minute. You broke into\Nthe principal's computer? Hmm? Michael Oher. [APPLAUSE] [CHUCKLES] GIRL:\NMichael. Where in the world did you find\Na baby picture of Michael? Scanned it off an Internet ad\Nfor a toddler boutique. -Congratulations, Michael.\NMlCHAEL: Thank you. SJ:\NMichael, up top! [CHUCKLES] Way to go, bro. All right, that's enough. Young man, l think l need a proper hug. You're gonna be staying\Nin Deaton Hall. Where is it? It's 1 09. lt's right there. You'll be on the meal plan so you'll be\Neating over here in Johnson Commons. Johnson Commons, all-you-can-eat\Nself-serve ice cream. -Mm-hm.\N-As much as you want? [PHONE RlNGS] That's how Mama put on\Nher freshman 1 0. [CHUCKLES] -Stop it.\N-Whew. Hello. This is Mrs. Tuohy. They just wanna ask you a couple questions,\NMichael. You have nothing to hide. Mrs. Tuohy? Mr. Oher?\NMy name is Jocelyn Granger. I'm the Assistant Director of\NEnforcement for the NCAA. Please, call me Leigh Anne. So let's do this, shall we? If you wouldn't mind,\NI'd prefer to speak with Michael alone. LElGH ANNE:\NAnd how long is that gonna take? A while. It's all right. lt's okay. Go on. Michael. Michael. I'll be waiting for you\Nin the lobby, all right? LElGH ANNE:\Nl don't know, Sean. Just have a bad feeling about this one. This woman is tough, tough, tough,\Ntough, tough. Hold on. Hey. The client wants what? Were you aware that Coach Cotton\Nwas accepting a job at Ole Miss? No. And that this job offer came\Nafter you signed with them? Sean Tuohy, your legal guardian,\Nwent to Ole Miss. He played basketball. And Mrs. Tuohy went to Ole Miss\Nas well. She was a cheerleader. Is it safe to say that Ole Miss\Nis their favorite school? Do they like any other universities?\NWhat about, say, Tennessee? No, they can't stand Tennessee. And your tutor. -Miss Sue?\N-Miss Sue. Miss Sue is an Ole Miss grad too. Miss Sue ever try to persuade you\Nto attend Ole Miss? Did you know that the Tuohys\Nmake generous donations to Ole Miss? That even Miss Sue makes donations? That the Tuohys,\Nthey have a condo in Oxford.. . . ..so they can attend\Nas many athletic events as possible. That in fact, both Sean and Leigh Anne\NTuohy are by our definition boosters. Mr. Oher. Do you understand?\NDo you know why l'm here? To investigate? Yes. To investigate. I'm here to investigate\Nyour odd. . .predicament. Do you find it odd, your predicament? Michael. I don't know. -Can l--? Can l leave now?\N-No, you can't. What do you want, ma'am? -l want the facts. I need the truth.\N-l didn't lie. -l wanna know what you think about this.\N-Think about what?! The NCAA fears that\Nwith your recruitment. . . . ..a door might be opened.. . . ..that boosters from schools\Nin the South... . ..will become legal guardians\Nof young athletes without means. . . . ..and funnel them to their alma maters. I'm not saying l believe it.\NI'm not saying l don't. But there are many people involved in this\Ncase who would argue that the Tuohys. . . -. . .they took you in, they clothed you. ..\N-No. . ..they fed you, they paid for\Nyour private education. -They bought you a car, paid for a tutor. . .\N-No. No. . ..all as part of a plan to ensure that you\Nplay football for the University of Mississippi. Michael? We're not finished. The toile's not available,\Nlike l told you months ago. So why don't we go with the ticking?\NThe low nap. It's a beautiful-- I'll call you back. Bye.\NMichael. So, what happened? -Why'd you do it?\N-What? All along you wanted me\Nto go to Ole Miss. Well, of course I did. We love Ole Miss. -Why'd you do this for me?\N-What? Everything. Was it for you\Nor was it for me? Was it so I would go to school\Nwhere you wanted? Was it so I would do what you wanted? -Michael, no, l--\N-That's what she thinks. Is she right? Michael, honey, l need for you\Nto just listen to me. Don't you dare lie to me. I'm not stupid. Michael? Michael, of course\Nyou're not stupid, Michael. Mi-- I should've followed him. You had no way of knowing\Nhe'd disappear. Was he right? What he said about us? Leigh Anne, be reasonable. We gave clothes to a boy who had one\Npair of shorts and we gave him a bed. To hell with the NCAA.\NI would do it again tomorrow. What about all the rest of it? All the stuff we did to make sure\Nthat he got a scholarship. A scholarship to Ole Miss. He could go anywhere he wanted.\NHe knew that. Oh, did he? Did you ask him?\NBecause I sure as hell know l never did. Hey. Come here. Yeah. [SIGHS] Am l a good person? Not a joke. Not rhetorical. You are the best person that l know. Everything you do, you do for others. And why is that? I have not a clue. But you obviously get some sort of\Nsick satisfaction out of it. -Sean.\N-Yeah? What if he never comes back? [SIREN WAILlNG lN DlSTANCE] Oh. Heh. Whoo! Big Mike. Hey, get your ass\Non in here, man. -l'm looking for my mama.\N-Your mama? Yeah, l seen Dee Dee around. As a matter of fact. . .. Oh, yeah, she usually stop by\Nfor a taste around this time. Look, l tell you what,\Nwhy don't you just come on inside? I'm gonna get you a 40, we gonna chop\Nit up like real folk. Just until she get here. Come on, now.\NAin't nobody gonna bite you, baby. Hey. Hey, Big Mike, go on down there\Nin the living room, man.

Well, in that case, then, look here,\Nturn that up right there, little-bitty bitch! -Ha-ha-ha.\N-Bitty bitch! Hey, man. l'm just messing with D, man.

Sit down. l'm just trying to find\Nout a little bit about your fine white sister. Because I likes me some of\Nthat mommy-daughter action. Shut up. "Shut up"? Who in the hell is you telling to shut up? I will bust a cap in your fat ass.. . . ..and then drive east to pay a visit\Nto your cracker-ass mama... . ..and her sweet little daughter.

And it shoots just fine\Nall the other days too. [PHONE RlNGS] -Michael?\NMlCHAEL: Mama? MlCHAEL: You think the police\Nare gonna come and get me? LElGH ANNE: l imagine the last thing\Nthey want in Hurt Village. . . . ..is a bunch of cops snooping around. I swore l would never ask this, but\Nhow did you get out of there, Michael? When I was little and\Nsomething awful was happening. . . . ..my mama would tell me\Nto close my eyes. She was trying to keep me from\Nseeing her do drugs or other bad things. And when she was finished\Nor the bad things were over. . . . ..she'd say, "Now when l count to\Nthree, you open your eyes. The past is gone, the world is a good\Nplace, and it's all gonna be okay." You closed your eyes. You know, when l was driving\Nall over kingdom come looking for you. . . . .. l kept thinking about one thing. Ferdinand the Bull. I know l should've asked you this\Na long time ago, Michael. But do you even wanna play football? I mean, do you even like it? I'm pretty good at it. Yeah, you are. Sean and l have been talking and. . . . ..Michael, if you're gonna\Naccept a football scholarship. . . . ..we think it should be to Tennessee. And l promise that l will be\Nat every game, cheering for you. -Every game?\N-Every game. But l will not wear that gaudy orange.\NI will not. It is not in my color wheel\Nand l'm not gonna wear it. So you want me to go to Tennessee? I want you to do whatever you want. It is your decision, Michael.\NIt's your life. What if I wanted to flip burgers? It's your decision. lt's your life. Okay. Okay, what? MlCHAEL:\NI'm sorry I left the other day. You were pretty upset. -You asked a lot of questions.\N-l'm just trying to get to the bottom of this. But all the questions you asked. . . . ..were about why everybody else\Nwanted me to go to Ole Miss. Okay. Not once did you ask\Nwhy did l wanna go there. All right. Fine, Michael. Why do you\Nwanna go to Ole Miss? Because it's where my family\Ngoes to school. It's where they've always\Ngone to school. LElGH ANNE: College will be a different\Nexperience for you.

I need a proper hug. LElGH ANNE: I read a story the other day\Nabout a boy from the projects. No daddy, in and out of foster care. He'd been killed in a gang fight\Nat Hurt Village. In the last paragraph, they talked about\Nhis superb athletic skills... ...and how different\Nhis life might've been... ...if he hadn't fallen behind\Nand dropped out of school. He was 21 years old the day he died. It was his birthday. That could have been anyone. It could've been my son, Michael. But it wasn't. And l suppose I have God\Nto thank for that.
