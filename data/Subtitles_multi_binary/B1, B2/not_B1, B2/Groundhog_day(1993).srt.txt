Somebody asked me: "Phil, if you could be anywhere,\Nwhere would you be?" I said to him,\N"Probably right here... ...Elko, Nevada."\NOur nation's high at 79 today. In California, they'll have\Nwarm weather tomorrow... ...gang wars and some\Noverpriced real estate. In the Pacific Northwest,\Nthey'll have some... ...very, very tall trees. Clear across the Rockies\Nand Great Plains. But look out, here comes trouble. Oh, boy! Front coming our way!\NLook out! What will that mean to us?\NOne of these big, blue things! This cold, frigid arctic air,\Nthis big mass out of the north. It'll meet up with all this\Nmoisture out of the Gulf. They'll mix at high altitudes\Nand cause snow. Going out on a limb: Not gonna hit us here in Pittsburgh.\NGonna push off and hit Altoona. Close call! Let's look at the five-day. As you can see, nothing to be\Ntoo scared about. Bundle up warm, but you can\Nleave your galoshes at home. I won't be here for the 10:00.\NTomorrow's Groundhog Day. I'll be in Punxsutawney for our\Ncountry's oldest groundhog festival. According to the legend,\Ntomorrow, February 2nd... ...if the groundhog wakes\Nand sees his shadow... ...we've got six more weeks of winter.\NSo cross your fingers. Sounds like fun. You must really enjoy it.\NThis is your third year in a row. Four, Nan. Four. Thanks, Phil. Next, our entertainment editor\Nlooks at sex and violence in movies. Stay with us. We're clear. Have fun in Punxsutawney. For your information, Hairdo,\Na major network is interested in me. That would be the\NHome Shopping Network. Thanks, Larry.\NGo wait in the van. That was nice, Phil.\N"Big trees"! Stop, Kenny.\NLook, can you handle the 10 or not? Yeah, yeah. If you don't want to rush back,\NI can do the 5 tomorrow. Stay an extra second in Punxsutawney?\NPlease! Rita thinks it'd be\Na great idea... ...to stay for other events.\NYou'll get incredible footage. The people and the fun.\NThe excitement! You haven't worked with her yet.\NShe's really nice. I think she'll be\Na really good producer. You guys are going to have fun. She's fun. But not my kind of fun.\NI will be here for the 5. Rita. Can you keep a secret, Larry? I'm probably leaving PBH. So this will be the last time... ...we do the Groundhog together. What's wrong with\Nthe Groundhog Festival? In San Diego... ... I covered the swallows returning\Nto Capistrano for six years. Someone will see me interview\Na groundhog, think I have no future. I think it's a nice story. He comes out.\NHe looks around. He wrinkles up his nose. He sees his shadow or not.\NIt's nice! People like it! You are new, aren't you? People like blood sausage too. People are morons! Nice attitude. Look in the mirror and see how you\Nlook when you do that groundhog thing. For me? Once? He comes out, and there he\Nlooks at his little shadow. Want some blood sausage?\NI have some-- I like blood sausage. Rita, I can't stay here. Prima donna. -What's the matter?\N-I hate this place. I stayed here two years ago.\NI was miserable. -I won't stay here.\N-You're not staying here. -I'm not?\N-No. Larry's dropping me off. I booked you in\Na nice bed-and-breakfast. Great. I think this is one of the traits\Nof a good producer. Keep the talent happy. Anything I can do. Would you help me\Nwith my pelvic tilt? Within reason. Want to come\Nto dinner with Larry and me? No, thank you.\NI've seen Larry eat. You get your sleep.\NSee you in the morning. Don't be late. Did he actually call himself\N"the talent"? Campers, rise and shine!\NDon't forget your booties. -It's cold out there!\N-It's cold every day! -Is this Miami Beach?\N-Not hardly! Expect hazardous travel\Nlater today with... ...that blizzard thing. That blizzard thing.\NHere's the report. The National Weather Service\Nis calling for a big blizzard thing. There's another reason\Ntoday's especially exciting-- Especially cold. The big question\Non everybody's lips-- -Their chapped lips.\N-On their chapped lips. Will Phil come out\Nand see his shadow? -Punxsutawney Phil!\N-That's right, woodchuck chuckers! It's Groundhog Day! Get up and check that hog out there! -Morning!\N-Morning. -Off to see the groundhog?\N-I am. Think it'll be an early spring? I'm predicting March 21st. Good guess! I think that actually is\Nthe first day of spring. -Did you sleep well, Mr. Connors?\N-I slept alone, Mrs. Lancaster. Like some coffee? Is there any possibility of getting\Nan espresso or cappuccino? I really don't know.... How to spell espresso or cappuccino.\NThis looks fine. I hope you enjoy the festivities. -I'm sure I will.\N-There's talk of a blizzard. We may catch a break and\Nit will blow right by. The moisture coming\Nout of the south... ...by midday will\Npush on to the east. At high altitudes it'll crystallize\Nand give us what we call snow. Our high will get to\Nabout 30 today, teens tonight. Chance of precipitation, about\N20 percent today, 20 percent tomorrow. Did you want to talk about\Nthe weather or just chitchat? Chitchat. See you later. Will you be checking out today? Chance of departure today,\N100 percent. Phil? Hey, Phil? Phil? Phil Connors!\NI thought that was you! How you doing?\NThanks for watching. Don't tell me you don't remember me.\NI sure as heckfire remember you. Not a chance. Ned! Ryerson! Needlenose Ned.\NNed the Head. Come on, buddy.\NCase Western High! I did the whistling bellybutton\Ntrick at the talent show. Bing! Got the shingles real bad\Nsenior year. Almost didn't graduate. Bing again! I dated your sister a couple times\Ntill you told me not to anymore. Well? -Ned Ryerson?\N-Bing! Bing. Did you turn pro with\Nthat bellybutton thing? I sell insurance. -What a shock.\N-Do you have insurance? If you do, you could\Nalways use more. Am I right or am I right\Nor am I right? Ned, I would love to stand here\Nand talk with you. But I'm not going to. See you. That's all right!\NI'll walk with you. I see an opportunity,\NI charge it like a bull. Ned the Bull, that's me now. I got friends who live and die\Nby the actuarial tables. I say it's all one big\Ncrapshoot anyhoo. Ever heard of single-premium life?\NThat could be the ticket for you. Oh, God! It is so good to see you!\NWhat are you doing for dinner? Something else. It's been great seeing you,\NNeedlehead. Take care. Watch out for that first step.\NIt's a doozy! Phil! Phil, over here! Where have you been? It was horrible. A giant leech got me. You're missing all the fun.\NThese people are great! Some of them partied all night.\NThey sing till they get cold. Then they go sit by the fire\Nand get warm. Then they come back\Nand sing some more! Yeah. They're hicks, Rita. So, did you sleep okay without me? You tossed and turned, didn't you? You're incredible. Who told you? It's groundhog time. Okay. On me in three... ...two, one. Once a year, the eyes of the nation\Nturn to this tiny hamlet... ...to watch a master at work. The master? Punxsutawney Phil... ...the world's most famous weatherman.\NThe groundhog. Who, as legend has it,\Ncan predict an early spring. The question we have\Nto ask ourselves is: "Does Phil feel lucky?" Every year, the guy comes with\Na big stick and raps on the door. They pull the little rat out,\Ntalk to him. The rat talks back.\NThen they tell us what's gonna happen. Isn't he cute? Do you like the guys\Nwith the prominent upper teeth? No. This February 2nd, at 7:20\Nand 30 seconds... ...Punxsutawney Phil... ...the seer of seers... ...prognosticator of prognosticators... ...emerged reluctantly... ...but alertly... ...in Punxsutawney, PA... ...and stated in groundhog-ese: "I definitely see a shadow." Sorry, folks.\NSix more weeks of winter. On me in three, two, one. This is one time where\Ntelevision fails... ...to capture the excitement\Nof a large squirrel... ...predicting the weather. I'm grateful to have been here.\NFrom Punxsutawney... ...this is Phil Connors.\NSo long. Want to try it again\Nwithout the sarcasm? We got it. I'm out of here. Prima donnas. Oh, boy.\NTake a look at this. What is going on? I don't know. Perhaps that\Nblizzard we're not supposed to get. This is impossible. Hey, hey, hey. No, no, no. Nobody honks this horn but me,\Nokay, pal? No, no! Take it out of here. Commander, what's going on? Nothing.\NWe're closing the road. -Big blizzard moving in.\N-It's a couple of flakes. Don't you listen to the weather?\NWe got a major storm. I make the weather. All this moisture from the Gulf\Nwill push off to the east in Altoona. You got that moisture on your head. You can go back to Punxsutawney... ...or you can freeze to death.\NIt's your choice. So, what's it going to be? I'm thinking. Come on, all the long-distance\Nlines are down? What about the satellite? Is it snowing in space? Don't you keep a line open\Nfor emergencies or celebrities? I'm both.\NI'm a celebrity in an emergency. Can you patch me through\Non that line? Could I have one more of these\Nwith some booze in it? -Oh, I like it here.\N-Phil. Going to the groundhog dinner? No, I had groundhog for lunch. Wasn't bad.\NTastes like chicken. You two run along. Looking foxy tonight, man. Is your troop selling\Ncookies again this year? That's so funny. So, what are you doing? I think I'll go back to my room... ...take a hot shower\Nand maybe read Hustler. Suit yourself. Yo, mom. Isnâ€™t there any hot water? Oh, no, there wouldn't be today. Of course not. Silly me. Sweet dreams. Campers, rise and shine!\NDon't forget your booties. -It's cold out there!\N-It's cold every day! -Is this Miami Beach?\N-Not hardly! Nice going, boys.\NYou're playing yesterday's tape. --with that blizzard thing. That blizzard thing?\NHere's the report. The National Weather Service\Nis calling for a big blizzard thing.

Off to see the groundhog? -Yeah.\N-Think it'll be an early spring? Didn't we do this yesterday? I don't know what you mean. Don't mess with me, Pork Chop! -What day is this?\N-It's February 2nd. Groundhog Day. I'm sorry. I thought it was yesterday. Did you sleep well, Mr. Connors? Did I sleep well? Like some coffee? Yes, please.\NI think I'll have a double. I hope you enjoy the festivities. There's talk of a blizzard. Ever have dÃ©jÃ  vu,\NMrs. Lancaster? I don't think so,\Nbut I'll check with the kitchen. No, that's okay. Thank you. Will you be checking out today,\NMr. Connors? I'd say the chance\Nof departure is 80 percent. 75 to 80. Excuse me! Excuse me. Where's everybody going? To Gobbler's Knob. It's Groundhog Day. It's still just once a year, isn't it? Hey! Phil? Phil? Hey! Phil Connors!\NI thought that was you! My, oh my, Phil Connors! Don't say you don't remember me.\NI sure as heckfire remember you. -Well?\N-Ned Ryerson? Bing! First shot\Nright out of the box! So how's it going, old buddy? I'm not feeling well.\NWould you excuse me? It's funny you should mention\Nyour health. Guess what I do now. Do you sell insurance? Bing again!\NYou are sharp as a tack today! Do you have life insurance? If you do, you could\Nalways use more. Right! I mean, who couldn't? But you wanna know something? I gots a feeling... ...you ain't got any. Am I right or am I right\Nor am I right? I got to go. Watch out for that first step.\NIt's a doozy! Phil! Over here! -Where have you been?\N-Rita. Do me a favor. I need someone to give me a\Ngood, hard slap in the face. -How's that?\N-Good! If you need help with the other cheek,\NI'm right here. Something's going on. -Are you drunk or something?\N-Drunk's more fun. Can I be serious with you\Nfor a minute? I don't know, can you? Yes, I'm being serious! I'm having a problem.\NI may be having a problem. -Rita, Rita.\N-It's groundhog time. See? I knew you'd say that! I really feel... ...weird. Let's just do this.\NThen we'll talk. All right, on me in three... ...two, one. Well, it's Groundhog Day... ...again... ...and that must mean we're\Nup here at Gobbler's Knob... ...waiting for the world's most famous\Ngroundhog weatherman... ...Punxsutawney Phil... ...who's gonna tell us how much more\Nwinter to expect. This is a riot! Isnâ€™t he cute? This February 2nd, at 7:20\Nand 30 seconds... ...Punxsutawney Phil,\Nthe seer of seers... ...prognosticator of prognosticators... ...emerged reluctantly... ...but alertly in Punxsu-- Oh, my gosh! I know there's a blizzard. When will the long-distance\Nlines be repaired? What if there is no tomorrow?\NThere wasn't one today. Morning! Off to see the groundhog? Did you sleep well, Mr.-- Phil Connors! I thought-- Don't say you don't remember me.\NI sure as heckfire remember you! It's me, Ned! Ryerson! Needlenose Ned! Ned the Head! Phil! Over here! Can I talk to you?\NIt's not work-related. -You never talk about work.\N-We have to talk. -It's a creative meeting.\N-We've got work to do! I don't.\NI've already done it twice. When you get finished,\Nmeet me in the diner. -What's that all about?\N-I don't know. Prima donnas. More coffee? Just the check, please.\NThese sticky buns are heaven. Aren't they? Just put that anywhere, pal! Good save! Tell me why you're too sick to work.\NIt better be good. I'm reliving the same day\Nover and over. Groundhog Day. Today. Okay. I'm waiting for the punch line. Really! This is the third time! It's like yesterday never happened! I'm racking my brain trying to imagine\Nwhy you'd make this up. I'm not making it up.\NI'm asking for help! What do you want me to do? I don't know! You're a producer.\NCome up with something. You should get\Nyour head examined... ...if you expect me to believe\Na stupid story like that! Phil? Like the groundhog Phil? Yeah. Like the groundhog Phil. Look out for your shadow, pal! Morons, your bus is leaving! You guys ready? We better go,\Nto stay ahead of the weather. -Let's talk about it in Pittsburgh.\N-I'm not going back to Pittsburgh. -Why not?\N-Because of the blizzard! You said it was going\Nto hit Altoona. I know that's what I said. I think you need help. That's what I've been saying.\NI need help. No spots. No clots, no tumors. No lesions. No aneurysms. At least none that I can see. If you want a CAT scan or an MRI,\Nyou'll have to go into Pittsburgh. I can't go into Pittsburgh. -Why can't you go into Pittsburgh?\N-I told you, there's a blizzard. Right. The blizzard! You know what you may need,\NMr. Connors? A biopsy. A psychiatrist. That's an unusual problem... ...Mr. Connors. Most of my work is with couples,\Nfamilies. I have an alcoholic now. You went to college, right? It wasn't veterinary\Npsychology, was it? Didn't you take a course that\Ncovered this stuff? Sort of, I guess. Abnormal psychology. So... ...what do I do? We should meet again. How's tomorrow for you? Is that not good? I was in the Virgin Islands once. I met a girl. We ate lobster. Drank piÃ±a coladas. At sunset, we made love\Nlike sea otters. That was a pretty good day. Why couldn't I get that day... ...over... ...and over and over? Some guys would look\Nat this glass and say: "That glass is half empty." Other guys would say,\N"That glass is half full." I peg you as a "glass is half empty"\Nkind of guy. Right? What would you do if you were\Nstuck in one place... ...and every day was exactly the same,\Nand nothing you did mattered? That about sums it up for me. Good luck. I'll drop you off. This thing sticks a little bit. You got to jiggle it-- Come on up here, pal. Give me your keys, pal.\NGive me the keys. Friends don't let friends drive, right?\NStand up here. Take a deep breath. You feel okay? You're all right. You want to throw up here\Nor in the car? I think, both. I don't think I should drive. I don't either. Watch your head. Watch your knees.\NDon't break anything. Let's not forget seat belts. Who else could go for some\Nflapjacks right now? Let me ask you a question. Shoot. What if there were no tomorrow? No tomorrow? That means there'd be\Nno consequences... ...no hangovers. We could do whatever we wanted! That's true. We could do whatever we want. If we wanted to hit mailboxes,\Nwe could let Ralph drive! They want you to stop. Hang on! It's the same thing\Nyour whole life. "Clean up your room! Stand up\Nstraight! Pick up your feet! Take it like a man! Be nice to your sister! Don't mix beer and wine, ever! Don't drive on the railroad tracks!" That's one I agree with. I don't know, Gus. Sometimes I think you just have to... ...take the big chances. This is the police!\NPull over immediately! We're talking in here! I bet he swerves first. I'm not going to live by\Ntheir rules anymore! I noticed that. You make choices\Nand you live with them. My knee! Let me handle this. Three cheeseburgers,\Ntwo large fries... ...two chocolate shakes\Nand one large Coke. And some flapjacks! Too early for flapjacks? Yes! Rise and shine, campers! Don't forget your booties!\NIt's cold out there today! It's cold every day. What is this, Miami Beach?\NNot hardly! Slept like a baby. I'd love some of your coffee. -I hope--\N-Flurries moving in later... ...but the blizzard's going to hit\Noutside of town. Mrs. Lancaster? Was anybody looking for me\Nhere this morning? Perhaps a state official?\NMaybe a blue hat, gun, nightstick? No, no one like that!\NWill there be? Apparently not. Will you hold my room for me?\NI'm staying an extra day. Catch you tomorrow, pops. -Phil Connors!\N-Ned? I like to see a man of advancing years\Nthrow caution to the wind. It's inspiring, in a way. My years are not advancing\Nas fast as you think. More coffee? Keep it coming. Sure thing. Just put that anywhere, pal! Good save! Don't you worry about cholesterol,\Nlung cancer, love handles? I don't worry anymore. What makes you special?\NEverybody worries. That's exactly what makes me\Nso special. I don't even have to floss. What? The wretch, concentered all in self Living, shall forfeit fair renown And doubly dying, shall go down To the vile dust from whence he sprung Unwept, unhonored and unsung Sir Walter Scott. You don't like poetry? I love poetry! I just thought that was Willard Scott.\NI was confused. You think I act like this\Nbecause I'm egocentric? You are egocentric.\NIt's your defining characteristic. You guys ready? We better go,\Nto stay ahead of the weather. Thanks, Larry. Would you like a doggy bag? I'll stay and finish. I thought you hated this town. It's beginning to grow on me. Larry, quit staring.\NThese are excellent. You see the groundhog\Nthis morning? I never miss it. What's your name? Nancy Taylor. And you are? -What high school did you go to?\N-What? High school. Lincoln, in Pittsburgh.\NWho are you? Who was your 12th grade\NEnglish teacher? Are you kidding? In 12th grade,\Nyour English teacher was-- Mrs. Walsh. Nancy. Lincoln. Walsh. Thanks very much. Nancy? Nancy Taylor! Lincoln High School! I sat next to you in\NMrs. Walsh's English class! -I'm sorry.\N-Phil Connors! -That's amazing!\N-You don't remember me? I asked you to the prom. Phil Connors? I was short and I've sprouted. How are you? Great. You look terrific! You look very, very terrific! Listen, I got to go do this report. Are you a reporter? A weatherman with\NChannel 9, Pittsburgh. I should have known! That's great! But maybe later we could.... Yeah, whatever! Stay right here. Promise me?\NI'll be right back. Wish me luck! Good luck! Oh, Phil. Oh, Rita. Who's Rita? How should I know? What is this,\Nsome kind of one-night stand? On the contrary, Nancy... ... I love you.\NI've always loved you. This is going to seem sudden but... ...Nancy, will you be my wife? Rita. -Nancy.\N-Whatever. A gust of wind. A dog barks. Cue the truck. Exit Herman. Walk on to the bank. Exit Felix, and stand there with a\Nnot-so-bright look on your face. All right, Doris. Come on. Fix your bra, honey.\NThat's better. Felix! How you doing, Doris? Can I have a roll of quarters? Ten...nine...eight... ...car... ...six...five... ...quarters... ...three...two.... Felix? -Did I bring out two bags or one?\N-I don't know. I thought we were going\Nto a costume party. It's like I said, I love this film. I've seen it over 100 times. Phil!

That'll be one adult and-- -Two adults.\N-Two adults, I guess. --groundhog who, as legend has it,\Ncan predict an early spring. The question we have\Nto ask ourselves today is: "Does Phil feel lucky?" Rita, if you only\Nhad one day to live... ...what would you do? I don't know.\NWhat are you dying of? No, the whole world\Nis about to explode. What do you do? I want to know\Nwhere to put the camera. What are you looking for?\NA date for the weekend? No, I'm just interested in you. What do you want?\NWhat do you like? What do you think about? What kind of men\Nare you interested in? What do you do for fun? Are you trying to\Nmake me look like a fool? I'm trying to talk like normal people.\NIsnâ€™t this how they talk? -Close.\N-Okay, so talk to me. Let me buy you a cup of coffee. And a doughnut. All right. So what do you want out of life? I guess I want what everybody wants. Career, love, marriage, children. Are you seeing anyone? This is getting too personal.\NI'm not ready to share this with you. How about you?\NWhat do you want? What I really want\Nis someone like you. Oh, please! Why not? What are you looking for? Who's your perfect guy? First of all, he's too humble\Nto know he's perfect. That's me! He's intelligent,\Nsupportive, funny.... Intelligent, supportive, funny. Me, me, me. He's romantic and courageous. Me also. He's got a good body but doesn't\Nhave to look in the mirror often. I have a great body, and sometimes\NI go months without looking. He's kind, sensitive and gentle. He's not afraid to cry. This is a man\Nwe're talking about, right? He likes animals, children,\Nand he'll change poopy diapers. Does he have to use the word "poopy"? He plays an instrument,\Nand he loves his mother. I am really close on this one. Really, really close. It's Phil Connors! Hello. Thanks for watching. What are the chances\Nof getting out today? Van won't start.\NLarry's working on it. Wouldn't you know it? Can I buy you a drink?

Small-town people are\Nmore real, down-to-earth. -That's how I feel!\N-Really? -Some white chocolate?\N-Yuck, don't make me sick. No white chocolate. There is something\Nso familiar about this. Do you ever have dÃ©jÃ  vu? Didn't you just ask me that? People place too much\Nemphasis on their careers. I wish we could all live\Nin the mountains. That's where I see myself\Nin five years. How about you? I agree. I just like\Nto go with the flow. See where it leads me. Well, it's led you here. It's about a million miles\Nfrom where I started in college. You weren't in broadcasting\Nor journalism? Believe it or not, I studied\N19th-century French poetry. What a waste of time! I mean, for someone else\Nthat'd be a total waste. So bold of you to choose that. It's incredible.\NYou must be a very strong person. People place too much\Nemphasis on their careers. I wish we could all\Nlive in the mountains.

You weren't in broadcasting\Nor journalism or anything like that? Believe it or not, I studied\N19th-century French poetry. You speak French! I haven't done this since I was a kid. Me neither. It's fun! Clean fun. I hope one day I can do this\Nwith my own children. Where'd you get that? Well, I went over\Nto the snowman shop. Hey, an assassin! I'll protect you! I shall die for you.\NYou shall not take her! Find cover! I'm getting some good ones. That's a boy! Good try. Help me! What? I'm just amazed,\Nand I'm not easily amazed. About what? How you can start a day with one\Nkind of expectation... ...and end up\Nso completely different. Do you like the way\Nthis day is turning out? I like it very much. It's a perfect day.\NYou couldn't plan a day like this. Well, you can. It just takes an awful lot of work. Come in.\NI want to show you something. -I don't think I should.\N-I agree. That's why I'll show you one thing,\Nthen kick you right out. It's just lovely. Would you like to sit\Nand stare at the fake fire? It's a really wonderful room. It is now. I don't think we should do this. I don't either. On second thought,\NI think we should. It's the perfect end\Nto a perfect day. Well, it's a little fast for me. Me too. Maybe I should go. Where would you go? Why? We've got a perfect fire. I've got some French poetry here.\NBaudelaire.... I will read to you. I've got some ice cream on\Nthe windowsill. Hold on a minute. Rocky road. I love rocky road. Yeah, I thought so. You have to stay. No, really, I'm tired.\NWe can see each other tomorrow. No, tonight.\NIt's got to be tonight. No, Phil, really. Just stay for a while and\Nif you like it, stay longer. And if you like that, stay longer. Let's not spoil it, okay? I don't want to spoil it either. You know I can't stay with you. Why not? I love you. You love me? -You don't even know me.\N-I know you. Oh, no. I can't believe\NI fell for this! This whole day has been\None long setup. No, it hasn't. And I ate fudge. Yuck! No white chocolate, no fudge. What are you doing?\NAre you making some kind of list? Did you call my friends\Nand ask them what I like? -Is this what love is for you?\N-This is real. This is love. Stop saying that! You must be crazy. I could never love you because\Nyou'll never love anyone but yourself. I don't even like myself.\NGive me another chance. That's for making me\Ncare about you. I haven't done this\Nsince I was a kid. It's fun! And good, clean fun too.\NThat's what's missing in the world. I can't wait to do this\Nwith my own children. I want lots of kids! I want to adopt, I want my own kids,\NI want to have foster kids. I got this at Snowman City. Hey! Some kid just\Nthrew a snowball at us. Come here! Let's have some fun! I wish these were my own kids. Are any of you up for adoption? Here's a humdinger over here! Wasn't that great? Stop it! Phil! Over here! Where have you been?\NYou're missing the fun.

This is pitiful. A thousand people... ...freezing their butts off,\Nwaiting to worship a rat. What a hype. They used to pull the hog out,\Nand they used to eat it. You're hypocrites! All of you! You got a problem, Larry? Untie your tongue. Come here and talk.\NAm I upsetting you, princess? You want a prediction\Nabout the weather? You're asking the wrong Phil. I'll give you a winter prediction. It's going to be cold. It's going to be gray. And it's going to last you\Nfor the rest of your life. Once again the eyes of the nation\Nhave turned here... ...to this tiny village\Nin Western Pennsylvania. There is no way that this winter... ...is ever going to end... ...as long as this groundhog\Nkeeps seeing his shadow. I don't see any other way out. He's got to be stopped. And I have to stop him. Real good, Phil.\NReal good. He's out of his gourd. I'm worried. There's something\Nreally wrong with Phil. There's a lot of things\Nwrong with Phil. Hi, Phil. I've come to the end of me. There's no way out now. Just remember, we had\Na beautiful day together once. All right, little fellow. Good job. He just smiled at me!\NDid you see that? I believe he did. Okay, little fellow.\NThere you go. Hi, there. Something I can\Ndo you for? Hey! What are you doing? Get the word out.\NSomebody kidnapped Phil! We are going after him! Why would anybody\Nsteal a groundhog? I could think of reasons. Pervert. He must have just snapped! This ought to be good. What is he doing? What can he be thinking? Not bad for a quadruped. Check your mirrors. Side of your eye.\NSide of your eye. That's it. Hey, they're chasing us!\NCome on, make it fun. Don't drive angry. Don't drive angry. There's no way out\Nexcept the way we came in! We got him now! What is he doing? I don't know. If you got to shoot,\Ndon't hit the groundhog. Mustn't keep them waiting. It's showtime. On me in three... ...two... ...one. Phil! He might be okay. Well, no. Probably not now. Nuts. Did you sleep well, Mr. Connors? Would you like... ...some toast? Oh, my God! That's him. He was a really, really great guy. I really, really liked him... ...a lot. I'm sorry?\NWhat was that again? -I'm a god.\N-You're God? I'm a god. I'm not the God,\NI don't think. Because you survived a car wreck? You folks ready to order? I didn't just survive a wreck.\NI wasn't just blown up. I have been stabbed,\Nshot, poisoned... ...frozen, hung, electrocuted\Nand burned. Oh, really? Every morning I wake up without a\Nscratch, not a dent in the fender. I am an immortal. Special today is blueberry waffles. Why are you telling me this? Because I want you to believe in me. You are not a god. Take my word. It's 12 years\Nof Catholic school talking. I can come back if you're not ready. How do you know I'm not a god? Please. -How do you know?\N-It's not possible. I'll come back. Doris. This is Doris.\NHer brother-in-law owns this diner. She's worked here since she was 17.\NShe wants to see Paris... ...before she dies. Boy, would I! -What are you doing?\N-Debbie and her fiancÃ©. Do I know you? They're supposed to get married.\NShe's having second thoughts. What? Lovely ring. Bill's been a waiter three years,\Nsince he left Penn State to work. He likes the town,\Npaints toy soldiers and he's gay. I am. Gus hates it here,\Nwishes he'd stayed in the Navy. I could've retired\Non half pay after 20 years. Excuse me. Is this a trick? Maybe the real God uses tricks.\NMaybe he's not omnipotent... ...he just knows everything. -Who's that?\N-Tom. He worked in the coal mine\Ntill it closed. -And her?\N-Alice. Came from Ireland when she\Nwas a baby. Lived in Erie. He's right. -And her?\N-Nancy. Works in a shop, makes noises like\Na chipmunk when she gets excited. -It's true.\N-How do you know this? I told you, I know everything. In five seconds, a waiter\Nwill drop a tray. -Five, four, three, two, one.\N-This is nuts. -Okay?\N-Okay, that's enough. What about me?\NDo you know me too? I know all about you. You hope\Nfor more than Channel 9 Pittsburgh. Well, everyone knows that. You like boats but not the ocean. You go to a lake in the summer\Nwith your family. There's a dock and a boathouse\Nwith boards missing from the roof... ...and a place you used to\Ncrawl underneath to be alone. You're a sucker for\NFrench poetry and rhinestones. You're very generous. You're kind to strangers\Nand children. When you stand in the snow\Nyou look like an angel. How are you doing this? I told you. I wake up every day. Right here. Right in Punxsutawney.\NAnd it's always February 2nd. And there's nothing\NI can do about it. If you still can't believe me, listen: In 10 seconds... ...Larry is going to come\Nand take you away from me. But you can't let him. Please believe me.\NYou've got to believe me. You guys ready? We better go,\Nto stay ahead of the weather. What's that? "--to stay ahead of the weather." Maybe it really is happening.\NHow else could you know so much? There is no way.\NI'm not that smart. Maybe I should\Nspend the day with you... ...as an objective witness,\Njust to see what happens. This sounds like a science project. Concentrate. You got to want it. You got to want it, Rita. Come on. It's more\Nin the wrist than the fingers. Be the hat. Come on, go. -It'd take me a year to get good.\N-Six months. Four to five hours a day,\Nand you'd be an expert. -Is this what you do with eternity?\N-Now you know. That's not the worst part. What's the worst part? The worst part is that... ...tomorrow you'll have\Nforgotten all about this... ...and you'll treat me\Nlike a jerk again. I am a jerk. No, you're not. It doesn't make any difference.\NI've killed myself so many times... ... I don't even exist anymore. Sometimes I wish I had\Na thousand lifetimes. I don't know.\NMaybe it's not a curse. It just depends\Non how you look at it. Gosh, you're an upbeat lady! I want you to know it's been\Na really nice day for me. Me too. And maybe... ...if it's not too boring,\Nwe can do it again sometime. I hope so. You're still here. I thought you were supposed\Nto disappear. Or I was. Not until 6. You rat! I never said midnight. You knew I was waiting for midnight. Are you going to leave? No. Good. I'm sorry. It's all right.\NYou can fall asleep. I promise I won't touch you. Much. It's all right. I'm not tired. What were you saying? I think the last thing\Nthat you heard was: "Only God could make a tree." Really? What I wanted to say was... ... I think you are the kindest... ...sweetest, prettiest person... ... I've ever met in my life. I've never seen anyone... ...that's nicer to people\Nthan you are. And the first time I saw you... ...something happened to me. I never told you... ...but I knew I wanted\Nto hold you... ...as hard as I could. I don't deserve someone like you. But if I ever could... ... I swear I would love you... ...for the rest of my life. Did you say something? Good night, Rita. Good night, Phil. Campers, rise and shine!\NDon't forget your booties. -It's cold out there!\N-It's cold every day. -Is this Miami Beach?\N-Not hardly! Who wants coffee?\NGet it while it's hot. -Thanks, Phil.\N-Larry? Skim milk, two sugar. Thanks, Phil. Pastry? We're setting up. Pastry, Larry?\NTake your pick. Thanks. Raspberry. Great. I talked with Buster Green,\Nthe head groundhog honcho. He said if we set up here\Nwe'll get a better shot. -What do you think?\N-Sounds good. Larry? Yeah. Let's go for it. Good work, Phil. Maybe we'll get lucky.\NLet me give you a hand. No, no. You got your coffee.\NI'll get it. We never talk.\NDo you have kids? I'd like a piano lesson. I'm with a student. But if you\Nwant to come back tomorrow-- I kind of want to get started.\NI can give you $1000. Come on in. Morning!\NOff to see the groundhog? Think it'll be an early spring? Winter, slumbering in the open air Wears on his smiling face A dream of spring Ciao! Ciao! How does she look? Great. Thank you. -Did you know he could ice sculpt?\N-No. Not bad. You say\Nthis is your first lesson? Yes, but my father\Nwas a piano mover, so.... -Phil Connors, I thought it was you.\N-Ned Ryerson. I have missed you so much. I don't know where you're headed,\Nbut can you call in sick? I got to get going. It's good to see you, Phil. Hello, father. Let's get you someplace warm. Remember me? You brought the old man in? How is he? He just passed away. -What did he die of?\N-He was just old. It was just his time. -I want to see his chart. Excuse me.\N-Sir! You can't come in here. Sir, this is a restricted area. Where's the chart? Sometimes people just die. Not today. Gets hard down there at the bottom. Here you go. Thank you. Come on, dad. Come on, pop. Come on. Come on, breathe. Breathe, pop! Breathe, pop! When Chekhov saw the long winter... ...he saw a winter bleak\Nand dark and bereft of hope. Yet we know winter is just\Nanother step in the cycle of life. But standing here among\Nthe people of Punxsutawney... ...and basking in the warmth\Nof their hearths and hearts... ... I couldn't imagine a better fate... ...than a long and lustrous winter. From Punxsutawney, it's Phil Connors. So long. Nice speech. Very nice. Thank you. -How was that for you two?\N-My man, you touched me. -Thanks, Larry.\N-Thank you. I got to go. That was surprising.\NI didn't know you were so versatile. I surprise myself sometimes. Would you like a cup of coffee? I'd love to. Can I have a rain check?\NI've got some errands. Errands? What errands? I thought we were going back. What do you say?\NWhat do you say? You little brat.\NYou have never thanked me! I'll see you tomorrow... ...maybe. You totaled it. -It's only a flat tire.\N-What are we going to do? -It's an earthquake!\N-It's not an earthquake. What is it? Thank you, young man. It's nothing.\NI had the tire and the jack. Just be comfortable.\NIt'll be a minute. Who is that? He must be from the motor club. He's having a heart attack!\NDo something! Call 411, an ambulance, a lawyer,\Ndoctor, anything! I think that did it. If you're going to eat steak,\Nget sharper teeth. -Enjoy your meal.\N-Thank you. Who was that? -I'm fine, I'm fine.\N-Are you sure? Eat, eat! People don't understand... ...what's involved.\NThis is an art form. I think most people just think... ...that I hold a camera\Nand point it at stuff. There's a lot more to it than that. Would you be interested in seeing\Nthe inside of a van? You know, I really have to\Nget back to the party. Great idea.\NI'll go with you. Let me just drop a tip here. Hi! How are you? Rita, this is Nancy. We were going to the party.\NYou going? Sounds like fun.\NMaybe we should call Phil. I think he's already in there. Isnâ€™t he good? He's great! He's my student. I'm so proud. Thank you. Hello, welcome to our party. I didn't know you could\Nplay like that. I'm versatile. It's that nice young man\Nfrom the motor club. Thank you again. It's nothing, ladies. He's the fastest jack\Nin Jefferson County. What was that all about? Don't know. They've been\Nhitting on me all night. There you are! I never thanked you properly\Nfor what you did. He would've choked for sure. He may have. He was trying\Nto swallow a whole cow. I owe you one, buddy. Hang on to him, dear.\NHe's a real find. What did you do today? Same old, same old. Excuse me, Mr. Connors. Fred, how was the wedding? Thank you for making\NDebbie go through with it. All I did was fan her flame\Nof passion for you. You are the best. No, you are. Rita, this is\NDebbie and Fred Kleiser. -Here you go, kids. Congratulations.\N-What is this? No way! WrestleMania!\NNo way! How'd you know?\NWe'll be in Pittsburgh anyway! Thank you. You're a real pal. Oh, this is the best. I don't understand. I guess not. How does everyone know you?\NYou come once a year. You're the most popular\Nperson in town. Excuse me, Dr. Connors? I want to thank you\Nfor fixing Felix's back. He can help around the house again. Well, I'm sorry\Nto hear that, Felix. Dr. Connors? It's kind of an honorary title. What is going on?

Do I hear a buck and a half? Anybody? 75 cents? I bid two bits! Sold to the lady for 25 cents. I got him! Phil Connors,\NI thought that was you. This is Ned Ryerson,\Nmy new insurance agent. I'll say. I haven't seen him for 20 years. He comes up and buys whole life,\Nterm, fire, auto, dental, health... ...with the optional death\Nand dismemberment plan. This is the best day of my life. -Mine too.\N-Mine too. Where are we going? Let's not spoil it. Let's not--\NI got that. Why can't I look? Because you bother me a lot. I'm getting cold. How long do I have to sit here? I'm giving you your money's worth.\NYou paid top dollar for me. Well, I think you were a bargain. Sweet of you to say.\NYou're right. Is it finished yet? I still have to put\Ncherry syrup on the top... ...then we can eat it. Come on, Phil.\NI'm freezing! One second, one second. Let me turn it in the light. It's amazing. It's beautiful. How did you do that? I know your face so well,\NI could do it with my eyes closed. It's lovely. I don't know what to say. I do. No matter what happens tomorrow... ...or for the rest of my life... ... I'm happy now... ...because I love you. I think I'm happy too. Please. Not again. -That's a great song.\N-It's not. Don't listen to this man-- It's too early. Something is different. Good or bad? Anything different is good. But this could be real good. Why are you here? I bought you.\NI own you. But why are you still here? You said, "Stay,"\Nso I stayed. I said, "Stay,"\Nso you stayed.
