Hey! I'll be right with you. So, Cameron. Here you go. Nine schools in 1 0 years.\NMy, my. Army brat? -Yeah. My dad is...\N-That's enough. I'm sure you won't find Padua\Nany different than your old schools. Same little ass-wipe shit-for-brains\Neverywhere. Excuse me? Did you just say...\NAm I in the right office? Not anymore, you're not. I've got\Ndeviants to see and a novel to finish. Now, scoot. Scoot! Okay. Thanks. Thanks a lot. Patrick Verona. I see we're making\Nour visits a weekly ritual. Only so we can have these moments\Ntogether. Should I hit the lights? Oh, very clever, kangaroo boy. Says here you exposed yourself\Nin the cafeteria? I was joking with the lunch lady.\NIt was a bratwurst. Bratwurst? Aren't we the optimist? Next time, keep it in your pouch, okay? Scoot! Hello! Michael Eckman.\NI'm supposed to show you around. Oh, hi. Thank God. You know... Normally they send down\None of those audio visual geeks. No, I do. I know what you mean. Hey, Michael,\Nwhere should I put those slides? Michael? So... Cameron. Here's the breakdown. Over there,\Nwe've got your basic beautiful people. Now listen. Unless they talk\Nto you first, don't bother. -Wait. Is that your rule or theirs?\N-Watch. Hey, there. -Eat me.\N-You see that? To the left, we have the coffee kids. -That was Costa Rican, butthead!\N-Very edgy. Don't make any sudden movements\Naround them. These delusionals\Nare your white Rastas. They're big Marley fans.\NThey think they're black. -Semi-political, but mostly...\N-Smoke a lot of weed? -Yeah. These guys...\N-Wait, wait. Let me guess. Cowboys? Yeah, but the closest they've come\Nto a cow is McDonald's. McDonald's. These are your future Mvys.\NWe're all Ivy League accepted. Yuppie greed is back, my friend. -Hey, guys, how you doin'?\N-Close it, Bogey! -Yesterday, I was their god.\N-What happened? Bogey Lozenstein\Nstarted a rumor that I... That I buy my Izods at an outlet mall. -So they kicked you out?\N-Hostile takeover. But don't worry. -He'll pay. Now, over here...\N-Oh, my God. -What group is she in?\N-The "don't even think about it" group. That's Bianca Stratford.\NShe's a sophomore. I burn, I pine, I perish. Of course you do.\NYou know, she's beautiful and deep. I'm sure. Yeah, but see, there's a difference\Nbetween like and love. Because I like my Skechers,\Nbut I love my Prada backpack. But I love my Skechers. That's because you don't have\Na Prada backpack. Listen, forget her.\NIncredibly uptight father. And it's a widely known fact that the Stratford sisters\Naren't allowed to date. Yeah. Whatever. Okay, then. What did everyone\Nthink of the Sun Also Rises? I loved it. He's so romantic. Romantic? Hemingway? He was an abusive, alcoholic\Nmisogynist who squandered half his life hanging around Picasso\Ntrying to nail his leftovers. As opposed to a bitter,\Nself-righteous hag who has no friends? Pipe down, Chachi. I guess in this society,\Nbeing male and an asshole makes you worthy of our time. What about Sylvia Plath, or Charlotte Bronte\Nor Simone de Beauvoir? What'd I miss? The oppressive patriarchal values\Nthat dictate our education. Good. -Hey, hey!\N-Mr. Morgan. Is there any chance we could get Kat\Nto take her Midol before she comes to class? Someday you're gonna get\Nbitch-slapped, and I'm not gonna do a thing to stop it. And, Kat, I want to thank you\Nfor your point of view. I know how difficult it must be for you\Nto overcome all those years of upper-middle class\Nsuburban oppression. Must be tough. But the next time you storm the P.T.A.,\Ncrusading for better lunch meat, or whatever it is\Nyou white girls complain about, ask them why they can't buy a book\Nwritten by a black man! -That's right, mon!\N-Don't even get me started on you two. Anything else? Yeah, go to the office.\NYou're pissing me off. -What? Mr. Morgan...\N-Later! Undulating with desire, Adrienne removes her red... Crimson cape at the sight of Reginald's stiff and... Judith! What's another word for "engorged"? I'll look it up. Okay. -Swollen. Turgid.\N-Tumescent? Perfect. So, I hear you were terrorizing\NMr. Morgan's class again. Expressing my opinion\Nis not a terrorist action. The way you expressed your opinion\Nto Bobby Ridgezay? By the way, his testicle\Nretrieval operation went quite well, in case you're interested. I still maintain\Nthat he kicked himself in the balls. The point is, Kat... Cat. People perceive you as somewhat... Tempestuous? "Heinous bitch" is\Nthe term used most often. You might want to work on that. Thank you. As always, thank you\Nfor your excellent guidance. I'll let you get back\Nto Reginald's quivering member. "Quivering member." I like that. Virgin alert. Your favorite. Lookin' good, ladies. Oh, she's out of reach, even for you. -No one's out of reach for me.\N-You wanna put money on that? Money, I've got. This I'm gonna do for fun. -Who's that guy?\N-That's Joey Donner. He's a jerk off, and a model. -He's a model?\N-A model. Mostly regional stuff, but he's rumored\Nto have a big tube sock ad coming out. -Really?\N-Really. Man, look at her. Is she always so... -Vapid?\N-How can you say that? She's totally... -Conceited.\N-What are you talking about? There's more to her than you think. Look at the way she smiles,\Nand look at her eyes, man. She's totally pure.\NYou're missing what's there. No, no, Cameron, no. What's there is a snotty little princess wearing\Na strategically planned sun dress to make guys like us realize\Nthat we can never touch her and guys like Joey realize\Nthat they want to. She, my friend, is what we will spend\Nthe rest of our lives not having. Put her in your spank bank, move on. -Move on.\N-No, no. You're wrong about her. I mean, you know,\Nnot about the spanking part, but the rest, you're wrong. All right... I'm wrong?\NYou wanna take a shot, be my guest. She's actually looking\Nfor a French tutor. Are you serious? That's perfect! Do you speak French? Well, no, but I will. Hey. Your little Rambo look is out, Kat. -Didn't you read last month's Cosmo?\N-Run along. I know you can be overwhelmed,\Nand you can be under whelmed, but can you everjust be "whelmed"? -I think you can in Europe.\N-Hi, ladies. Would you szeet young things\Nlike a ride? Careful on the leather. That's a charming new development. It's disgusting. Remove head from sphincter,\Nthen drive! -You okay?\N-Yeah. Just a minor encounter with the shrew. -That's your girlfriend's sister.\N-That's Bianca's sister? The mewling, rampalian wretch herself. -Stay cool, bro.\N-Yeah, see you later. Look out! My balls! Oh, boy. Yeah! Hello, Katarina.\NMake anyone cry today? Sadly, no. But it's only 4:30. -Hi, Daddy.\N-Hello, precious. -And where have you been?\N-Nowhere. Hey, what's this?\NIt says Sarah Lawrence. I got in! Honey, that's great, but isn't Sarah Lawrence\Non the other side of the country? Thus the basis of its appeal. I thought we decided you were\Ngoing to stay here and go to school. "U-Dub," like me. Be a Husky. No, you decided. Oh, okay, so what, you just pick up\Nand leave, is that it? Let's hope so. Ask Bianca who drove her home. Kat, don't change the...\NDrove? Who drove you home? Now, don't get upset, Daddy,\Nbut there's this boy... -Who's a flaming imbecile.\N-And I think he might ask me... Please. I think I know\Nwhat he's going to ask you. And I think I know the answer. No.\NIt's always no. What are the two house rules? Number one,\Nno dating till you graduate. Number two,\Nno dating till you graduate. -That's it.\N-Daddy, that's so unfair. All right, you want to know\Nwhat's unfair? This is for you, too. This morning I delivered a set of twins\Nto a 1 5-year-old girl. Do you know what she said to me? I'm a crack whore who should have made my skeezy boyfriend\Nwear a condom? Close, but no. She said,\N"I should have listened to my father." -She did not.\N-Well, that's what she would have said if she wasn't so doped up. Can we focus on me\Nfor a second, please? I am the only girl in school\Nwho's not dating. Oh, no, you're not.\NYour sister doesn't date. And I don't intend to. And why is that again? Have you seen the unwashed\Nmiscreants that go to that school? Where did you come from?\NPlanet Loser? As opposed to\NPlanet Look At Me, Look At Me. Okay, here's how we solve this one. Old rule out. New rule, Bianca can date when she does. But she's a mutant!\NWhat if she never dates? Then you'll never date. Oh, I like that. And I'll get to sleep at night. The deep slumber of a father whose daughters aren't out\Nbeing impregnated. -We'll talk about Sarah Lawrence later.\N-Fine. -Wait! Daddy!\N-Gotta go. Can't you just find\Nsome blind, deaf retard to take you to the movies\Nso I can have one date? I'm sorry. Looks like\Nyou'll just have to miss out on the witty repartee\Nof Joey "Eat Me" Donner. You suck. Hi. Can we make this quick? Roxanne Corinne and Andrew Jarrett\Nare having an incredibly horrendous public break-up on the quad, again. Oh, yeah, okay. I thought that we'd start with pronunciation,\Nif that's all right with you. Not the hacking and gagging\Nand spitting part, please. Well, there is an alternative. -There is?\N-Yeah, French food. We could eat some together Saturday night? You're asking me out? That's so cute.\NWhat's your name again? Cameron. Listen, I know\Nthat your dad doesn't let you date, but I thought\Nthat if it was for French class... -Oh, wait a minute. Curtis...\N-Cameron. My dad just came up with a new rule.\NI can date when my sister does. You're kidding.\NLet me ask you, do you like sailing? 'Cause I read about this place\Nthat rents boats... A beaucoup problemo, Calvin. In case you haven't heard, my sister's\Na particularly hideous breed of loser. Yeah. Yeah, I noticed\Nshe's a little antisocial. -Why is that?\N-Unsolved mystery. She used to be really popular,\Nand then it was like she got sick of it or something. Theories abound as to why, but I'm pretty sure she's just\Nincapable of human interaction. Plus, she's a bitch. Well, yeah, but I'm sure,\Nyou know, that there are lots of guys who wouldn't mind\Ngoing out with a difficult woman. I mean, you know, people jump\Nout of airplanes and ski off cliffs. It'd be like "Extreme Dating." You think you could find\Nsomeone that extreme? Yeah, sure, why not? -And you'd do that for me?\N-Hell, yes! I mean, you know, I could look into it. Now, I have gathered a group of guys,\Ncouldn't be more perfect. Padua's finest. Hi. How you doin'? Would any of you be interested\Nin dating Katarina Stratford? I've never been that ripped. Maybe if we were\Nthe last two people alive, and there were no sheep. Are there sheep? Did I or did I not tell you\Nit was pointless? No one will go out with her. Hey, hey, what about him? Him? No, don't...\NDon't look at him, okay? He's a criminal.\NI heard he lit a state trooper on fire. -He just did a year in San Quentin.\N-Well, at least he's horny. I'm serious, man. He's whacked. He sold his own liver on the\Nblack market for a new set of speakers. He's our guy. Hi. How you doin'? Listen, I... Okay. Later, then. How do we get him to date Kat? I don't know. I mean, we could pay him, but we don't have any money. Yeah, well, what we need is a backer. -What's that?\N-Someone with money who's stupid. Oh, yeah. Is that a peach Fruit Roll-Up?\NBecause you don't see many... Oh, okay. Yeah. All right. -Are you lost?\N-No. Actually, I just came by to chat. -We don't chat.\N-Well, actually, I thought that I'd run an idea by you,\Njust to see if you're interested. -I'm not.\N-Well, hear me out. Now, you want Bianca, right? But she can't go out with you\Nbecause her sister is this insane head case, and no one\Nwill go out with her, right? Does this conversation\Nhave a purpose? What I think you need to do, is you need to hire a guy\Nwho'll go out with her. Someone who doesn't scare so easily. That guy? -I heard he ate a live duck once.\N-Everything but the beak and feet. Clearly, he's a solid investment. -What's in it for you?\N-Hey. I'm walking down the hall and\NI say hello to you, you say hello to me. Yeah, yeah, I get it.\NYou're cool by association. I'll think about it. -We're done now.\N-Yeah. What are you doing\Ngetting him involved? Relax, now. Relax. We let him pretend\Nhe's calling the shots. While he's busy setting things up,\Nyou have time with Bianca. That is a good idea. All right. I have a dick on my face, don't I? Now, remember, guys, grip it and rip it. Hey. How you doin'? I had some great duck last night. Do I know you? You see that girl? -Yeah.\N-That's Kat Stratford. I want you to go out with her. Yeah, sure, Sparky. Look, I can't take out her sister\Nuntil Kat starts dating. You see, their dad's whacked out.\NHe's got this rule where the girls... That's a touching story. It really is.\NNot my problem. Would you be willing\Nto make it your problem if I provide generous compensation? You're gonna pay me\Nto take out some chick? -How much?\N-Twenty bucks. Fine, 30. Well, let's think about this. We go to the movies, that's 1 5 bucks. We get popcorn, that's 53. And she'll want Raisinets, right? So, we're looking at 75 bucks. This isn't a negotiation.\NTake it or leave it, Trailer Park. Fifty bucks and we got a deal, Fabio. Great practice, everybody. -Good hustle, Stratford.\N-Thanks, Mr. Chapin. Hey there, girlie. How you doin'? Sweating like a pig, actually.\NAnd yourself? Now, there's a way to get\Na guy's attention, huh? My mission in life. But obviously, I struck your fancy,\Nso, you see, it worked. The world makes sense again. -Pick you up on Friday, then.\N-Oh, right. Friday. Well, the night I take you places\Nyou've never been before. Like where?\NThe 7-Eleven on Broadway? Do you even know\Nmy name, screw boy? I know a lot more than you think. Doubtful. Very doubtful. We are screwed. Hey, I don't want to hear\Nthat defeatist attitude. -I want to hear you upbeat.\N-We're screwed! -There you go.\N-Hey, Coach Chapin! Run, Bogey! Have you ever considered a new look? I mean, seriously. You could\Nhave some definite potential buried under all this hostility. I'm not hostile. I'm annoyed. Why don't you try being nice? People wouldn't know what to think. You forget,\NI don't care what people think. Yes, you do. No, I don't. You don't always have to be\Nwho they want you to be, you know. I happen to like being adored,\Nthank you. Where'd you get the pearls? They're Mom's. And you've been what,\Nhiding them for three years? No. Daddy found them\Nin a drawer last week. So you're just gonna start\Nwearing them now? It's not like she's coming back\Nto claim them! Besides, they look good on me. Trust me. They don't. Nice ride. Vintage fenders. Are you following me? I was in the Laundromat.\NI saw your car. I came over to say hi. Hi. -Not a big talker, huh?\N-Depends on the topic. My fenders don't really whip me\Ninto a verbal frenzy. -You're not afraid of me, are you?\N-Why would I be afraid of you? -Well, most people are.\N-Well, I'm not. Well, maybe you're not afraid of me, but I'm sure\Nyou've thought about me naked. Am I that transparent? I want you, I need you.\NOh, baby, oh, baby. What is it, asshole day? -Do you mind?\N-Not at all. You bitch! Whoops. "Whoops"? My insurance does not cover PMS! Well, then tell them I had a seizure. Is this about Sarah Lawrence? Are you punishing me because\NI want you to stay close to home? Aren't you punishing me\Nbecause Mom left? You think you could\Nleave her out of this? Fine.\NThen stop making my decisions for me. I'm your father. That's my right. So what I want doesn't matter. You're 1 8.\NYou don't know what you want. And you won't know\Nwhat you want till you're 45, and even if you get it,\Nyou'll be too old to use it. I want to go to an East Coast school! I want you to trust me\Nto make my own choices, and I want you to stop trying\Nto control my life just because you can't control yours! Yeah? Well, you know what I want? We'll continue this later. Can't wait. Did you just maim Joey's car? Yeah. Looks like you're gonna\Nhave to take the bus. Has the fact\Nthat you're completely psycho managed to escape your attention? Daddy! -When I shell out 50, I expect results.\N-Yeah, I'm on it. Watching that bitch violate my car\Ndoesn't count as a date. Now, if you don't get any,\NI don't get any. So get some. I just upped my price. -What?\N-Hundred bucks a date. -In advance.\N-Forget it. Well, forget her sister, then. You better hope you're as smooth\Nas you think you are, Verona. -Go.\N-No, you go. I went before. We know what you're trying to do\Nwith Kat Stratford. Is that right?\NWhat do you plan to do about it? -Help you out.\N-Why's that? The situation is, my man Cameron here\Nhas a majorjones for Bianca Stratford. What is it with this chick?\NShe have beer-flavored nipples? -Hey!\N-I... I think I speak correctly when I say that Cameron's love is pure, purer than, say, Joey Donner's. I'm in this for the cash.\NDonner can plow whoever he wants. Okay, there will be no plowing. Patrick... Pat... Let me explain something to you here. We set this whole thing up\Nso Cameron can get the girl. Cameron. Joey's just a pawn. So, you two are gonna\Nhelp me tame the wild beast. Absolutely. We'll do some research,\Nwe'll find out what she likes. We're your guys. And he means that in\Na strictly non-prison movie type of way. Let's start here. Now, Friday night,\NBogey Lozenstein is having a party. It's the perfect opportunity. -Perfect opportunity for what?\N-For you to take out Kat. I'll think about it. And for a little payback. This is gonna be some party. Let's do this. Now, this is really important, okay? Which one do you like better? I think I like the white shirt better. -Yeah, it's... It's more...\N-Pensive? Damn. I was going for thoughtful. So, are you going to\NBogey Lozenbrau's thing on Friday night? Yeah, I might. Good, 'cause you know, I'm not\Ngonna bother if you won't be there. See you there. -Okay.\N-All right. So, have you heard\Nabout Bogey Lowenstein's party? Yes, and I really, really,\Nreally want to go. But you know I can't.\NNot unless my sister does. Yeah, I know.\NI'm working on that, but so far, you know, she's not going for my guy. -She's not a...\N-K.D. Lang fan? No. I found a picture of Jared Leto\Nin her drawer once, so I'm pretty sure she's not\Nharboring same-sex tendencies. Okay, so that's the kind of guys\Nshe likes... Like, pretty guys. I don't know. All I've ever heard her say is that she'd die\Nbefore dating a guy that smokes. Okay, all right, no smoking. What else? You're asking me\Nto investigate the inner workings of my sister's twisted mind? I don't think so. Well, nothing else has worked. We need to go\Nbehind enemy lines here. Okay, here we go. Class schedule, reading list, date book, concert tickets,\Nconcert tickets. Black panties! What does that tell us? She wants to have sex someday,\Nthat's what. You... She could just like the color. You don't buy black lingerie\Nunless you want someone to see it. So... Can I see your room? No. A girl's room is very personal. Oh, okay. -Nice bike.\N-Yeah, you think so? Wow. Is this what a bar looks like? Don't touch anything.\NYou may get hepatitis. So, what have you got for me? A little insight\Ninto a very complicated girl. Excuse me.\NJust one question before we start. Should you be drinking alcohol\Nwhen you don't have a liver? -What?\N-Nothing. Nothing. All right, first thing. Kat hates smokers. So, you're telling me I'm a non-smoker. -Yes. Well, just for now.\N-And here's another problem. Bianca said that Kat likes pretty guys. Are you telling me I'm not a pretty guy? He's very pretty! -This is a gorgeous guy.\N-I just wasn't sure. I didn't know. All right. Yeah, okay. Here's this. "Likes. "Thai food, feminist prose\Nand angry girl music "of the indie rock persuasion." Here's a list of CDs\Nshe has in her room. So, I'm supposed to buy her\Nsome noodles and a book and sit around listening to chicks\Nwho can't play their instruments, right? Have you ever been to Club Skunk? Her favorite band's\Nplaying there tomorrow night. I can't be seen at Club Skunk, all right? But she'll be there. She's got tickets. Assail your ears for one night. She has a pair of black underwear. If that helps. Couldn't hurt, right? Verona! What are you doing here? I need agua! Two waters. If you're planning on asking me out,\Nyou might as well just get it over with. Do you mind?\NYou're kind of ruining this for me. You're not surrounded by\Nyour usual cloud of smoke. I know. I quit.\NApparently they're bad for you. You think? You know, these guys\Nare no Bikini Kill or the Raincoats. But they're not bad. -You know who the Raincoats are?\N-Why, don't you? I was watching you out there before.\NI've never seen you look so sexy. -Come to Bogey's party with me.\N-You never give up, do you? Was that a yes? -No.\N-Well, then, was that a no? -No.\N-I'll see you at 9:30 then! Should have used the window. -Hi, Daddy.\N-Hi. Where are we going? Well, if you must know,\Na small study group of friends. Otherwise known as an orgy? Mr. Stratford, it's just a party. And hell is just a sauna. Do you know anything about a party? -People expect me to be there.\N-Kat's not going, you're not going. Why can't you be normal? -Define "normal."\N-Bogey Lozenstein's party is normal. -What's a Bogey Lozenstein?\N-Bogey's party is just a lame excuse for all the idiots at our school\Nto drink beer and rub up against each other in hopes of distracting themselves\Nfrom the pathetic emptiness of their meaningless... -Meaningless, consumer-driven lives.\N-Meaningless, consumer-driven lives. Can you, forjust one night, forget that you're completely wretched\Nand be my sister? Please? Come on, Kat. Please do this for me. Fine. I'll make an appearance. -It's starting.\N-It's just a party, Daddy. I want you to wear the belly. Daddy, no. Not all night. Just around the living room for a minute\Nso you can understand the full weight of your decisions. -I am perfectly aware...\N-Listen to me. Every time you even think\Nabout kissing a boy, I want you to picture wearing this\Nunder your halter top. You are so completely unbalanced. -We're going now.\N-All right, wait a minute. No drinking, no drugs, no kissing, no tattoos, no piercings,\Nno ritual animal slaughters of any kind. Oh, God, I'm giving them ideas. Daddy! -What are you doing here?\N-9:30, right? -Oh, I'm early.\N-Whatever. I'm driving. Who knocked up your sister? So then, Bianca says that I was right, that she didn't wear the Kenneth Coles\Nwith that dress because she thought that it was\Nmixing genres, right? And the fact that I noticed,\Nand this is a direct quote, listen, "Really meant something." You told me that part already. I've been thinking about her\Nall the time. Stop being so self-involved\Nfor one minute. How do I look? You look like my Great Uncle Milton. -You think I should lose the tie?\N-Yeah. Maybe you're right. I'm just so nervous. And I'm also very excited.\NI'm nervous, I'm excited. It's all very mixed up.\NI don't know what to do! All right, just calm down, all right? The last party I went to\Nwas at Chuck E. Cheese. You want to talk about some fun.\NThat's a good time. Now, remember, guys.\NDon't touch anything. What did I tell you? Must be Nigel with the Brie. You know, I'm...\NI'm thinking of getting a Tercel. Yeah, that's a Toyota. It has dual side air bags\Nand a spacious back seat. -Kiss me!\N-Kiss him. -Okay.\N-Good. Hey, thanks, man! Sweet. Looking fresh tonight, pussycat. Wait. Was that...\NDid your hairline just recede? -Hey, where are you goin'?\N-Away. -Your sister here?\N-Stay away from my sister. Oh, I'll stay away from your sister. But I can't guarantee\Nshe'll stay away from me. -Fight!\N-Fight! You guys, please! Take it outside! Thank you! Hey, Kat. Look who found me. -Bianca, wait.\N-Please do not address me in public. No, there's something I need to tell you. I am busy enjoying my adolescence,\Nso scamper off and do the same. Bu-bye. Want one? -What is this?\N-Right on, sister! I've been looking\Nall over the place for you. I'm getting trashed, man. Isn't that\Nwhat you're supposed to do at a party? I don't know.\NI say do what you want to do. Funny. You're the only one. Later. Lord of the dance! Hi, Heather. -Bite me.\N-Should've kept the tie. Hey. Hey, have you seen her\Naround anywhere? -Relax.\N-Relax? I'm fine. Follow the love. Hi, Bianca. Oh, hi, Cameron. You know Chastity? Yeah. I think\Nwe have art together, right? Neat. So, you... You really look amazing. -Thanks.\N-And we all know I look amazing. Yeah. Bianca, let's go. We're all\Ncongregating around Mr. Cuervo. I'll see you around, okay? So, I've got\Nthe Sears catalog thing going, and the tube sock gig,\Nthat is gonna be huge. And I'm up for\Na hemorrhoid cream ad next week. I know it sounds kind of bogus, but... I get to do some acting. You see what I did there? That was underwear. I'll show you\Nthe bathing suit one again. You see the difference? All right, I'll show you guys. Is it me, or does this party\Nall of a sudden suck? Really, really, thank you! Hey. Hey, Kat, why don't you\Nlet me have this one, huh? No! This one's mine. My man! How did you get her to do it? -Do what?\N-Act like a human. Yeah! All right! Go! See this? -Are you okay?\N-I'm fine. You're not fine. Come on. I just need to lie down. You lie down and you'll go to sleep. -Sleep is good.\N-Not if you have a concussion. Come on. Here, sit down. -Sit.\N-Hey, hey, we need to talk. -I'm a little busy right now.\N-Can you give me a second? -What?\N-It's off, okay? The whole thing's off. What are you talking about? She never wanted me.\NShe wanted Joey the whole time. Cameron, do you like the girl? -Yeah.\N-And is she worth all this trouble? I thought she was, but, you know, I... Well, she is or she isn't. See, first of all,\NJoey is not half the man you are. Secondly, don't let anyone\Never make you feel like you don't deserve what you want. Go for it! -Come on.\N-Why? This is so patronizing. Leave it to you to use\Nbig words when you're smashed. -I don't think so.\N-Kat. -Why are you doing this?\N-I told you. You may have a concussion. You don't care if I never wake up. -Sure I do.\N-Why? Because then I'd have to start\Ntaking out girls who actually like me. -Like you could find one.\N-Oh, see? That, there. Who needs affection\Nwhen I have blind hatred? -I just... Let me sit down for a while.\N-All right. There. -So, why'd you let him get to you?\N-Who? -Joey.\N-I hate him. Well, you've chosen the perfect\Nrevenge, mainlining tequila. -Well, you know what they say.\N-Nope. What do they say? No, no, no, no. Kat, come on, wake up!\NLook at me! Listen to me, Kat! Open your eyes! Hey. Your eyes have a little green in them. I don't know if we should go. Hey, a bunch of us\Nare going to Jarrett's. Ready? I have to be home in 20 minutes. Well, you know I don't have to be home\Ntill 2:00, so... -One more chance.\N-Man, I can't. -Damn.\N-That's a shame. -You wanna go?\N-Sure. -Chastity!\N-Hey, you passed. Bitch. -Hey. Have fun tonight?\N-Tons. Hey, Cameron? Do you think you could\Ngive me a ride home? I should do this. -Do what?\N-This! -Start a band?\N-No, install car stereos. Yeah, start a band.\NMy father would love that. You don't strike me as the type that\Nwould ask your father for permission. -Oh, so now you think you know me?\N-I'm getting there. The only thing people know\Nabout me is that I'm scary. Yeah, well, I'm no picnic myself. So what's up with your dad?\NIs he... Is he a pain in the ass? No, he just wants me to be\Nsomebody that I'm not. -Who?\N-Bianca. Oh, Bianca. No offense or anything... I mean\NI know everyone "digs" your sister, but she's without. You know, you're not as vile\Nas I thought you were. Maybe we should do this another time. You never wanted\Nto go sailing with me, did you? Yes, I did. No, you didn't. Okay, no, not actually... Well, then that's all you had to say. Have you always been this selfish? Yes. You know, just 'cause you're beautiful, that doesn't mean that you can\Ntreat people like they don't matter. I mean, I really liked you, okay. I defended you\Nwhen people called you conceited, I helped you when you asked me to, I learned French for you and then\Nyou just blow me off so you could... And I'm back in the game! Kat, me lady.\NYou szay to the rhythm of me heart. Dance for me, cozgirl. Kat, babe, what do we oze you\Nfor the table dance? All right, not that I give a damn,\Nbut how was everybody's weekend? Oh, I don't know.\NMaybe we should ask Kat. Unless she kicked the crap\Nout of your dumb butt, I don't wanna hear about it. Okay, let's open up our books\Nto page 73, Sonnet 141. And listen up. "In faith, I do not love thee\Nwith mine eyes "For they in thee\Na thousand errors note "But 'tis my heart that loves\Nwhat they despise "Who, in despite of view,\Nis pleas'd to dote" Now, I know Shakespeare's\Na dead white guy, but he knozs his shit,\Nso we can overlook that. I want you all to write\Nyour own version of this sonnet. Yes, Miss I-Have-An-Opinion-\NAbout-Everything? Do you want this in iambic pentameter? You're not gonna fight me on this? No, I think\Nit's a really good assignment. You're just\Nmessin' with me, aren't you? No, I'm really looking forward\Nto writing it. Get out of my class. -What?\N-Out. Get out! -Thanks, Mr. Morgan.\N-Shut up. Hey. Cool picture. What's that collar for? Is that\Nto keep him from licking his stitches? Kidding. No, because I know\Nyou're a fan of Shakespeare. More than a fan. We're involved. Okay. "Who could refrain\NThat had a heart to love -"and in that heart..."\N-"Courage to make love known." -That's Macbeth, right?\N-Right. So, listen, I... I have this friend, and he likes your friend... What did you do to her? I didn't do anything. She would've been\Ntoo drunk to remember. But the plan was working. What do you care?\NI thought you wanted out. Yeah, well, I did, but that was until she kissed me. -Where?\N-In the car. Sorry. -Dweeb! Putz!\N-I'm sorry. All right, I talked to her. -I got the scoop.\N-What'd she say? "Hates him with the fire\Nof a thousand suns." That's a direct quote. Thanks, Michael.\NThat's very comforting of you. We don't know.\NShe could need a day to cool off. Maybe two. Hey! Can you imagine who would go\Nto that antiquated mating ritual? I would, but I don't have a date. Do you really want\Nto get all dressed up, so some Drakkar Noir-wearing dexter\Nwith a boner can feel you up while you're forced to listen\Nto a band that by definition blozs? All right, all right, we won't go. It's not like I've got a dress anyway. You're looking at this\Nfrom entirely the wrong perspective. We're making a statement. Oh, goody.\NSomething new and different for us. -Hey there, Cupid.\N-Hi, Joey. You're concentrating awfully hard\Nconsidering it's gym class. -Can I help you?\N-I want to talk to you about prom. Look, you know the deal.\NI can't go if Kat doesn't go. Your sister is going. -Since when?\N-Let's just say I'm taking care of it. This should take care of the\Nflozers, the limo, the tux, everything. Just make sure she gets to the prom. Do you know what?\NI'm sick of playing your little game. Okay, wait, wait, wait. You sick of, let's say, 300? Excuse me. Have you\Nseen The Feminine Mystique? I've lost my copy. -What are you doing here?\N-I heard there was a poetry reading. -You're so...\N-Charming. Wholesome. Unwelcome. You're not as mean as you think\Nyou are, you know that? And you're not as badass\Nas you think you are. Someone still has her panties in a twist. Don't for one minute think that you had\Nany effect whatsoever on my panties. Then what did I have an effect on? Other than my upchuck reflex, nothing. You're right, she's still pissed. "Sweet love, renew thy force" Hey! Don't say shit like that to me.\NPeople can hear you. Look, you embarrassed the girl. Sacrifice yourself on the altar of dignity\Nand even the score. Listen, don't say shit like that to him. People can hear you. You're just too good to be true Can't take my eyes off of you You'd be like heaven to touch l wanna hold you so much At long last love has arrived And l thank God l'm alive You're just too good to be true Can't take my eyes off of you l love you, baby And if it's quite all right\Nl need you, baby To warm the lonely night\Nl love you, baby Trust in me when l say Oh, pretty baby Don't bring me down, l pray\NOh, pretty baby Now that l found you, stay\Nand let me love you, baby Let me love you You look pretty nervous. Yes, sir. You're szeating like a pig. Yes, sir. Your eyes are all bloodshot. Yes, sir. You've got pot, don't you? I'm confiscating this. This, too. Mr. Chapin, can I talk to you\Nfor a second? What can I do for you, Stratford? I have some ideas on how\Nwe can improve the girls' soccer team. Great! Let's talk about it later. The window. As you know, we have\Na really big game with Hillcrest High... Your bicep is huge! Oh, my God.\NThe other one's even bigger. You don't take steroids, do you,\Nbecause I've heard steroids can severely disintegrate\Nyour package? Not that I'm thinking about\Nyour package. -That's not the point.\N-Let's hope not. The point is they kick our butts\Nevery year. I was thinking, I devised a plan that\Nwill enable us to finally defeat them. Which is? -That thing that you taught us.\N-What thing? -Misdirection.\N-I taught you that? Yeah, you or Siegfried or Roy?\NAnyway, that's not important. The... Think about it. They're looking left\Nand we're running right. Bang, we score. We win. Okay, but how do we get 'em\Nto look left? Like this. Okay. Well, now that you've seen "the plan," I'm gonna go and show "the plan"\Nto someone else. Okay. Hi. I can't thank you enough\Nfor helping me sneak out of detention. -Very cool.\N-No problem. I thought for sure I was busted when I\Nwas climbing out that window, I tell ya. So, how did you keep him distracted? I dazzled him with my wits. -So, what's your excuse?\N-For? For acting the way we do? I don't like to do what people expect. Why should I live up to other people's\Nexpectations instead of my own? So, you disappoint 'em from the start\Nand then you're covered, right? Something like that. -Then you screzed up.\N-How? You never disappointed me. Are you up for it? Up for what? All right, come on. No, none of that stuff is true. -State trooper.\N-Fallacy. Dead guy in the parking lot? Rumor. The duck? Hearsay. Bobby Ridgezay's balls? Fact. But he deserved it.\NHe tried to grope me in the lunch line. -Fair enough.\N-The accent? It's real.\NI lived in Australia until I was 1 0. -With the Pygmies?\N-Close. With my mom. Where were you last year?\NI know the porn career is a lie. Do you? -Tell me something true.\N-Something true. I hate peas. No. Something real.\NSomething no one else knozs. Okay. You're szeet, and sexy, and completely hot for me. You are amazingly self-assured.\NHas anyone ever told you that? I tell myself that every day, actually. -Go to the prom with me.\N-Is that a request or a command? Come on. Go with me. -No.\N-No? Why not? Because I don't want to.\NBecause it's a stupid tradition. Come on.\NPeople won't expect you to go. Why are you pushing this? What's in it for you? So now I need to have a motive\Nto want to be with you? You tell me. You need therapy, you know that? Has anyone ever told you that? -Anszer the question, Patrick.\N-Nothing! There is nothing in it for me, just the pleasure of your company.\NOkay? Wait. Wait a minute.\NThat... That's not on this page. Seven! Good. -Daddy?\N-Hi, honey. I'd like to discuss tomorrow night\Nwith you. As you know, it's the prom... The prom? Kat has a date? Well, no. Don't think you're fooling me. I know who you wanna\Nbend the rules for. It's that hot-rod Joey. What's a hot rod? It's a... If your sister's not going,\Nyou're not going. End of story. Okay, let's review. Kat, not interested, me, dying to go. Do you know what happens at proms? Yes, Daddy. We'll dance,\Nwe'll kiss, we'll come home. It's not quite the crisis situation\Nyou imagine. Kissing, huh?\NThat's what you think happens? Got nezs for you. Kissing isn't what keeps me up to\Nmy elbozs in placenta all day long. Can we for two seconds ignore the fact\Nthat you're severely unhinged, and discuss my need for a night\Nof teenage normalcy? What's normal?\NThose damn Dazson's River kids, sleeping in each other's beds\Nand whatnot? -Daddy, that is so not...\N-Got nezs for ya. I'm down. I've got the 4-1 -1 . And you are not going out\Nand getting jiggy with some boy. I don't care how dope his ride is. My mama didn't raise no fool. Thanks, Bill. Ridiculous amounts of love\Nacross this nation worldwide. Believe it. This is the true story. Seattle. Come in. Listen, I know... I know you hate having to sit at home\Nbecause I'm not Suzy High School. -Like you care.\N-I do care. But I'm a firm believer in doing\Nsomething for your own reasons, and not someone else's. Well, I wish I had that luxury. You know, I'm the only sophomore\Nthat got asked to go to the prom, and I can't go\Nbecause you don't feel like it. Joey never told you\Nthat we went out, did he? -Yeah, okay.\N-In ninth, for a month. -Why?\N-Because he was, like, such a babe. -But you hate Joey.\N-Now I do. So, what happened? Please tell me you're joking. Just once, right after Mom left. Everyone was doing it, so... I did it. Afterwards I told him I didn't want to\Nanymore because I wasn't ready, and he got pissed and he dumped me. After that I szore I'd never do anything just because everyone else\Nwas doing it. And I haven't since, with the exception of Bogey's party and my stunning\Ndigestive pyrotechnics. How is it possible\Nthat I did not know about this? I warned him that if he told anyone, the cheerleading squad would find out\Nhow tiny his dick is. Okay, so why didn't you tell me? I wanted to let you\Nmake up your mind about him. Then why did you help Daddy\Nhold me hostage? It's not like I'm stupid enough\Nto repeat your mistakes. I guess I thought I was protecting you. By not letting me experience\Nanything for myself? Not all experiences are good, Bianca. You can't always trust\Nthe people you want to. Well, I guess I'll never know, will I? Ladies with thinning hair or bald spots, G.L.H. solves the problem instantly.\NG.L.H. is not a paint or a cover-up. lt's an amazing powder that clings\Nto the tiniest hairs on your head. lt actually builds on itself, leaving you with great,\Ngreat-looking hair. And the G.L.H. hair system\Nis not expensive. Interesting. Order your G.L.H. hair package now. Bye, Dad. I'm going to the prom. Funny, szeetie. lt instantly covers your bald spot\Nleaving you with great looking hair. -What's that?\N-A prom dress. I seem to be hearing that word\Na lot lately. -Hi.\N-Wow. I... Wow. -Bye, Daddy.\N-Stop. Turn. Explain. Okay. Remember how you said\NI could date if Kat dated? Well, she found this guy\Nwho's actually kind of perfect for her which is perfect for me, because Cameron asked me to go to\Nthe prom and I really, really wanna go, and since Kat went, I guess I'm allozed\Nto, based on the aforementioned rule, and its previous stipulations, of course. -Nice to meet you.\N-Let's go. I know every cop in town, bucko! This is not good. Wow. You, too. Where'd you get a tux\Nat the last minute? Oh, just something I had,\Nyou know, lying around. Where'd you get the dress? Oh, just something I had,\Nyou know, lying around. Listen, I'm really sorry\Nthat I questioned your motives. I was wrong. You're forgiven. Okay. -Ready for the prom?\N-Yes, ma'am. Hi, Mr. Stratford. I'm Joey.\NI'm here to pick up Bianca. -Have you seen him?\N-Who? William.\NHe asked me to meet him here. Oh, Mandella,\Nplease tell me you haven't progressed to full-on hallucinations. -Milady.\N-Good sir. Oh, my God, it's... I called in a favor! What are you doing here? I know you didn't think you were\Nthe only sophomore at the prom. Joey just picked me up. Oh, well, congratulations.\NHe's all yours. Very generous, princess. And just so you know,\NJoey only liked you for one reason. He even had a bet going\Nwith his friends. He was gonna nail you tonight. -Milwaukee.\N-What? That's where I was last year.\NI wasn't in jail. I don't know Marilyn Manson and I didn't sleep with a Spice Girl,\NI don't think. You see, my grandpa, he was ill\Nso I spent most of the year on his couch watching Wheel ofFortune\Nand making SpaghettiOs. End of story. No way. Hey. What's Bianca doing here\Nwith that cheese dick? I didn't pay you to take out Kat so some\Nlittle punk could snake me with Bianca. Nothing in it for you, huh? The shit hath hitteth the faneth. Joey, pal, compadre? You messed with the wrong guy,\Nand now you're gonna pay. You and that little bitch. All right, that's enough, okay!\NYou crossed the line. Oh, come on! Get up, you little punk! Shit, Bianca!\NI'm shooting a nose spray ad tomorrow! That's for making my date bleed!\NThat's for my sister! And that's for me. Are you okay? Never been better. Would you give me a chance... You were paid to take me out\Nby the one person I truly hate. I knew this was a set-up! Kat, it wasn't like that, okay. What was it like, a down payment now\Nand a bonus for sleeping with me? No, I didn't care about the money!\NI cared... I cared about you. You are so not who I thought you were. You want? Thanks. So, you sure you don't want\Nto go sailing with us? It'll be fun. No, I'm fine. Look, I don't know if I ever thanked you\Nfor going last night, but it really meant a lot to me. I'm glad. -Hey.\N-Hey. You ready? -See you later.\N-Bye. -Is... Is she okay?\N-I hope so. Where's your sister going? She's meeting some bikers,\Nbig ones, full of sperm. Funny. So, tell me about this dance.\NWas it hoppin'? Parts of it. Which parts? The part where Bianca\Nbeat the hell out of some guy. Bianca did what? What's the matter,\Nupset that I rubbed off on her? No, impressed. Fathers don't like to admit it\Nwhen their daughters are capable of running their own lives. It means we've become spectators. Bianca still lets me play a few innings.\NYou've had me on the bench for years. And when you go to Sarah Lawrence,\NI won't even be able to watch the game. When I go? Oh, boy. Don't tell me\Nyou changed your mind. I already sent 'em a check. All right, I assume everyone\Nhas found time to complete their poem, except for Mr. Donner, who has an excuse. Shaft, lose the glasses. All right, anyone brave enough\Nto read theirs aloud? I will. Lord, here we go. "I hate the way you talk to me\Nand the way you cut your hair "I hate the way you drive my car\NI hate it when you stare "I hate your big dumb combat boots\Nand the way you read my mind "I hate you so much it makes me sick\NIt even makes me rhyme "I hate it...\NI hate the way you're always right "I hate it when you lie "I hate it when you make me laugh\Neven worse when you make me cry "I hate it when you're not around\Nand the fact that you didn't call "But mostly, I hate the way\NI don't hate you, not even close "not even a little bit, not even at all" -Nice, huh?\N-A Fender Strat? Is it for me? Yeah, I thought you could use it,\Nyou know, when you start your band. Besides,\NI had some extra cash, you know. Some asshole paid me\Nto take out this really great girl. Is that right? Yeah, but I screzed up. I... I fell for her. Really? It's not every day you find a girl who'll flash someone\Nto get you out of detention. Oh, God. You can't just buy me a guitar\Nevery time you screw up, you know. Yeah, I know. But there's always drums and bass\Nand maybe even one day a tambourine. And don't just think you can... No offense. I know everyone "digs"\Nyour sister and all, but she's without. You know, you're not as vile\Nas I thought you were. You suck. Okay. Let's go! You're just messin' with me,\Naren't you? No, I'm really looking forward\Nto doing it. Go see Miss Perky. -What?\N-Go. Perky's. Go, now. Once again.\N"Perky, now" is the second one. -Perky's now. Perky's, now.\N-Right away. -Now, Perky's.\N-Hey, hey. -Now, Perky's. Perky's now.\N-At the beginning of the shot. Perk... Bianca, let's go. We're all\Ncongregating around Mr. Cuervo. I'll see you around, okay? Don't worry. There's better for you, and it's right here. Come here.\NNo, I wanted you for so long. You messed with the wrong guy,\Nand now you're gonna pay. You and that little bitch. All right, that's enough, okay!\NYou crossed the line. What, are you kidding me? -I'm driving, so I pick the tunes.\N-And it's my car. I want some coffee! Could I get a prophylactic? A prophylactic. -Let go!\N-How could you set me up like that? Oh, God, I just wanted... To completely damage me,\Nsend me to therapy forever? -No, I just wanted...\N-Ladies. Shall we go to my office? Oh, my God!
