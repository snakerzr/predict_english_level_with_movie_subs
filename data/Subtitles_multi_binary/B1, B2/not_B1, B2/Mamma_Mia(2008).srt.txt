Now, I may look like I'm pondering\Nmy securities, but in reality, I'm trekking across\Nsome remote corner of the planet. You should try it for real sometime. No, certainly, I'll never be\Nthe spontaneous adventurer. - You're a close friend of Donna's?\N- No, I haven't heard from her for 20 years. - Really?\N- And then this invite, out of the blue. You know, that's a coincidence,\Nneither had I. - Going about!\N- You got it! Right. Wait...\NI've got it. Fine. Fine. You should have brought\Nthe iron lung.

Oh, please, I'm getting married.\NI'm not joining a convent! - She's feisty. I love that.\N- Yeah. She's a chip off the old block. If she were more like me,\Nshe wouldn't be getting married at 20. Or married at all. I meant to get the laundry down\Nbefore you came. Tanya's going home! And you'd think with all this\Nnew technology, they would figure out a machine\Nthat would make the beds. And if they did,\Nyou'd be going along behind it, making them again. I know you, Mom. But I am good at modern...\NTell them about the Internets. - He's gonna put me on the line.\N- Online. I'm designing a website. I just think this place has so much potential,\Nand no one knows we're here. So, if I market it really, really well, then,\Nhopefully, people will come flooding in. We just want this to be\Nthe ultimate romantic destination. This was once supposed to be\Nthe site of Aphrodite's fountain, you know, the goddess of love.\NAnd if you drank the water, you were supposed to find true love\Nand perfect happiness. - I'll have a glass of that.\N- Yeah, I'll have a bucket. <i>Aphrodite's spa?</i> Well, I thought you didn't want\Nboatloads of tourists. Oh, no, not boatloads, no. But, you know, a few more would be nice. Okay, now, the thing about the toilet, if it doesn't flush right away, just go\Nand come back in a while, and it should... Nothing works around here, except for me. I've been running this hotel for 15 years,\Nand I have never had a day off. Oh, my God!

Just more plumbing\Nto be maintained, isn't it? Yeah. Oh, God, I'm so glad\Nthat whole part of my life is over. You know, seriously. I do not miss it at all. Then it's just right here. Good. Where's Donna? Hey! Okay. Up you go. Hmm. You know, I don't want to seem ungrateful\Nfor the scenic tour, but might I be shown my room now? Well, don't hold your breath, Harry,\Nbut I think this is your room. Can we see Donna now? I sent the invites. My mom doesn't know anything. Well, she's done so much for me,\Nand she's always talking about you guys and the good old days, and I thought, what an amazing surprise for her that you are all gonna be at my wedding. Hang on, Sophie. I can't be here. The last time I saw your mother, she said she never wanted to see me again. That was years ago.\NPlease, it would mean a lot to me. - Why?\N- Listen, I can see that you've been to a great deal of trouble. Might I suggest that we all reconvene\Non your boat? - Good idea.\N- Nope. - Why?\N- It's an adventure, Harry. - It's good for you.\N- Oh, I see. Okay, when I sent the invites,\Nit was a long shot that you'd even reply. And now you've come all this way\Nfor a wedding. Surely there must have been\Nsome special reason for you to be here.

Okay. What is this? It's one of those serendipitous moments\Nin life when three complete strangers share a common thought. Strangers? - You don't know each other?\N- That's generally the definition. Okay, good, but who... Why are you here? Who said that you could\Nstay up in my old goat-house? - Didn't catch the name.\N- Greek lady. - Well, she spoke Greek.\N- Yeah.

Sam Carmichael, Bill Anderson and Harry "Head Banger." Harry "Head Banger." They must've gone\Nback to their boat. I hope they run aground and drown. What are they doing here? It's like some hideous trick of fate. It's very Greek. - Do they know about Sophie?\N- What are they, psychic? No! I've never told a soul. Oh, Donna,\Nkeeping it to yourself all these years. It doesn't matter about me. The only thing that matters\Nis that Sophie never finds out. Well, maybe she would be cool with it. "Cool with it"?

Don't you sound like your mother? - I do not!\N- Yes, you so do! - Oh, my God, I do not.\N- You do, it's Catholic guilt! You've been living like a nun. Yeah, whatever happened to our Donna?

Why don't you pursue this?\NYou have a real talent here. I have enough to do here. Is that really your dream? Running the villa with Donna? She just can't do it by herself. Do you know, I drew this whole place up\Non the back of a menu one night. I always dreamt I'd come back here. What kept you? What's your mother said about me? - She never mentioned you.\N- Sophie? What am I doing here? Some air in here. Somebody up there has got it in for me. I bet it's my mother. Oh,\Nand wasn't she a ray of sunshine. I'm gonna go get them out of here. You go in there guns loaded,\Nthere's gonna be questions. - Help me out of these boots.\N- Come on, then. All that fricking yoga's\Nmade my feet bigger. Now, listen.\NListen, what we're gonna do is, we'll get them plastered tonight, and then tomorrow,\NTanya and I will take them fishing. Fishing? Oh, please. What do you suggest\Nwe do with three men?

I'd have loved a daughter.\NI'd have spoiled her rotten. - Is your father here?\N- I don't know. I don't know who my father is. <i>Is there a man out there?</i> <i>Someone to hear my prayer?</i> This is fantastic! How on earth did Donna get money\Nto buy this place? She was left some money by the old lady\Nshe looked after when I was little. - Sofia, that I'm named after.\N- My great-aunt Sofia? I guess. I always heard her money was left to family. - How old are you?\N- I'm 20. Will you excuse me a minute? I'm sorry. Bill! Bill, wait. Why did your great-aunt\Nleave my mother money? I don't know!

I have been tossing and turning all night.\NI've got three dads coming to my wedding, and I have to tell two of them\Nthey're surplus. Only, which two? It's all under control. I'm taking Bill and Sam fishing... We're each gonna go off.\NWe're gonna grab a man, interrogate him, swap notes and decide. And Harry's talked Tanya into water sports. Oh, God.\NNurse, donkey testicles, quickly! - No, after you. Please.\N- No. No. Go ahead. No, no, no, no, you first. - I want to get something off my chest.\N- Me, too. Last night,\NI discovered something wonderful. It was a wake-up call,\Na way to look at myself and what I really want out of life. Last night? You didn't know? You didn't even suspect that you were... Well, no. Of course not.\NThat's always been a secret. And now we... Say it out loud. No! No! No! It's absolutely hush-hush.\NI mean, for now. All will be revealed tonight. Talking of revelations, last night... You and the little lady?\NI think I know what's going on. - No, you don't. You don't.\N- It's obvious. I saw it from the moment\Nyou clapped eyes on each other. You're kidding. I'm gonna level with you, Harry. I don't think I can do this. Well, she's a wonderful girl, but can I take her on in my life? Bill, where's your spontaneity? It's this... - This family, you know?\N- You don't have to marry her. What? Hey, right in time for breakfast. We're serving up the works here. - Think you just did.\N- Sunny-side up! Lox or ham? I'll just... I'm just gonna... What a mess! - Hey!\N- What? - You okay?\N- Yeah. I'm fine. I'm fine. - Sophie.\N- What? Last night, you and Sky... What's wrong? Tell me. Tell me what's wrong. - I don't know what to do.\N- You know what to do. You don't have to do anything. Not too late, I can still call off the wedding.\NEverybody will understand. Call... Call off the wedding? - Isn't that what you want?\N- No. No. No, that's what you want. - No!\N- Yes! God! Sophie! You just... You have no idea. You never had a wedding. You never did\Nthe marriage-and-babies thing. You just did the baby thing. - Well, good for you.\N- You know, I don't know why - you're going off on me now! I really don't!\N- Because I... - God! I love Sky, and I want to be with him!\N- Good! Great. And I don't want my children growing up\Nnot knowing who their father is. Because it's just... It's crap! Voulez-vous - What are you doing?\N- Stop, you're terrible. Come on, man. What are you talking about? Okay, okay, Sophie's gonna have\Nan absolutely beautiful wedding, right? You're supposed to be helping me. You guys... He's got to get ready. I see you kept my bagpipes. They're supposed to ward off\Nunwanted visitors. Well, you don't need bagpipes to do that. What are you doing here, Sam? This is our dream, remember? - Villa on the island?\N- Yeah. Well, this is my reality. Hard work and a crippling mortgage. Shoot! And a hotel that's crumbling around me. - Look, I'll help... Let me have a look at this...\N- No, that's all right, I can deal my own disasters. Why didn't you tell me\Nit was Sophie getting married? Well, I didn't think\Nit was any of your business. Why is she getting married?\NSettling down on the island? I mean, if it was up to me,\NI'd be telling her to go get a life. - Yeah.\N- She's a bright kid. I know. I know. But, you know, my daughter\Nhas a mind of her own. Oh, yeah. I see that. I see that. - But she's so young.\N- I know. I mean, does she know\Nwhat she really wants? You see, I think part of her\Njust wants to let you know that she isn't going to leave you\Nalone here, on your own. - What do you mean?\N- Donna, look. I have two grown children.\NI know something about letting go. If Sophie felt you were okay on your own, would she want something different\Nfor herself? Okay, here's the thing. I love being on my own. I really do. You know, every morning,\NI get up and I thank God that I don't have some middle-aged,\Nmenopausal man telling me how to run my life. You know, I'm free and I'm single. And it's great. * SOS * <i>Where are those happy days?\NThey seem so hard to find</i> <i>I try to reach for you\NBut you have closed your mind</i> <i>What ever happened to our love?</i> <i>I wish I understood</i> <i>It used to be so nice\NIt used to be so good</i> <i>So when you're near me, darling\NCan't you hear me?</i> <i>SOS</i> <i>The love you gave me\NNothing else can save me</i> <i>SOS</i> <i>When you're gone\NHow can I even try to go on?</i> <i>When you're gone, though I try\NHow can I carry on?</i> <i>You seem so far away\Nthough you are standing near</i> <i>You made me feel alive\Nbut something died, I fear</i> <i>I really tried to make it out</i> <i>I wish I understood</i> <i>What happened to our love?\NIt used to be so good</i> <i>So when you're near me, darling\NCan't you hear me?</i> <i>SOS</i> <i>And the love you gave me\NNothing else can save me</i> <i>SOS</i> <i>- When you're gone\N- When you're gone</i> <i>- How can I even try to go on?\N- How can I even try to go on?</i> <i>- When you're gone\N- When you're gone</i> <i>- Though I try how can I carry on?\N- Though I try how can I carry on?</i> Donna must be tearing her hair out,\Ndoing this wedding on her own.

Soph. I've done something completely insane. All my dads are here for our wedding,\Nand they all think they're giving me away. All your what? I read Mom's diary,\Nand I have three possible fathers.

I have no idea.\NAnd now, my mom is gonna kill me, - and they're gonna hate me, and you...\N- Hold on. Hold on. You invited these guys\Nand you didn't tell me? No, I thought you would try to stop me. - I know I messed up.\N- Sophie? Is that what this whole\Nbig white wedding is about? - You finding your dad?\N- No. No! I wanted to take a boat to the mainland\Nwith a couple of witnesses. And you insisted on this sodding circus\Nso you could play Happy Families. It's about knowing who I am. And I wanted\Nto get married knowing who I am. That doesn't come from finding your father, that comes from finding yourself. And the irony is,\NI was travelling to find myself. I put everything on hold for you. Because I loved you\Nand I wanted what you wanted. Now, I don't know. You don't know if you love me? Of course I love you.\NI just wish you'd told me. Is everything okay? - Sophie, what's wrong?\N- Not now, Sam. Yes, yes, yes, now. Because I'm supposed to be\Ngiving you away. And how can I when I know\Nyou're not really gonna be happy? I've heard all this from my mother, and\NI think she knows me better than you do. I know. But I've done the big white wedding,\Nand believe me, - it doesn't always end in "happy ever after."\N- That is you. That's not me. Okay? I love Sky more than anything\Nin the world. And I... Did you feel that way\Nbefore you got married? No. Hey, aren't you supposed to be\Ngetting dressed? Where's Ali and Lisa?\NI thought they were going to help you. Will you help me? Mmm-hmm. Wait.

I couldn't go home, you know. When I got pregnant, my mother told me\Nnot to bother coming back. And I wouldn't have had it any other way. My God, look at what we've had. Will you give me away? Yeah. <i>Sometimes I wish</i> <i>That I could freeze the picture</i> <i>And save it from the funny tricks of time</i> <i>Slipping through my fingers</i> <i>Schoolbag in hand</i> <i>She leaves home in the early morning</i> <i>Waving goodbye</i> <i>With an absent-minded smile</i> Donna!

Am I getting this right? Sophie may be mine,\Nbut she may be Bill's or Harry's? Yeah, yeah. That's right.\NAnd don't get all self-righteous with me, because you have\Nno one but yourself to blame.

It's all right.\NYou don't have to. No, no, I just wanted to say it's great\Nto have even a third of Sophie. I never thought I'd get\Neven that much of a child. Donna, you were the first girl I ever loved. Well, actually, you were\Nthe last girl I ever loved. Now, this gives me an excuse\Nto come here much more often. We can find out if you want, but I'm with Harry. - Being a third of your dad is great by me.\N- By me, too. I'll take a third. Typical, isn't it? You wait 20 years for a dad,\Nand then three come along at once. Dearly beloved... You know, I have no clue which one of you\Nis my dad, but I don't mind. Now, I know what I really want. Sky, let's just not get married yet. - What?\N- What? You never wanted this anyway. I know that. Let's just get off this island\Nand just see the world. Okay? All right? I love you. Donna, do I take it the wedding\Nis cancelled? I'm not entirely sure\Nwhat's happening right now. Hang on. Why waste a good wedding? How about it, Sheridan? You're going to need someone\Nto boss around on this island of yours. Are you nuts? I am not a bigamist. Neither am I.
