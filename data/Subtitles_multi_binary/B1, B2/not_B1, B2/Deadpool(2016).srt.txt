My first request\Nis warmer hands. Oh! And, Jesus,\Na warmer table. We should really come up\Nwith a safe word, fellas. I'm thinking\N"pork and beans." (GROANS) Easy. Aren't you a little\Nstrong for a lady? I'm calling wang. (BREATHING HEAVILY) What's up with the matches? Oral fixation\Nor just a big Stallone fan? (MUFFLED GROAN) Patience, Angel. All in good time. Are you here for\Nthe turndown service, or what? We have another talker. I'm just excited about my\Nfirst day at superhero camp. Shut the fuck up. Mr. Wilson, my name's Ajax. I manage this workshop. Ah, my welcome speech used to\Nbe full of euphemisms like... "This may hurt a little." "This may cause you\Nsome discomfort." But I've grown blunt. This workshop is not\Na government-led program. It's a private institution that turns\Nreclamation projects like yourself... into men of\Nextraordinary abilities. But if you think super-human\Npowers are acquired painlessly... Wrong.\N(GROANS) I'm injecting you\Nwith a serum... that activates any mutant\Ngenes lurking in your DNA. For it to work we need to\Nsubject you to extreme stress. (WADE GROANING) You've heard that whole "make an omelet,\Nbreak some eggs" bit, right? I'm about to hurt you, Wade. I was a patient here once\Nmyself, you know. The treatment affects\Neveryone differently. It made Angel\Ninhumanly strong. In my case,\Nit enhanced my reflexes. Also scorched my nerve endings,\Nso I no longer feel pain. And, in fact,\NI no longer feel anything. (MUMBLING) Thanks! Thank you. Thank you. You have something\Nin your teeth. Right in the middle there.\NJust, I don't... A little nugget of romaine\Nlettuce or something. (SIGHS) It's been bothering me\Nfor a long time. (LAUGHS) Ah, made you look. Hey, is Ajax\Nyour actual name? Because it sounds\Nsuspiciously made up. What is it, really? Kevin? Bruce? Scott? Mitch? The Rickster? (in British accent)\NIs it Basil Fawlty? Oh, joke away. One thing that never\Nsurvives this place is a sense of humor. We'll see about that. I suppose we will. He's all yours. Oh, come on. You're gonna leave me\Nall alone here. With less-angry\NRosie O'Donnell? (GROANS) FRANCIS: <i>This is how\Nit's going to work.</i> <i>Adrenaline acts as a catalyst\Nfor the serum...</i> <i>so we're going\Nto have to make you suffer.</i> FRANCIS: <i>If you're lucky,\Nthe mutant genes will activate</i> <i>and manifest in\Na spectacular fashion.</i> (GASPS) FRANCIS: <i>If not, well, we'll\Nhave to keep on hurting you...</i> (WADE SHIVERING) <i>in new and different ways,</i> <i>each more painful\Nthan the last...</i> until you finally mutate. Or die. CUNNINGHAM:\NYou mean a bucket list? WADE: Like a fuck-it list. I'd really like\Nto light a spliff off the Olympic torch. CUNNINGHAM: Pass it\Nto me right after. Let's not forget naked\Ntandem base-jumping with the WNBA's\NSacramento Monarchs. Anything on my bucket list\Nwould involve public nudity. Finally, giving Meredith\NBaxter-Birney a Dutch oven. No. Receiving a Dutch oven\Nfrom Meredith Baxter-Birney. (LAUGHS) Making banana pancakes\Nfor my kids. Vanessa. WADE: <i>I wanna see Vanessa.</i> FRANCIS: You're lovely. I don't know about\Nanyone else, but I'm touched. We were just joking. No, no. It's okay. I encourage distractions. Wouldn't want you giving up\Non us, now would we? Hey, don't take any shit\Nfrom him, Cunningham. How tough can he be... with a name like Francis? Francis? WADE: That's his legal name. (CHUCKLING) He got "Ajax"\Nfrom the dish soap. F, R, A, N, C, I... Oops! Snagged the dry cleaning tag\Noff your lab coat. FYI, I could probably get you\Nthe superhero discount. You are so\Nrelentlessly annoying. Thanks. Never heard that before. Why don't you do us all\Na favor and shut the fuck up? Or I'll sew\Nyour pretty mouth shut. Oh... I wouldn't do that\Nif I were you. See, here's the problem with round-the-clock torture... is that you can't really\Nstep it up from there. Is that what you think? If this doesn't unlock\Nyour mutation, then, well... nothing will. Now, what we're going to do is lower the oxygen\Nconcentration in the air... to the exact point you feel\Nlike you're suffocating. If your brainwaves slow, meaning you're\Nabout to pass out... then we'll turn up the O2. If your heart rate slows... meaning you're able\Nto catch your breath... we'll turn it back down. And that's where\Nwe'll leave you. Right there. Oh, and I thought\Nyou guys were dicks before. FRANCIS: You know\Nthe funniest part of this? You still think we're making\Nyou a superhero. You. A dishonorable discharge. Hip-deep in hookers. You're nothing. Little secret, Wade. This workshop\Ndoesn't make superheroes, we make super-slaves. We're gonna fit you\Nwith a control collar and auction you off\Nto the highest bidder. Who knows what\Nthey'll have you doing? Terrorizing citizens,\Nputting down freedom fighters. Maybe just mow\Nthe occasional lawn. What the fuck\Nis wrong with you? You're never going home\Nafter this. Now there's a brave face. Wait, wait! Wait. Wait. Seriously, you actually have\Nsomething in your teeth now. Enjoy your weekend. "Weekend"? Back up. Weekend? (MACHINE HISSING) (GASPING) (CHOKING) (EKG BEEPING) (CHOKING)\N(EKG BEEPING RAPIDLY) WADE: <i>Did I say\Nthis was a love story?</i> <i>No, it's a horror movie.</i> (SCREAMING) (GASPING) FRANCIS: Fucking hell. Looks like someone lost his\Nshot at Homecoming King. What have you done to me? I've merely raised\Nyour stress levels high enough\Nto trigger a mutation. You sadistic fuck! I've cured you, Wade. Now your mutated cells\Ncan heal anything. It's attacking your cancer\Nas fast as it can form. Yeah, I've seen similar\Nside-effects before. I could cure them... but where's the fun in that? Now, I'm gonna\Nshut you in again, Wade. Not because I need to. Because I want to. (BREATHING HEAVILY) Oh, well. Go ahead. Oh, you smell like shit. (GRUNTS)\NWhoa! (LAUGHS) ANGEL DUST: Motherfucker. Hey, hey, hey.\NIt's all right, it's all right. I think we owe him\Nthat one, yeah? You take off. Go on. Off you go. Quick question. What's my name? Didn't think so.

Ah, bullshit! I'm a monster inside and out.\NI belong in a fucking circus. Wade, Vanessa loves you.\NShe doesn't care what you... Oh! Oh. Do you like what you see? No. You look like an avocado had sex with an older,\Nmore disgusting avocado. Yeah. Not gently.\NLike it was hate-fucking. There was something wrong\Nwith the relationship... and that was\Nthe only catharsis that they could find\Nwithout violence. And the only guy\Nwho can fix this fugly mug... is the British shitstick\Nwho ran the mutant factory. And he's gone. Poof! Yeah, well you gotta do\Nsomething to remedy this... because as of now, you only have\None course of action. Damn straight. Find Francis.\NStar in horror films. What? Star in your own horror films. Because you look\Nlike Freddy Krueger face-fucked\Na topographical map of Utah. Here's what\NI'm actually gonna do. I'm gonna work\Nthrough his crew until somebody\Ngives up Francis... force him to fix this, then\Nput a bullet in his skull... and fuck the brain hole. I don't wanna see that\Nor think of it again. But the douchebag does\Nthinks you're dead, right? Yeah. That's good.\NYou should keep it that way. What, like, wear a mask? Yes. A very thick mask.\NAll the time. I am sorry... you are haunting. Your face is\Nthe stuff of nightmares. Like a testicle with teeth. You will die alone. I mean, if you could die. Ideally, for others' sake. That'll do.

Over a lifetime, there are\Nonly four or five moments that really matter. Moments when you're\Noffered a choice. To make a sacrifice,\Nconquer a flaw, save a friend... spare an enemy. In these moments... everything else falls away. The way the world sees us. The way we... (RETCHING) Why? You were droning on. Sure, I may be stuck looking\Nlike pepperoni flatbread... but at least fuckface\Nwon't heal from that. If wearing superhero tights... means sparing psychopaths... then maybe I wasn't\Nmeant to wear 'em. Not everyone monitors\Na hall like you. Just promise... Yeah, yeah,\NI'll be on the lookout for the next four moments. (WHISPERS) Oh, shit. Now, if you'll excuse me,\NI'm just a boy, about to stand\Nin front of a girl... and tell her... What the fuck\Nam I gonna tell her? Well, hmm,\Nyou better figure it out. I can't even tell you...\N(GRUNTS) I deserved that.\NThat, too. No, no, no,\Nmaybe not the nethers. Start talking! I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. (STUTTERS) For everything,\NI'm sorry for leaving... I'm sorry for not\Ncowboying up sooner. It's been rough\Ncouple of years. Rough? I live in a crackhouse. With a family of 12. Every night\Nwe spoon for warmth. Everybody fights for Noelle.\NShe's the fattest. There's nothing\Nthat we don't share. Floor space, dental floss,\Neven condoms. So, you live in a house. I should have come\Nand found you sooner. But, baby,\Nthe guy under this mask, he ain't the same one\Nthat you remember. You mean this mask? And this one. In case the other fell off. All right.\NYeah, just... Ow. Like a Band-Aid,\Njust give it a... Owdie 5,000. Wait, wait, wait... Are you sure? I'm sure. Wow. Yeah. Hey. After a brief\Nadjustment period... and a bunch of drinks... it's a face... I'd be happy to sit on. I'm not the same\Nunderneath this suit, either. No. Super-penis. COLOSSUS:\NCome on, Wade. Language. Young one is present. What are you still doing? Get out of here.\NGo make yourself useful! You, go be a really\Nbig brother to someone. Tell Beast to stop\Nshitting on my lawn. And you,\Nchicken noodle... Nothing compares to you. Sinead O'Connor, 1990.\NSorry. That's all right.\NYou're cool. (GASPS) What in the ass? That was not mean.\NI'm proud of you! We will make an X-Man\Nof you yet, Wade. For a second there, it felt like we were\Nthree mini-lion robots... coming together to form\None super robot. There's a stupid. Yeah. And now, for the moment\NI've all been waiting for. Come here. (POP MUSIC PLAYING) (LAUGHING) Wham! As promised.
