Look at that one!\NThat one looks like a dog. -It is a dog!\N-What? We're not allowed to have dogs\Nin my apartment. Hey I like dogs. We have your dog! -Whoa!\N-Wonder who he belongs to. Sit boy. Hey look he's trained. Shake. Uh-huh. -Speak.\N-Hi there. Did that dog just say "Hi there"? Oh yes. My name is Dug.\NI have just met you and I love you. My master made me this collar.\NHe is a good and smart master and he made me this collar\Nso that I may talk. Squirrel! My master is good and smart. It's not possible. Oh it is\Nbecause my master is smart. -Cool! What do these do boy?\N-Hey would you... I use that collar... ...to talk with.\NI would be happy if you stopped. Russell don't touch that!\NIt could be radioactive or something! I am a great tracker. My pack sent me on a special mission\Nall by myself. Have you seen a bird? I want to find one\Nand I've been on the scent. I am a great tracker.\NDid I mention that? Hey that is the bird. I have never seen one up close\Nbut this is the bird. May I take your bird back to camp\Nas my prisoner? Yes yes take it. And on the way\Nlearn how to bark like a real dog. I can bark. And here's howling. Can we keep him?\NPlease please please! -No.\N-But it's a talking dog! It's just a weird trick or something.\NLet's get to the falls. Please be my prisoner. Oh please oh please be my prisoner! Oh! Here it is.\NI picked up the bird's scent! Wait a minute wait a minute!\NWhat is this? Chocolate. I smell chocolate. I'm getting prunes\Nand denture cream! Who are they?

Squirrel!{\i0} {\i1}Mayhaps you desire{\i0}\N{\i1}to challenge the ranking{\i0} {\i1}that I have been assigned{\i0}\N{\i1}by my strength and cunning.{\i0} No no no. But maybe\NDug would. You might wanna ask him. Yeah. I wonder if he's found\Nthe bird on his very special mission. {\i1}Do not mention Dug{\i0}\N{\i1}to me at this time.{\i0} {\i1}His fooI's errand will keep him{\i0}\N{\i1}most occupied. Most occupied indeed.{\i0} {\i1}Do you not agree with that{\i0}\N{\i1}which I am saying to you now?{\i0} Sure but the second Master\Nfinds out you sent Dug out by himself none of us will get a treat. {\i1}You are wise{\i0}\N{\i1}my trusted Iieutenant.{\i0} {\i1}This is AIpha calling Dug.{\i0}\N{\i1}Come in Dug.{\i0} {\i1}Hi Alpha.{\i0}\N{\i1}Hey your voice sounds funny.{\i0} {\i1}I know I know!{\i0}\N{\i1}Have you seen the bird?{\i0} {\i1}Why yes.{\i0}\N{\i1}The bird is my prisoner now.{\i0} Yeah right! {\i1}ImpossibIe!

Her house is over there\Nin those twisty rocks. She has been gathering food for\Nher babies and must get back to them. Wait. Kevin's just leaving? But you promised to protect her. Her babies need her.\NWe gotta make sure they're together! Sorry Russell.\NWe've lost enough time already. Yeah. This was her favorite chocolate. Because you sent her away\Nthere's more for you. Huh? Kevin? {\i1}Where's the bird?{\i0}\N{\i1}You said you had the bird.{\i0} Oh yes. Oh yes. Since I have said that\NI can see how you would think that. {\i1}Where is it?{\i0}\NUh... Tomorrow.

Yes. {\i1}You lost it!{\i0}\N{\i1}Why do I not have a surprised feeIing?{\i0} {\i1}Well at Ieast you now have Ied us{\i0}\N{\i1}to the small mailman{\i0} {\i1}and the one who smells of prunes.{\i0} {\i1}Master will be most pIeased{\i0}\N{\i1}we have found them{\i0} {\i1}and will ask of them many questions.{\i0}\N{\i1}Come!{\i0} Wait. We're not going with you!\NWe're going to the falls! Get away from me! Get down! Stay! You came here in that? Uh yeah. In a house? A floating house? That is the darnedest thing\NI've ever seen. You're not after my bird are you? But if you needed to borrow\Na cup of sugar I'd be happy to oblige. Well this is all a misunderstanding. My dogs made a mistake. Wait. Are you Charles Muntz? Yeah well yes. THE Charles Muntz? "Adventure is out there!" It's really him! That's Charles Muntz! -It is? Who's Charles Muntz?\N-Him! -Yes! Yes! That's him!\N-I'm Carl Fredricksen. My wife and I\Nwe were your biggest fans. Oh well. You're a man of good taste. Now you must be tired. Hungry? Uh-huh. Now attention everyone! These people are no longer intruders!\NThey are our guests. Follow me.\NI like you temporarily. You do smell like prunes. Whoa! I will not bite you. The small mailman\Nsmells like chocolate. I'm sorry about the dogs. -Hope they weren't too rough on you.\N-We weren't. Go ahead and moor\Nyour airship right next to mine. We're not actually going inside\Nthe Spirit ofAdventure itself? Oh... Would you like to? Would I? Wait up Mr. Muntz. Jiminy Cricket. Not you.\NWhat do we do with Dug? {\i1}He has lost the bird.{\i0}\N{\i1}Put him in the Cone of Shame.{\i0} I do not like the Cone of Shame. Well most of the collection\Nis housed in the world's top museums New York Munich London.\NOf course I kept the best for myself. Did you ever! Will you look at that? Oh yes the Arsinoitherium. Beast charged\Nwhile I was brushing my teeth. Used my shaving kit to bring him down. Oh yeah. Well surprise me. Only way to get it out\Nof Ethiopia at the time was to have it declared\Nas dental equipment. Oh my gosh!\NThe giant Somalian leopard tortoise! Oh you recognize it. I'm impressed. That's an interesting story there. Excellent choice. I found it on safari with Roosevelt. He and I fell into a habit\Nof playing gin rummy in the evenings and did he cheat! Oh he was horrible. {\i1}Master dinner is ready.{\i0} Oh dear. Broken translator. It's that loose wire again.\NThere you go big fella. Thank you Master. I liked his other voice. Well dinner is served. Right this way. So how are things stateside huh? Almost tempted to go back a few times but I have unfinished work here. Please. I hope you're hungry because Epsilon is the finest chef\NI've ever had. Oh Epsilon you've done it again! Yes! Hey! Hey! Oh my Ellie would've loved all this. You know it's because of you\Nshe had this dream to come down here\Nand live by Paradise Falls. I'm honored. And now you've made it. You're sure we're not a bother?\NI'd hate to impose. No no. It's a pleasure to have guests\Na real treat. Treat! Where's the treat!\NTreat! No no. Quiet!\NCalm down calm down. -I want a treat! I want a treat!\N-Hey! I shouldn't have used that word. Having guests is a delight. More often I get thieves\Ncome to steal what's rightfully mine. No! They called me a fraud those... But once I bring back this creature\Nmy name will be cleared. Beautiful isn't it? I've spent a lifetime tracking it. Sometimes years go by\Nbetween sightings. I've tried to smoke it out of that\Ndeathly labyrinth where it lives. You can't go in after it. Once in there's no way out. I've lost so many dogs. And here they come these bandits\Nand think the bird is theirs to take. But they soon find that this mountain\Nis a very dangerous place. Hey that looks like Kevin. -Kevin?\N-Yeah that's my new giant bird pet. I trained it to follow us. Follow you? It's impossible. How? -She likes chocolate.\N-Chocolate? Yeah. I gave her some of my chocolate.\NShe goes gaga for it. But it ran off. It's gone now. You know Carl these people\Nwho pass through here they all tell pretty good stories. A surveyor making a map. A botanist cataloguing plants. An old man taking his house\Nto Paradise Falls. I mean that's the best one yet.\NI can't wait to hear how it ends. Well it's been a wonderful evening\Nbut we better be going. Oh you're not leaving. We don't want to take advantage\Nof your hospitality. -Come on Russell.\N-But we haven't even had dessert yet. The boy's right.\NYou haven't had dessert. Epsilon here makes\Na delicious cherries jubilee. Oh you really must stay. I insist. We have so much more to talk about. Kevin? It's here.
