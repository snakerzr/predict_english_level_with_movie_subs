You said the guard was just\Ngonna wave us through. He will. But let's look the part so\Nthe others don't get suspicious. What the fuck does this guy want? I don't know. But he's honking. - Hi!\N- Just ignore them. Okay, he's really honking and it's making a\Nhuge scene. I think he just wants to say hi. Oh, my God. I don't wanna say hi. They're just waving. If we just wave,\Nhe'll stop. Fine. I'll say hi. Fine. - Hi!\N- Hi! Howdy-doody! Quite a rig you got there,\Namigo. That is quite a rig\Nyou guys have there too. Well, thank you very kindly.\NWe do love her. We don't take her out as often as\Nwe used to when our girl was small. It can be such a bear to carve out quality\Nfamily time but you gotta do it, don't you? Yeah, David and Rose Miller here. Oh. This is my daughter, Casey, right here.\NAnd my son, Kenny. - How handsome.\N- Pleased to make your acquaintance. Don Fitzgerald,\Nmy smoldering wife, Edith... ...and our daughter.

What's that beautiful little baby's name? - This is our little--\N- LeBron. - Name's LeBron.\N- Yup. - Oh.\N- A little French fella. It's our little LeBron. I was against the name at first, but\Nthe missus has a real soft spot... ...for prima donnas who'll never\Nbe as good as Jordan. I can't see the face. - I'm dying to see his face.\N- Sir, pull forward to lane two. - Oh, fuck! Okay, put on the hats.\N- You gotta pull over. - Here we go.\N- Great. - My God, I feel like a fucking idiot.\N- That's the idea. Hey, hey, hey, hey. Everybody smile\Nand follow my lead, all right? I'm gonna take us to the promised land.\NHere we go. Here we go. Steady. - Steady.\N- Shit. Shh. Shh, shh. I got this one. Okay. Everybody just smile. Everybody\Nbe cool. Here we go. Follow my lead. Ahem. You bringing anything\Ninto the United States, sir? Yuh-- Sir, are you bringing any contraband\Nback into the United States? Um... - Sir?\N- David! Folks, I need you to pull over and exit the\Nvehicle, please. - But. . ..\N- Sir, is that actually necessary? I mean, these kids\Nare pooped and we've just-- I need everybody out of this\Nrecreational vehicle immediately. - I'l just put the baby down.\N- We'll put the baby away. Bring the child, pull over to the secondary\Ninspection area and exit the vehicle now! - Okay.\N- Good. It's okay. It's all right. It's okay, baby.\NIt's just a puppy. Stand down. All right. It's okay. Before I search the vehicle, is there\Nanything you wanna tell me about? Because after I open that door... ...I can't help you. Last chance. I'm gonna search this vehicle\Ntop to bottom. All right. We got runners! We got runners! Sorry to inconvenience you, folks.\NThis happens a lot. You have a nice day. Go. Go, go! Ah. Well, that was fucking easy! - Oh, my God.\N- God! Whoo! We did it! Nicely done, Millers! Give it up!\NVery good job. Here you go. Rose! Yeah! David! There you go! We are all officially international drug\Nsmugglers. Add it to the resume. Ha, ha.\NHow about a little victory music, huh? Oh, no, no, no. - Don't change it. I love this song.\N- Me too. What? I didn't even like this song\Nwhen it was popular. Come on, loosen up, David. <i>Please stick to the rivers</i> <i>And the lakes that you're used to</i> Don't do this. What? This isn't even\Na good victory song. No, stop. We are not doing this. This is embarrassing. Stop. Ah, come on. <i>I seen a rainbow yesterday\NBut too many storms have come and gone</i> <i>Leavin' a trace of not one God-given ray\NIs it because my life is 10 shades of gray</i> <i>What the fuck?</i> <i>I pray all 10 fade away\NSeldom praise him for the sunny days</i> <i>You claim the insane\NAnd name this place in time</i> <i>For fallin' prey to crime, I swear\NThe system got you victim to your own mind</i> <i>Dreams are hopeless aspirations\NIn hopes of comin' true</i> <i>Believe in yourself\NThe rest is up to me and</i> <i>Don't go chasin' waterfalls</i> - Whoo!\N- Whoo, yeah, Kenny! Where did you learn to do that? Yeah, whatever. <i>Señor Chacon.</i> We were not expecting you. I decided to bring the gringo myself\Nto make sure everything goes as planned. But the gringo has already left with the\Nshipment, señor. What gringo? The gringo with the haircut of a donkey. You mean this gringo\Nwith the haircut of a donkey. I have failed you, señor. If you saw this gringo again would you\Nrecognize him? He was driving an RV with his family. Get in the car. Oh, how fast are you going? Calm down, I'm going the speed limit.\NWe won't get pulled over. No, no. I mean, loaded down like this\Nin a 15-ton vehicle... ...going up a 10 percent grade. Just use your head, David.\NI don't think you think things through. - What?\N- Weight distribution loading and towing. - See?\N- Yeah, I do. I thought this plan through. - Seems to be working out.\N- Oh, great. Oh, Shit! Seriously. God...! Was this part of your plan, David? Damn it. - Wait, what are we gonna do now?\N- I don't kno-- I can't even get a signal. No shit. We're in the fucking middle of\Nnowhere, dude. Oh, gee, thank you, Casey. Thank you for your amazing problem\Nsolving skills. So helpful. Whoa. Hey, what are you doing? I'm not gonna stand on the side of the\Nroad next to an RV filled with pot. I'm gonna try to find help. - Yeah, fuck this. I'm going with her. Bye.\N- What? - Wait up!\N- Ugh. Ridiculous! Okay. Actually, that's fine. Good idea. Okay,\Nhurry back though, please. "Oh, I have a plan." Really? Good plan.\NYou don't have any plans. Women, am I right? Shut the fuck up, Kenny. And he's so smug. Ugh.\NHe drives me crazy. Well, yeah, he's an idiot. No, he's not an idiot.\NHe's actually kind of smart. Why are you defending him? I'm not defending him.\NI'm just saying that he-- Have you seen where we are?\NThis whole plan is so stupid. Oh, really? What golden advice did you follow that\Nended with you on the streets? I don't live on the streets, okay?\NI crash with friends. Ah. Okay. I see. So you were kind of between\Ncouches when David and Kenny found you. Are you gonna lecture me?\NSeriously, I'll puke. You know what, I'm not lecturing you. Okay, good. Because I don't\Nneed advice from a stripper. All right, you know what you little shit?\NI swear-- What the hell is this? Well, look at this\Ncute little couple of hitchhikers. We're here to save your bacon. Saddle up, little ladies. Ha-ha-ha! Hey. Hi, what's going on? They pulled up right after you guys left.\NThey're gonna tow us to a mechanic. They keeping asking to hold\Nthe weed baby. All right, all right, calm down. Okay. Just calm down, all right? I got this.\NWatch. I'm holding that baby. Edie, you will, I promise,\Nbut it's nap time for LeBron. Come on, guys, let's go. All aboard the Fitzgerald Express.\NHonk, honk! Ha-ha-ha!\N- Toot, toot! It's like we're pretending it's a train,\Nbut it's not. - Surrounded by goblins.\N- Okay. Oh, oh, oh! One more sec, okay? Hold on,\None second. Don't freak. When you're a synchronized swimmer... ...you can't use a maxi pad,\Nyou can see it. So my friend bought me a box of tampins. And I'll tell you, I had\Na hard time inserting those. - It would just stick halfway out.\NMm-hm. - It was just like a Roman candle.\NMm-hm. And that is how I found out\NI was born with a shallow vagina. - That was such a detailed story, Edie.\N- Thank you! You gotta do a one-woman show.\NIt's, like, so many layers, you know? So, what's your story, David? - What do you mean?\N- How'd you two meet? Ah! Honey, tell her. And don't leave out\Nany of the romantic parts. Okay. All right. Where did we first meet. Um... It's great. Well, that would have been when Rose\Nmoved into my apartment building. - Ah. That's right.\NMm-hm. I remember watching her through the\Ncrack in my door as she was-- Wait, you were spying on me? Now, hon, just because you've heard it\Na thousand times... ...doesn't mean you should interrupt.\NDon't be rude. All right. Proceed. But, yeah, I was spying on her. She was unloading this U-Haul\Nall by herself. I wanna go help her, but I don't wanna\Ncome off like I'm hitting on her, because... ...you know, I'd like to hit on her\Nmaybe at some point. And, uh... ...she was wearing these little navy\Nblue Chuck Taylors and these jean shorts. No pockets on the back,\Nhowever that happened. And this, uh, Tom Waits T-shirt. I was like, "Oh, that's cool." Because I love Tom Waits. And she just looked beautiful. If you're into that kind of mean,\Npretty thing. So, anyway, uh... ...she starts to bring up this really big\Nweird-looking painting up the stairs. And I'm like, "Okay, here's my shot."\NAll right, so I go outside... ...and I help her with it.\NI'm trying to, at least. She looks at me and goes:\N"Stop it!" - She just snaps at me.\N- You started yanking at it. Next thing you know, it's a tug of war... ...pulling it back\Nand forth and out of nowhere-- His fat fist\Ngoes right through the canvas. - But it was an accident.\N- Doesn't matter! You ruined my painting. Okay. Honestly, I really think\Nyou should've thanked me. Yeah, because that painting\Nwas hideous. My grandfather painted that painting. And it was my favorite thing\Nin the entire world. So we get in this screaming\Nmatch in front of the whole building. And everybody comes out\Nand is watching it. I mean, from that moment,\Nwe hated each other. Oh, man. - And then you fell in love. Oh!\N- Yeah. Then we fell in love. - Ha, ha!\N- Hey, now. I think this is our exit. David, could you grab me the map\Nout of the glove box? Yes, sir. - Whoa. Whoa. Uh...\N- Whoa! Oh, hey, sorry about that, buddy.\NDidn't mean to scare you there. That's just my service pistol and badge. Oh. Your badge. - Are you a cop?\N- No, no, no. No? Oh, God. - I'm in the DEA.\N- Oh. <i>Yeah, my Don has been an agent for the\Nlast 22 years.</i> On a bit of a hiatus at the moment. They took him out of the field,\Nhe wasn't aggressive enough. - That's enough.\N- I'm sorry. It's not right, Don. Those young guns aren't half the\Nagent you are, those crumb-bums. Edith, you know how I feel\Nabout your cussing. - I'm sorry, Don.\N- Edith can be a little hot-blooded at times. - I'm 1/8 Italian, so...\N- Oh. It's okay. Uh, hey, if you guys will excuse me. - Wanna join me?\N- Where are you off to? - We're gonna check on the baby.\N- Gonna take a dump. - Check the baby's dumps.\N- That's what we should say. - Yeah, just go check on Lebanon.\N- LeBron. His name's LeBron. He just has a terrible tummy.\NAnd it's just bad diarrhea stuff. Do we still have cornstarch? Yeah, there's cornstarch for his bottom. - Family meeting.\N- Yep. I'm getting my hands on that baby. He's a narc?\NAre you fucking kidding me?! Stop panicking! We haven't done anything\Nsuspicious yet, so just relax! Oh, really? Okay. What about when they\Nwanna hold our precious weed baby? Give me the baby, all right? I'll handle it if it happens.\NI'll take care of it. Right now, all we have to do is\Nget away from that fucked up family. Oh, fuck. Why are we stopping? They heard us. They heard us.\NFuck, we're going to jail. No, no, no.\NWe're just at the garage, okay? Everybody calm down. We haven't\Ndone anything. You're right. I'll ditch this guy real fast. We're gonna\Nget in and get out of here, okay? Game face, okay?\NMiller time. Here we go. No other repair shops nearby? Run by a Christian and open after\Nsupper on a Saturday night? No, sir. Ah, shoot. I'd give you the hose out\Nof our rig and send you on your way... ...but we'd be stranded ourselves. Besides, this way we can all get to\Nknow each other better. - What's happening?\N- They're closed till morning. Oklahoma. Oh, God. You folks can make camp with the\NFitzgeralds tonight. I know a great spot. We'll set up the old\Ntents and you can bed down in our Winni. <i>- I'll give you a hand with your gear.\N- No, no, no.</i> That's okay.\NMillers carry their own weight. - I knew I liked you, David.\N- Kenny, you wanna get our shit? - Hey.\N- This will be a hoot. I'll watch your little one so you and your\Nman can have some snuggle time. - I don't want you to have to--\N- I am good with babies. Nonsense! Oh, give me the baby.\NGive me that baby! Shit! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God.\NWhy isn't there blood?! Oh, my God! What's happening? Thanks a lot, Mom. Now what am I\Nsupposed to use for my health project? I'm gonna fail and have to go to\Ncommunity college. - My future's ruined!\N- Honey. Mrs. Fitzgerald, are you all right? - That baby was--?\N- Oh, did you think that LeBron was--? Heh-heh-heh.\N- No, no, no. LeBron was a sack of herbs. Oregano and basil mostly. We were just treating it like\Na real baby, a summer project. - Extra credit.\N- It teaches the students that... ...nothing ruins your life like children. Yeah. And it also sends that message\Nto teens, just stick to the big A. - Yeah, anal.\N- Abstinence, you meant. - Neither makes a baby.\N- He confuses them. Anyway, I'm so sorry, Edie.\NWe promised our Casey... ...that we would treat it like a real baby\Nall summer and we went too far. Got used to it. Sorry. And so I'm embarrassed, actually. I think that would scare anybody. <i>She's very emotional. You should have\Nseen her at the end of Free Willy.</i> Oh, stop it, Don. I love that whale. Well, who loves campfire games? Oh, Don. Ladies and gentlemen,\Nit's my pleasure to welcome you... ...to the annual\Nsinging Fitzgerald family jamboree. Our usual guests couldn't be here this year. - Uh, they're called the Osmond family.\N- Ha-ha-ha! But in their place this year we have\Nthe very talented and wonderful Miller family. Let's get this party started\Nwith a Fitzgerald family favorite. <i>Breakin' rocks in the hot sun</i> <i>I fought the law and the law won</i> It always does. <i>I needed to steal some money\N'Cause I had none</i> <i>I fought the law and the law won</i> Now just the Millers. <i>I fought the law and the law won</i> <i>I fought the law and the law won</i> I want you to imagine you committed a felony,\Nyou've been tried and sent to prison... ...and you're standing out in the sun\Nbreaking up rocks with a sledgehammer. And... <i>I fought the law and the law won</i> <i>I fought the law and the law won</i> - All right, that's great.\N- That's good. - That's fun. Great song.\N- I love it. That was great. Great choice. - Great, kids.\N- Well, that was an A for effort. - Whoo! I got the spirit!\N- That's great. <i>It's a bird, it's a plane.</i> - U.S. Air Force, U.S. Air Force. Ollie North!\N- Take me home to-- Looks like a sea animal. Hammer tooth shark. We wait until they fall asleep\Nand then we sneak into their tent, all right? Mm. Cut their throats. - What?\N- What? No. Jesus. - What the fuck's wrong with you?\N- Nothing. I wasn't saying to do that. I didn't say that.\NI thought you were gonna it. You thought I was gonna say\N"cut their throats"? Who do you think I am, Scarf ace?\NGive me a break. - Herbert Walker Bush!\N- Paper airplanes! Clowns. Clown sandwich. Don't lock the baby in the basement. What I was gonna say: We sneak\Ninto the tent, steal Don's keys... ...then we take the RV back to the shop and\NI can swap out their radiator hose for ours. Ah. Got it. - The Earth! The Earth is on fire!\N- Atmosphere. Uh... Plain and simple. Al Qaeda! Al Qaeda! It was "plain and simple." - See, this was a plane, and then this w--\N- Oh, Melissa, of course it was. That is so clever. Gosh, I thought it was really good. I'm a terrible drawer, so... - Great, because you're up next.\N- Ah. - Passing the baton.\N- Nice work. Okay. Let's go, Kenny. DAVID\NAll right, Kenny, here we go. - Draw your brains out.\N- All right, that's a line. - A slash. Guns and Roses.\N- Looks like a spring. What is that? That's a-- Kenny,\Ncome on, draw something, buddy. - String.\N- Come on, son. - Rocket. It's a rocket or...\N- Is that a cucumber? This is really stupid. Is it a bad drawing, Kenny?\NMy guess is "bad drawing." - it's...\N- Oh! A penis! A penis. It's a big dick. Those are balls. It's a big black dick! It's a drawing.\NBlack! It's a big black dick. It's a big, big black cock! <i>Black Cock Down!</i> It's a skateboard. - It's a skateboard, great.\N- A skateboard. Of course it is. - It's a big black skateboard.\N- I see it. Of course. It's very clear.\NBut, you see, it was up-- There's-- Its wheels, so I didn't see it\Ndown on the ground, and then it-- <i>Black Cock Down? Black Cock Down?</i> Nice job, Meryl Streep.\NVery subtle character work. Not my fault that Kenny can't draw. Don't you pick on Kenny. Nothing about that\Nlooked like a skateboard. You leave him alone.\NWhere the hell's Kenny? - You guys, come here.\N- What? - What's going on?\N- Look at these two. - Aww.\NUh-oh. - Guess I'm not the best drawer.\N- No, you were great. - I knew that was a skateboard.\N- Yeah. - I don't know where the confusion was.\N- No, I-- That-- Yeah. I, um, really like your family.\NThey're, uh... - They're different.\N- Well, they're not my family. I mean-- Yeah, no, I get what you mean. - She wants him to kiss her.\N- Absolutely. - She does, right?\N- And sometimes I feel like I'm adopted... ...or an alien, you know, or something. Right. That's what I meant. Um... But also, you know, I\Nwould totally adopt you. You know, um... Not that I wanna be your daddy.\NI just, uh... - He's talking too much.\N- He won't shut up. Uh, well, good night. <i>- I'll see you.\N- Okay. Um...</i> Fucking hug. Okay. And, uh, Melissa? - Yeah?\N- Uh, watch out for bears. Um, you know. Can't see them coming. Good tip. That poor kid.\NWell, you should go talk to him. Who? I said you should go--\NWell, who do you think? Me? What the hell am I gonna say? Talk to him about guy stuff. - Jesus fucking Christ.\N- Come on, how hard is it? Just go. - Hey, man, how you doing?\N- Hey. - Anybody sitting here?\N- Uh, no. Well, good, good, good, good.\NAll right. So, urn... ...I saw what just happened\Nwith you and Melissa. - Oh.\N- Um... You know, you don't have to be scared to\Nkiss a girl. Heh-heh. I mean, you damn near sucked a guy's dick\Nnine hours ago. What are you shy now for? That's not funny, David. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It was a bad joke. Ahem. You wanna know something I used\Nto do when I was your age... ...kept me from\Ngetting nervous around girls? - Yeah.\N- I would just count to three. - Count to three?\N- Yeah. - That's your big advice? Count to three?\N- Yeah. I mean, if you ever wanna kiss a girl\Nor ask her to go out, or I mean... Actually, if you get scared of anything,\Njust do this: just count to three... ...and then do it. Because if you take too long, you overthink\Nit and you'll just drive yourself crazy. Trust me, it'll change your life. I guess that makes sense. - Thanks.\N- Yeah. No problem. And, you know, if you have any other\Nquestions... ...about, like, the birds and the bees... ...who puts what into where,\Nany of that fun stuff... ...just don't hesitate to ask, okay? - Okay.\N- Okay.- - Good talk.\N- Yeah, good talk.

Is it raccoons? God. You were right about them, Edith. - No. I'm so sorry.\N- Let me explain. This is completely explainable. - A misunderstanding.\N- We didn't mean to do this. - You just have to understand something.\NMm-hm, mm-hm. We have never done anything like this with\Nanother couple before. Uh-huh. That's no judgment on you.\NWe're no squares. - I own a vibrator.\N- That's right, she does. - Awesome.\N- I wasn't for it at first. The darn thing's made in China,\Nfor cripes' sake... ...but when you've been married this long\Nyou look for anything to spice things up. So, of course we've discussed a scenario\Nlike this. Yes. And tonight when you brought up\Nthat big black "babymaker"... - Well, we got it.\N- Loud and clear. Our vibrator is named "Joe Morgan." We were picking up\Nwhat you were putting down. Same page.\N- interesting. We're very flattered by this, but right now,\Nin the middle of the night... ...I'm not sure I'm really ready for it.\NAw, Don. Got it. Totally understood. Not a problem. We just had to ask. So... Wait. I have an idea. Okay. Maybe I could take\Na baby step tonight. I mean, my mouth is for my marriage. But I've never touched\Nanother woman before. I would be okay with that. Yeah. Oh, great. Rose? - There you go.\N- Okay. All right, I'm sitting. - Are you okay?\N- David. - Mother to mother, is this okay with you?\N- Yes. "Mother." Yes. - Are you sure?\N- Let's get this mother started. - Shall we? Okay.\NHa-ha-ha! - Okay, Don, are you watching?\N- I'm good. Okay. Uh, wow. My heart's pounding\Nso fast in my chest. - Ahem. So I guess we're swinging.\N- Hmm? Oh, yeah. Ooh. Ha, ha. Sorry that I'm taking so long. Hello. Ha-ha-ha! Okay, I'm just gonna do it real fast.\NThere we go. - There they are.\N- There they are. - Wow! Wow!\N- It's happening. This is happening. Don, are you looking at this?\NI'm touching her boobs. - This is a miracle.\N- Okey-doke. - Would you like to feel my breasts?\N- I think that's enough for tonight. - You're right.\N- Don't give away the farm. - A little roughhouse?\N- We should wait. - Are you okay down there?\N- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Have fun tonight, kids. - Awesome.\N- I'm never gonna wash these hands. Mwah, mwah, mwah! Thank you so much. - Good night. That was great.\N- Okay, bye, guys. Great. What now, genius? - Tell me-- What?\N- Oh, oh, oh. I don't know. I just got earfucked in a tent. If you let her finger bang you\Nthey would have given us the keys. Oh, really? Why don't you go\Nsuck Don's dick for them... ...and then you get the keys?\NHe was certainly loving on those earlobes. Okay, look. First, unlike you,\NI only suck a man's dick if I'm in love, okay? That's kind of a personal rule I have. - Yeah, and secondly... And secondly...\N- What? I don't have a second one.\NI don't know where I was going with that. Fucking idiot. Oh, I thought of one. I got one. Here comes Joe Morgan up to the plate. Oh, Don. Okay, what? What? What do you mean? Do you wanna talk about it... ...or mope around like\Nsomeone kicked you in the vagina? Okay. Um... Well, I've never really like-- Had sex before. Shocker. Kissed a girl before. Wait, what? I thought you said\Nyou were like 18. - Okay, you know what, forget it.\N- Okay, okay, wait. Okay. Come on. Sit down.\NDon't need to be so dramatic. Look, it's okay\Nthat you haven't kissed a girl. I'm sure there are some girls... ...who I've never met... ...that find inexperience\Nkind of sweet. I don't wanna be a sweet, inexperienced\Nguy who's never been worth kissing. I wanna be the guy who grabs a girl\Nand kisses her. You know? Okay, let me make one thing clear. This isn't one of those moments\Nwhere the girl kisses the boy... ...and realizes she's been in love with him\Nthe whole time, okay? You're my fake brother\Nand you're a sweet kid... ...so this is for you\Nto bring back to Melissa. - What is?\N- I'm gonna kiss you, dingus. Oh. - What are you doing? Shut your eyes.\N- Okay, sorry. Right. That's weird. That's really weird. - Sorry.\N- All right. Ahem. That was okay.\NNow more tongue. Tongue. I can do that. Too much tongue. Too much tongue. Right. Too much--\NYeah, that's my fault. My bad. Sorry. Less tongue. That was good. All right, now this time, I want you\Nto choke me a little bit. - Uh, okay.\N- Whoa. What's going on here? Uh, it's-- - We're not doing what it looks like.\N- Really? It looks like Casey's\Nteaching you how to kiss out of pity. Mm-hm. Uh, well, then it is what it looks like, yeah. Really. What did you teach him? The basics.\NHe's never kissed a girl before. You haven't?\NOh. Well, honey, show me. - Uh, really?\N- Yes. Okay. Uh-- Oh. Not bad. It's not bad. - Try this.\N- Okay. Come here. There you go. You feel that?\NWhat I did with my tongue? - Yes, ma'am.\N- Show Casey what you just learned. Look at that. Mm! Whoa! Wait. Hold on. I wanna get a picture of you with\Nthe first girl you ever kissed. Here you go. - Mm-hm. Make it good.\N- Good. Rose. Get in there.\NThere you go. Photobomb it. - This is getting better, it's getting better.\N- Okay. It's so cute. Use your hands. They got\Nso much fun stuff to play with. You're not using your hands. Kenny? - No, Melissa-- It's, uh--\N- I'm sorry. Melissa, wait. Fuck. You know, there's a 50-50 chance\Nshe'll be into it. Redhead. They're crazy. Grab your things, guys.\NKenny, grab my stuff. Thanks. - Here we go.\N- Well, looks like you're ready to roll. Gary called me first thing. He seemed real\Neager for y'all to come pick her up. - Good. Good, good, good. Okay.\N- Guess this is it, then. - Good luck to you, David.\N- Hey, thank you, Don. Take care, will you? Hey, yeah, listen, I would appreciate it\Nif you kept what happened last night... ...all that Chinese vibrator talk, between us. - Yeah.\N- If folks at my church found out about that... Yeah.

Which was\Na pretty shitty thing to do. Even for him. - I'm really sorry about that. That sucks.\N- Whatever. That's what you get\Nfor dating a guy who dates strippers. Ah, come on. You're a lot more than that, Rose,\Nand you know it. - What?\N- Rose is not even my real name. What's your real name? Sarah. With an "h"? Yep. Right there at the end.

What do you say we go home?\NCome on, let's go. Hey, David? Go fuck yourself. Uh--? Ha! "Go fuck yourself."\N"You go fuck yourself." Rose, you say, "Go fuck yourself."

I know what this is about, and I get it. All right?\NWe're gonna split the $500,000. Evenly. Betwixt the four of us. You guys get what I'm saying here?\NKenny, you wanna be like this: "Pfft!" Like you're from-- Right?\NThat's a lot of video games, kiddo. All right, Casey, you can buy a house,\Nand run away from it. You know what I mean? Like, whatever.\NYou get $125,000. You get $125,000. You get a-- I mean, I'm like\Nfucking Oprah here. You know? If she was a white dude at a carnival. Heh. Come on, guys. Let's get in the RV... ...and take our butts back to Denver where\Nwe're gonna be rich and we're gonna get paid. - Come on, come on.\N- Uh, David, listen. You misled us. You left us. And then you come waltzing back in here\Nall...l don't know what the hell that was... ...and you just expect\Nthat we all just forget about it. What's wrong with you? How do we trust you? Okay, look, what do you want?\NDo you want me to beg? Kids? What do you think? - That would make me feel a lot better.\N- Works for me. Sure. You're joking. Wha--? You really want me to get on my knees?\NAnd beg you? It's a good thing I'm wearing\Nmy begging pants. I usually only do this before sex. Okay, okay, I'm going, I'm going.\NPlease, please. Ahem. Let's do it. Here we go. Okay! To the RV, let's go. Come on, Babs. Whoa, whoa. Slow down.\NThere's clowns everywhere. Here, let Pops get in here. We're right down here.\NI parked it next to an RV. - Melissa.\N- Kenny. - Rose!\N- Edie. - Shit.\N- Shit. I never get used to that language. What in the H-E-L-L\Nare you people doing here? Uh...

Why are you being so rude? Do you have your period?\NDo you need a tampin? Mom, I don't need a tampin.\NI don't want to be near these people. - Kenny. Let's go.\N- We should get out of here. - What happened last night was wrong.\N- Oh, boy. Oh, my God, she knows. My daughter knows what we've done. Melissa, yes, it was wrong of me\Nto fondle Mrs. Miller's breasts. You're right. I'm not gonna deny that it\Ngave me a certain amount of pleasure. That said, your father and I are struggling\Nwith some serious intimacy issues. Okay, no, stop! I'm not as tight as I once was. - Look...\N- He just falls right out. It's like throwing a hot dog\Ndown a hallway. Ew! What are you talking about? I saw Kenny making out with his sister\Nand mother while their dad watched. What? Oh, my--! - It wasn't quite like that.\N- That's not exactly what happened. Rose isn't my mom, she's not\Nmy sister. We're not a real family. That's enough, son!\NWhat are you saying? He's been drinking. It's hard\Nto understand. He's being ridiculous. David hired us to help him smuggle drugs\Nacross the border. You're drug dealers? No! No, we're drug smugglers.\NThere's a difference. There's not a difference. Okay, Edie, we can explain, all right? This is a small misunderstanding.\NIt really is. When he says "smuggle," he doesn't\Nknow what he's saying. - It's not drugs.\N- He doesn't know what drugs are. Seriously. It's just a little tequila. What? Oh, my God! - Hey. Ah, thank God you're alive.\N- He's got a gun! Listen! Hey, hey, hey.\NNo, no! Wait, wait, wait! This is gonna be fun! I still got it. Don's a badass. Oh, Don. Melissa, go find a police officer. Okay, Don. Don, listen to me. No. Drug smuggling, David? And to think of the moment we shared. No, Don, there's another guy. I don't want to hear about other men! What? No! No, no! No! There's\Nanother guy trying to kill us! What? Who? Pablo Chacon. Pablo Chacon. <i>Buenas noches, Millers.</i> What is he saying?\NWhat does that mean? It's a familiar Mexican greeting. You in the short jeans\Nand the funny mustache, give me the gun. Melissa. And the mug. Please don't hurt her. - Take her.\N- Are you okay? It's okay. Now the keys, please. Here. Here, here, here. Okay, great. You have your drugs,\Nso you don't have to kill us. Oh, I don't have to kill you, huh? You take my drugs. You make me cross the border into\Nthis fucked-up country. You try to burn my face with steam! - I'm sorry.\N- You destroy my car! And I don't like what you do to my man\Nevery time we meet. You are the worst family I've ever met. But, you're right, I don't have to kill you. I want to kill you. All of you. Stop. Stop. Don't do this. Don't kill these people. This is all my fault. I'm the one that\Ndid this. I'm the drug dealer here. This is an innocent family... ...in the wrong place\Nat the wrong time. Okay? And this kid? This kid's got the biggest fucking heart\NI've ever seen in my life. And I'm lucky to call him a friend. Man, an hour ago, I would have killed\Nthis girl for you. But she's tough as hell.\NAnd a lot smarter than me. And this one. You. Sarah. You're the strongest woman\NI've ever met. And you'd make a great mom. I love all of them. Don't kill them. Please. Just kill me. - Tell you what, I'll make a deal, okay?\N- Okay. I kill you first so you don't\Nwatch your family die. David. Kenny! That was amazing! I'd like to think I taught him that. - Mm.\N- I know I taught him that. Put that tongue back in your mouth,\Nyoung man. Oh. Wow. - You kiss a lot better than my sister.\N- Hey! - One, two, three.\N- Mm-hm. Well, Mr. Chacon, on behalf\Nof the United States of America... ...I'd like to welcome you to our country. Grab a seat. Sorry you won't get to experience\Nthe freedom part. Don, you're my hero. I want you to use those zip ties tonight. Here. Thank you, David. - We're gonna go.\N- Not so fast. - Oh, no, Don.\N- Dad, please. Girls, hush. I believe that you are good people. But you broke the law. All of you. And worse than that, you put my wife\Nand daughter's lives in danger. - Sorry.\N- Gonna have to place you under arrest. - Don, why?\N- No, Dad, don't. And I'm gonna do just that... ...right after I turn around... ...and hug my family. David, come on. It's all here! I am blown away, David. Great job. But it's late. Deadline was last night, so,\Nsorry, buddy, no deal. Brad, I almost got killed\Nover this shit. Twice. I'm not gonna be an asshole about this.\NI got two tons of premium weed. Yes! And you got Chacon\Npinched in the process... ...which is a huge win for team Brad.\N- Mm-hm. So how about we shake hands\Nand call it even. - You were never gonna pay me, were you?\N- Oh! Bingo. Heh-heh. Was that a dick move?\NI can't even tell anymore. - Move!\N- Go! Go! Go! DEA! - Down, down, down!\N- Get on the ground! Freeze! Clear! You double-crossed me. Kind of a dick move, right? You got nothing on me! Nothing at all. Oh, shit! Look at this guy. Who let in 50 Cent? - Nice work, David.\N- Thank you, Don. Now, I know you don't get your money... ...but doing the right thing\Nhad to feel a whole lot better. No. All right, maybe a little bit. As promised, in exchange for your\Ntestimony against Chacon and Gurdlinger... ...we have to keep you in witness protection\Nfor three to six months. - Just me?\N- Just you. Oh. And any other witnesses to the crime. <i>- There you are.\N- I don't care.</i> - Look at this hot nerd.\N- Rub some dirt on it. - What are you doing?\N- Look at this. You gotta tell Casey to stop posting\Nthis stuff. It's already got a million hits... ...and growing. Okay, okay, I'll tell her after lunch.\NOof, you know what else? I can see down your tank top. - Hey there.\N- Hey. - Wanted to introduce ourselves. I'm Dan.\N- Hey, Dan. My wife, Kathy. We just moved in. - Hello.\N- We're the Johnsons. Oh, great.
