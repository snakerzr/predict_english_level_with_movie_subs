Resync: Xenzai[NEF]\NRETAIL Should we help him? He's due in the lists in two minutes.\NTwo minutes or forfeit. Lend us those. Right. Left. -Dead.\N-Eh? Three scores to none after two lances. As long as Sir Ector doesn't\Nfall off his horse, we've won. He's dead. -What do you mean?\N-His life's spark is covered in shite. His spirit is gone\Nbut his stench remains. -Does that answer your question?\N-No, no, no. No, he sleeps. Rouse him. I haven't eaten in three days! None of us have! -Let's fetch a priest.\N-No, he's not dead! You wake up! Come on! Come on! You manky git! Roland. Squire, Sir Ector must report\Nat once or forfeit the match. He's on his way. I haven't eaten in three days! Three days! What did you eat, mate? If you wasn't dead, I would kill you! I'll ride in his place. Strip his armor.\NI'm riding in his place. Wat, stop kicking him!\NI'm riding in his place. Help me. What's your name, William? William Thatcher, answer me\Nwith your name. It's not Sir William. It's not Count or Duke or King William. I know that. You must be of noble birth to compete. A detail. The landscape is food.\NDo you want to eat or not? If the nobles find out,\Nthere'll be the devil to pay. Then pray that they don't. Visor. Come on, we're late. The score stands at three lances\Nto none in favor of Sir Ector. Lord Philip of Aragon. Stand ye ready? Sir Ector. Stand ye ready? Ready? I tilted against Sir Ector many times. ln practice as his target.\NYou never struck him. -Badger me not with details.\N-The landscape. Stay on the horse. He needs 3 points.\NHe has to knock you off the horse. I know how to score, Roland. I've waited my whole life\Nfor this moment. For Sir Ector to shite himself\Nto death? Get it in the cradle. ln the cradle. Get it in the cradle! William, are you alive? -We won! We won!\N-Can you hear me? Get off me! William, can you hear me? We won! He's breathing. He's breathing! Sir Ector. Sir Ector. Remove your helmet. My lord, the final blow of the lance\Nhas bent it onto my head. He says the final blow of the-- I present your champion, my lord. Twenty. No, 10. -Fifteen.\N-Done. Very good. Cheers. Fifteen silver florins.\NHe didn't want that. That's five for William. Five for Wat. Five for Roland,\Nwho's going home to England. Straight to the pub for me.\NEel pie, brie tart... ...tansy cakes with peppermint cream. We could do this. We've done it, boy.\NThat's silver in your hand. No, I mean, we can do this.\NWe can be champions. Give us your coins. Give me your coins. Now, that's one for you. And one...for you. Which leaves 13. That's 13 for training\Nand outfitting. The tournament in Rouen is in a month. We could split a bigger prize. In one month we'd be on our way\Nto glory and riches. Or lying in a ditch with Sir Ector.\NWilliam, I just want to go home. Tansy cakes. Dilled veal balls.\NI'll take my five now. Oh, wait up. You're going the wrong way! You can't even joust. Most of it is the guts to take a blow.\NGuts I have. And technique?\NI have a month to learn that. And name a man better\Nwith a sword than I am. -In the practice ring.\N-You're not of noble birth. So, we lie. How did the nobles become noble\Nin the first place? They took it at the tip of a sword.\NI'll do it with a lance. -A blunted lance.\N-No matter, Wat. A man can change his stars. I won't\Nspend the rest of my life as nothing. That is nothing. And that's\Nwhere glory will take us. We're peasants. Glory and riches\Nare beyond our grasp. But a full stomach?\NThat dream can come true. If you can take your coins,\Ngo eat cake in England. But if you can't, you come with me. You see? Money doesn't matter. See how hungry I am? -Do you?\N-Damn your stomach, Wat! Roland, please. With 1 3 silver pieces,\Nthree men can change their stars. God love you, William. I know, I know. No one else will. Unlucky. -I think he's getting worse.\N-He is getting worse. Switch. Switch. Glory and riches. Glory and riches! You see how dangerous it is? Faster! Faster!\NAll right, use those legs! Come on, Roland. Faster! Faster! -You missed it.\N-You've done it dozens of times. Well, I guess that means\Nwe should do it again. Come on. Come on, ponies. Fong him. Faster. Balance. No, slower. Keep it steady. I got it! Look, I got it! Any minute now. -Yes, better.\N-Nice. -It's my turn to ride.\N-No. We haven't reached the marker.\NAnd you shouldn't. How would it look if my squire rode\Nwhile I walked? I don't give a witch's teat!\NIt's my turn! It's my turn! Maybe nobody should ride.\NThe horse is not what he used to be. Fine. Fine. Morning. Morning. Hoy, sir. What are you doing? Uh...trudging. You know, trudging? To trudge? To trudge the slow, weary... ...depressing, yet determined walk\Nof a man who had nothing left... ...except the impulse to simply\Nsoldier on. Were you robbed? Interesting question. Yes. And at the same time,\Na huge, resounding, '' No.'' It's more a sort of involuntary\Nvow of poverty, really. But on the brighter side,\Ntrudging does represent pride. Pride, resolve and faith\Nin the good Lord Almighty. Please, Christ, rescue me\Nfrom my current... ...tribulations. Who are you? Lilium inter spinas. The lily among the thorns. Geoffrey Chaucer's the name.\NWriting's the game. Chaucer? Geoffrey Chaucer, the writer? -A what?\N-''A what?'' A writer. I write with ink and parchment.\NFor a penny, I'll scribble anything. Summonses, decrees, edicts,\Nwarrants, patents of nobility. I've been known to jot down\Na poem, if the muse descends. You probably read my book,\NThe Book of the Duchess. Well, it was allegorical. We won't hold it against you.\NEach man decides that for himself. Did you say patents of nobility? That's right. I did. And you gentlemen are? I am Sir Ulrich von Lichtenstein\Nfrom Gelderland. These are my faithful squires,\NDelves of Dodgington... ...and Fowlehurst of Crewe. I'm Richard the Lionheart.\NA pleasure. No, I'm Charlemagne!\NJohn the Baptist! All right! Hold your tongue, sir, or lose it. Now you see that, I do believe... ...Sir Ulrich. Thank you, Geoff. Have you any more to say, Master Nude,\Nor may we be on our way? -Off to the tournament?\N-This is the road to Rouen. That remains to be seen.\NThey're limiting the field at Rouen. Noble birth must be established\Nfor four generations on either side. Patents of nobility must be provided. Listen, clothe me... ...shoe me, for God's sake, feed me\Nand you'll have your patents. No. -Patents of nobility.\N-We need him. We need him. -Let me handle it.\N-Be nice. Nice, nice, nice. All right. Betray us and I will fong you\Nuntil your insides are out... ...your outsides are in and your\Nentrails are your extrails. Pain. Lots of pain. I present Sir Ulrich, whose mother's\Nfather was Shilhard von Rechberg... ...son of the Duke Guelph of Saxony,\Nson of Ghibellines, son of Wendish. -Wendish inherited the fief--\N-That'll do, herald. Six generations is more than enough.\NShow me the patents. lndicate in which events\Nshall your Lord Ulrich compete. He'll first meet Roger Lord Mortimer. Thank you very much. I can't believe it.\NYou did it, Chaucer. I thank you. I didn't think\Nwe had a chance. My pleasure, William. If you don't mind, I'll stick around. Be my herald, you'll\Nget part of the winnings. Done. Now if you don't mind,\NI have to see a man about a dog. Walking out from Cheapside My fortunes for to seek I passed along the River Thames It's waters did they reek 'Twas there I met a pretty lass She said her name was Nell Bell or hell rhymes with Nell. Would you speak to me? Ah, to speak. Sir, my sex are marked\Nby their silence. I would hear you speak\Nif it cost me my ears. That is well, for I do not\Nwant silence in my life. Tell me your name. -Would you care if I were ugly?\N-Yes! I mean, no. I mean-- You desecrate the house of God! Tell me your name. And what would you do\Nwith my name, Sir Hunter? Call me a fox, for\Nthat is all I am to you. Then a fox you shall be until\NI find your name, my foxy lady. He's a handsome hunter.\NI give him that. Does this not shock you, ladies? Certainly, my lord. I only laugh just\Nto keep from weeping. Beauty is such a curse. Pray your years come swiftly. Pray your beauty fades\Nso you may better serve God. Oh, I do, my lord. I pray for it all\Nthe time. Why, God, did you curse me\Nwith this face? God's will has a purpose,\Nbut we may not know it. Well, that is lovely. Sir Ulrich von Lichtenstein... ...defeats Roger Lord Mortimer\None lance to none. Easy. They'll think l\Nnever broke a lance before. -But you haven't!\N-Ulrich's broken thousands of lances. Come on. You're due\Nin the sword ring. My armor's loose. Shite. I can't block an overhead. We can't fix it now.\NWe're overdue in the sword ring. It was a mistake to do two events.\NI'm too hurried. -I'll withdraw from the sword.\N-Sword's what you're best at. But the prizes and prestige\Nare bigger in the joust. Ulrich von Lichtenstein?\NI am Simon the Summoner. I'm overdue at the sword ring. I must detain you\Non behalf of your herald. You were never robbed. I have a gambling problem. I can't help myself. And these people will... ...literally take the clothes\Noff your back. What are we supposed to do? He assured us that you,\Nhis liege, would pay us. And who are you? Peter, a humble pardoner... ...and purveyor of religious relics. How much does he owe? Ten gold florins. You manky git! -Pain! Pain! Take the pain!\N-Get him off me! Wat, let him go! What would you do to him\Nif I was to refuse? We, on behalf of the Lord God... ...will take it from his flesh\Nso that he may understand... ...that gambling is a sin. Oh, come on. Please, Will. Please, will you help me,\NSir Ulrich? I promise you won't regret it. I don't have the money. Release him... ...and give him back his clothes. And you'll get it. Done. You lied. Yes, I lied. I'm a writer.\NI give the truth scope! Behold my Lord\NUlrich von Lichtenstein, son of-- -Too late. He's been announced.\N-Fine. Ten blows by sword.\NSir Ulrich to receive first. Strike! Strike! Stop letting him hit you! Shut up! Shut up! Two strikes for Sir Walter Loring! Sir Ulrich to strike! -Now it's your turn!\N-Come on! Strike! I taught him that!\NThat's me! Sir Ulrich prevails,\Nfive strikes to two! Yes! Behold my Lord Ulrich!\NThe rock! The hard place! Like a wind from Gelderland,\Nhe sweeps by! Blown far from his homeland\Nin search of glory and honor! We walk in the garden\Nof his turbulence! Yeah! -You're champion.\N-Of the sword. lsn't that why we're here? Come on. Do you want to touch him?\NDo you want to touch him? We should've saved\Nfor the blacksmith. I can't pay you now... -...but I promise I will, just as..\N-No! Money. -Excuse me.\N-Cash first, not promises. Go on. Excuse me, sir. You might try the farris. A woman? Beggars cannot be choosers, my lord. Thank you. -Excuse me.\N-I don't work for free. -I can't joust with broken armor.\N-That's your problem, not mine. Each drop of this sweat\Nhas a price on it. Just as well. They told me\NI was daft to even ask. -Who?\N-The other armorers. Did they say I couldn't do it\Nbecause I'm a woman? They said you're good\Nwith horseshoes, not armor. No one mentioned you being a woman. Cat's meat! Hot wine! Cat's meat! Hot wine! Lady, I will win\Nthis tournament for you. Nay! I will win for you. May I present Count Adhemar... ...winner of the joust in France\Nand champion at Saint-Emilion. All forgotten when standing before the\Nmost beautiful woman in Christendom. Do you only pretend to fight, Count\NAdhemar, or wage real war as well? I am leader of the free companies.\NMy army is in southern France. Geoff, 'tis my lady. -William, you aim too high.\N-I don't know any other way to aim. -Concentrate.\N-What should I say to her? What do you think of the joust? It's very abrupt. And I don't understand the rules. Then I shall educate you. A match is three lances. One point is given for breaking\Na lance between the waist and neck. Two points for breaking on the helmet.\NIt's difficult. The helmet sweeps back.\NMost blows glance off. Three points for bearing a rider\Nto the ground. Also, if you bear a rider\Nto the ground, you win his horse. Do men die in the joust? Lance points are tipped\Nwith coronals, which blunts them. Of course, accidents happen. I myself, Jocelyn,\Nhave never been unhorsed. Nor have I. Your name, lady. I still need to hear it. Sir Hunter, you persist. Perhaps angels have no names.\NOnly beautiful faces. And you are? I am, um.... Have you forgotten? Or your name is Sir '' Um.'' Ulrich von Lichtenstein\Nfrom Gelderland. I'd forget as well. What a mouthful. -Your armor, sir.\N-What about it? How stylish of you to wear an antique.\NYou'll start a new fashion if you win. My grandfather will be able\Nto wear his in public again. And a shield. How quaint. Some of these poor country knights,\Nlittle better than peasants. --the second son... ...of Sir Wallace Percival,\Nthird Earl of Warwick. My lords, my ladies... ...it is with honor\NI introduce my liege... ...Sir Thomas Colville. You're good. You're very good. My lords... ...my ladies... ...and everybody else here\Nnot sitting on a cushion... ...today... ...you find yourselves equals. For you are all equally blessed. For I have the pride... ...the privilege, nay, the pleasure... ...of introducing to you\Na knight sired by knights. A knight who can trace\Nhis lineage back... ...beyond Charlemagne. I first met him... ...atop a mountain near Jerusalem... ...praying to God... ...asking his forgiveness\Nfor the Saracen blood... ...spilt by his sword. Next, he amazed me\Nstill further in ltaly... ...when he saved a fatherless\Nbeauty... ...from the would-be ravishings\Nof her dreadful uncle. In Greece... ...he spent a year in silence... ...just to better understand\Nthe sound... ...of a whisper. So without further gilding the lily\Nand with no more ado... ...I give to you\Nthe Seeker of Serenity... ...Protector of Italian Virginity... ...the Enforcer of our Lord God,\Nthe one, the only... ...Sir Ulrich von Lichtenstein! Thank you! Thank you!\NI'll be here all week. That was different. It's time we celebrated\Nour differences. Just maybe not in public. You.... Yes, I'm well aware\Na good fonging is on the way. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. I got their attention.\NYou win their hearts. Very good. -Was she watching? Geoff.\N-What? -Did she see me?\N-Yes, she did. -Did she see me take the hit?\N-Yes. -Was she concerned?\N-Her eyes welled up. Just awful. Colville has perfect technique.\NI've never seen him before. Nor I. But this Lichtenstein. His technique, rudimentary.\NStyle, nonexistent. Still, he's fearless. Fearless? How so? The slit in the visor is narrow,\Nbut splinters can penetrate it. Most knights raise their chins\Nat the last instant. You lose sight of your opponent, but\Nprotect your eyes. Ulrich doesn't. He keeps his eye on the target. A true hunter. Sir Ulrich... ...I'm through. But I've never not finished before. I wish to keep my honor intact. A draw. And Colville is hurt. Colville withdraws. Ulrich advances. Why didn't Ulrich finish him? He shows mercy. Then he shows his weakness.\NThat's all mercy is. For the love of victory, William,\Ngo to sleep. I can't. Love has given me wings,\Nso I must fly. I can't explain it. -She makes me feel like a poet.\N-You may feel like a poet... ...but you sound like an idiot. -You don't even know her name.\N-Her name? Her name is Aphrodite. Calypso. Venus. Take your pick. Women weaken the heart. Without your heart, you cannot win. -But her eyes--\N-Concentrate. Tansy cakes! Count Adhemar sends word. He said he will win\Nthis tournament for you. He's won many. He wins them\Nfor himself and his own honor. It's nothing to say\Nhe wins them for me. He wishes to speak to you again. Not to hear a word I say. Adhemar wants his women silent. Would you have Sir Ulrich\Nwin the tournament for you? No. And he is the only knight\Nwho has not promised to do so. Sir Ulrich von Lichtenstein. I would have him win my heart. Adhemar! Adhemar! Adhemar! Oh, lovely. I don't think I've ever seen\NCount Adhemar lose. No, but defeat him\Nand you'll see it firsthand. My liege. Sir Ulrich. Christiana. -My lady bids you wear this token.\N-Of course. She also said to tell you, her name... ...is Jocelyn. -Au revoir.\N-Au revoir. Oh, Jocelyn. Concentrate. I can't breathe. No style whatsoever. But neither has an anvil. -He hits like a hammer. Amazing.\N-But not perfect. He aims high. Roll your shoulder back,\Nhis blow may go right. But if he strikes to my left,\NI'll be obliterated. I didn't say it wasn't a gamble. Ulrich! Ulrich! Ulrich! Ulrich! William? William, here. Come here. Someday I'll be a knight. A thatcher's son? A knight? You might as well try\Nto change the stars. Can it be done, Father? -Can a man change the stars?\N-Yes, William. If he believes enough,\Na man can do anything. Come here. Gain more bearing, Ulrich. See me again when you're worthy. I'll fong you in the arse! Well done, my lord! Well done. -You bastard!\N-Go and see to Ulrich. Go see to Ulrich. Well done, my lord. A noble victory. My lady, I believe this is yours. For long spear on foot... ...Pandolfo Malatesta. For sword on foot,\NUlrich von Lichtenstein. Finally, for the mounted joust\Nand tournament champion... ...Adhemar, Count of Anjou. Adhemar! Adhemar! Adhemar! I present to you your champions. Next time, you will look up\Nat me from the flat of your back. Please. You have been weighed,\Nyou have been measured... ...and you have been found wanting. Keep winning the sword. -I won't compete in it.\N-It's your best. No. It's tournament champion\Nor nothing at all. Ten florins. That should do. Sixes and sevens tonight, Chaucer.\NDo you feel lucky? -Have you enough clothes?\N-Be gone. I'm done with you. Except to exact my revenge. What on earth could you\Npossibly do to us? I will eviscerate you in fiction. Every last pimple,\Nevery last character flaw. I was naked for a day.\NYou will be naked for eternity. I have a feeling we shall meet again. Here, farris, take what we owe you. The armor you wear, it wasn't\Nmade for you, was it? So, what of it? I could make armor you wouldn't\Neven know you wore it. What's the cost? Just take me as far as Paris. We travel alone.\NTake your gold and go. -Get what you can. Let's pack.\N-Why are we leaving so soon? The next tournament is in a week.\NWe can walk now and save the horse. You must go to the banquet.\NYou'll dance and make an appearance. Let Adhemar laugh at me again?\NNo! -Yes!\N-No! My lady would know the color\Nof your lord's tunic tonight. -His tunic?\N-Yes, so she can dress to match him. We regret to inform your lady\Nhe won't be attending-- -Herald, do not give my answers!\N-Yes, my lord. Squire, answer her. What color is my tunic tonight? Green. Trimmed in a kind of... ...pale green... ...with... ...uh, wooden toggles. I will tell my lady. -This is a disaster!\N-No, it'll tunic up quite nicely. That's not a disaster, Roland. I don't know how to dance. And one and two and three and four. Your hand should be light,\Nlike a birdie on a branch. And one, two and three and four. And Wat doesn't lead,\Nhe follows like a girl. And one and two and... ...twirly, twirly, twirly. And one and two, and you're\Nstill getting it wrong. And one and two\Nand three and four. You can hit me all day\Nbecause you punch like a what? A girl. -Enough!\N-Get back! Wat, quiet! -He starts it.\N-You know he's touchy! Oh, and you can do better? -Of course.\N-Then show us. No. If I'm making all this effort,\Nyou'd best ask her nicely. I'm sorry, Kate. I was wondering if you'd care\Nto show us how to dance. -Please.\N-Please. And one and two, three and four. Five, six, seven, change partners. And one, two, three, four... ...five, six, seven. Polonaise. And one.... Are you wearing your hair like that? Is there another way? Sir Ulrich, you look fantastic. Jocelyn, you look.... Uh, you... ...remind me of the Bible. When God stopped the sun to give\NJoshua time to defeat the Amorites. I don't understand. If I could ask God one thing... ...it would be to stop the moon. Stop the moon and make this night... ...and your beauty... ...last forever. What dance will you have? A coranto? Or a basse dance? Sir Ulrich. Why don't you show us a dance\Nof your country? Show us a dance of Gelderland. Yes. Gelderland. Well, it's a lot like the farandole... ...but with some differences. Well, you bow. And... ...and.... Places. Places. What? -I don't know. Too small, too light.\N-He'll be crushed. Killed. No. I found a new way to heat steel.\NIt's thinner, smaller... ...but just as strong. What are these? The marks of my trade should\Nanother knight admire the armor. Twist and bend. Feel the movement. -But eventually I will be struck.\N-And then death. Do you at least have the courage\Nto test it? You okay? I didn't feel a thing. -Who's that knight?\N-Piers Courtenay. He's raised taxes on his land 3 times\Nthis year to pay for tournament. His people starve while\Nhe sits at banquet. It's probably true. Ulrich! Ulrich! Ulrich! Ulrich! Ulrich von Lichtenstein. The Count Adhemar... ...son of Philippe de Vitry... ...son of Gilles... ...master of the free companies... ...defender of his enormous manhood... ...a shining example of chivalry... ...and champagne. Nice work! Bravo! Watch every move Adhemar makes.\NWe'll find a weakness. Well, Colville looks fit. --my liege... ...the second son of\NSir Wallace Percival. It is my deepest honor-- My deepest honor to present to you.... It's Edward, my lord.\NThey're sure of it. --the illustrious Sir Thomas Colville! Adhemar withdrew. To withdraw like that means one thing. Royalty. I'll see what I can find out. Prepare to drop the flag. No, no. Not yet. Wait, listen. Musicians, announce. -I must speak with my lord.\N-Then go. See if you can beat the Second Coming. Wait! Wait! Colville is Edward, the Black\NPrince, future king of England. He's in disguise like me\Nso he can compete. He's never met an enemy without\Nvictory or town he couldn't defeat. We're English! We know who he is! -You must withdraw. Tell them, Geoff.\N-Absolutely! The lance. Give me the lance. Lance! Oh, my giddy aunt. The match is a draw. You mad? You endanger\Na royal family member. He endangers himself. Well fought, Sir Ulrich, as in Rouen. You also, Prince Edward. -You knew me?\N-Yeah. And still you rode? -It's not in me to withdraw.\N-No. Nor me. Though it happens. Yes, it does. -Good luck to you.\N-You also. The winner of the mounted joust and\Ntournament champion... ...Ulrich von Lichtenstein. -Melt it, sell it, do whatever you do.\N-Yes, Your Majesty. You're champion! I'm not champion until\NI defeat Adhemar. He withdrew. Sir Ulrich. -Tell me what you'll wear tonight.\N-Nothing. We'll cause a sensation,\Nfor I'll dress to match. Don't you get tired\Nof putting on clothes? She's talking about taking them off. A flower is only as good\Nas its petals, no? A flower is good for nothing. Really? You can't eat a flower.\Nlt doesn't keep you warm. And a rose never knocked\Na man off a horse either, did it? You're just a silly girl, aren't you? Better a silly girl with a flower than\Na silly boy with a horse and stick. Goodbye. It's called a lance. Hello. -I have word.\N-What? Adhemar was called back\Nto the free companies. Edward commanded it.\NHe could be gone all season. First Jocelyn and now Adhemar. Well done. Yeah, well done. The tournament results, my lord. Ulrich. Ulrich. Ulrich. -Geoff.\N-William. I need to write a letter. '' Dear Jocelyn.'' No.\N'' My dearest Jocelyn.'' Better. '' I miss you.'' Was that wrong? Well, it's up to you, really.\NIt's your funeral, I mean, letter. -Say something about her breasts.\N-You miss them. Her breasts? Yes, you could, but I would tend\Nto look above her breasts. I miss her throat? Still higher. Towards the heavens. The moon. Her breasts\Nweren't that impressive. The moon? The moon. '' lt is strange to think... ...I have not seen you in a month. I have seen the new moon, but not you. I have seen sunsets and sunrises, but\Nnothing of your beautiful face.'' That's very good. I knew this girl once who.... She broke my heart.\NI said the pieces-- ''The pieces of my broken heart can\Npass through the eye of a needle. '' He writes as though I had died. Yes, madame. He dies as well. She used to cook for the Duke of York. I miss her like the sun\Nmisses the flower. ''I miss you like the sun\Nmisses the flower. Like the sun misses the flower\Nin the depths of winter. Instead of beauty to direct\Nits light to... ...the heart hardens like the frozen\Nworld your absence has sent me to.'' ''I next compete in Paris. I'll find it empty and cold\Nif you're not there.'' I like it. And now, to finish it. With '' hope.'' Love should end with hope. My husband, God rest him... ...said something I'll never forget. '' Hope guides me. lt--'' ''It gets me through the day and\Nespecially the night. The hope that after you\Nleave my sight... ...it will not be the last time\NI look upon you.'' Finish it with.: ''With all the love\Nthat I possess...William.'' You mean '' Ulrich.'' ''With all the love I possess... ...I remain yours... ...the knight of your heart.'' My master hoped you might have\Nsomething to send him in return. Cock-a-doodle once! I shall not deny\Nhim. Twice! I shall not. Thrice! I deny him. Thrice he denied him! No Adhemar. No Adhemar. Wat. Tell me, did you see her?\NDid she read the letter? Yes, and yes. And? She's coming to Paris! Did she give you anything for me in\Nreturn? A letter? A token? Did she give me a token? She did. Uh, I mean, um.... Well, what is it? Give it to me. Yes! Hell, yes! She-- Because she's--\NThat means she-- Yeah! Cinquante. That's a nice round number. Ex cusez-moi. They wager that a Frenchman, not\NSir Ulrich, will win the tournament. But the amount is 50 florins. -That's all we got.\N-lf we had 60, it would be that. Ulrich against every Frenchman here? He's won four tournaments in a row.\NAnd Adhemar isn't here. I check shields too.\NJohn Beaumont's here. Count Theobald, Philip of Burgundy--\Nall French champions. Englishmen will not win... ...this French tournament. English legs are unsteady\Non French soil. Shut your mouth, all right? Come on, Roland. It's a good bet.\NWin and I can buy my own tavern. -I could write full-time.\N-A forge for me. And because French wine\Nis too much for English bellies. Listen, I'm about this fonging close,\Nmate. I swear to God, Quasimodo! All I want is to go home, and I've\Nenough for that trip a hundred times. And most importantly, because\Nthe pope himself is French! The pope may be French,\Nbut Jesus is English. You're on. He won't lose with the princess\Nwatching him. He's blond! He's pissed! He'll see you in the lists!\NLichtenstein! Lichtenstein! He's blond! He's tan!\NHe comes from Gelderland! He comes from Gelderland! Gelderland! -You think he will come?\N-As sure as the sun will rise. You favor cathedrals. I come for confession. And the glass. A riot of color in a dreary,\Ngray world. Don't you think? It's beautiful. I feel the same about\Nthe letter you sent. Speak to me. Speak those words. I will win this tournament for you. Excuse me? I'll win this tournament in your name.\NI'll defeat each knight for you. Your beauty will be reflected in the\Npower of my arm and my horse's flanks. Wow. Really? Really? lts flanks? I wish to hear poetry, Ulrich. Well, I'm not ready. I am. Why must everything for\Na woman be run on a man's schedule? Well, a man's day is fuller, and... ...he has more demands on his time. -ls that so?\N-Yes. Maybe. No? I demand poetry... ...and when I want it.\NAnd I want it now. Your breasts... ...they're below your throat.... Jocelyn, how may I prove\Nmy love to you? How? -Do you ask in earnest?\N-Yes. If you would prove your love... -...do your worst.\N-My worst? What do you mean? Instead of winning to honor me\Nwith your high reputation... ...act against your character\Nand do badly. -Do badly?\N-Lose. Losing proves that I'm a loser. Wrong. Losing is a much keener\Ntest of your love. Losing would contradict\Nyour self-love. It would show obedience\Nto your lover and not yourself! -Really?\N-Woman, shh! Do not ''shh'' me and spare him!\NNow be gone! Go! What is your answer? I will not lose. Then you do not love me. The Protector of ltalian Virginity. The Lance that thrilled France... ...the Harasser of Paraser! He gave them hell at La Rochelle! The Enforcer of our Lord God! The one, the only... ...Sir Ulrich... ...von Lichtenstein! God, I'm good! His horse's flanks. Maybe where he comes from,\Nit means love. What are you doing? -Losing.\N-I don't understand. Neither do l. He loves me. Are you blind? -Did you see the flag?\N-I saw it, okay? I know. You're dropping behind\Nfor a more dramatic victory. Look, Jocelyn told me to lose\Nto prove my love. -I'd rather you were blind.\N-Don't be foolish, Will. -Each woman wants proof, that's all.\N-Proof of what? Her legs weren't uncrossed\Nfor nothing. -I haven't uncrossed her legs.\N-Then why are we doing this? Because! Because... ...I love her. -I'm going to lose everything!\N-That's why it's called gambling. Pain! Here's your pain! It's very romantic, though. Are you a woman or a blacksmith? Sometimes I'm both. Ooh, that chafes! Put him down. No knight has distanced himself\Nwith victories. If you win your remaining matches\Nand your opponents take key losses... ...you could make the semis,\Nor the finals. -At least the armor's proven itself.\N-And your love? Have you proven that yet? Wat, you remember church as a boy.\NThe fear, the passion. That's what she makes me feel. And for that, I say my rosary\Nto Jocelyn and no one else. William, that's blasphemous. Then may I burn in hell. Withdraw. Lose that way.\NTake no more punishment. Oh, Roland. My lady sends this message.\NIf you love her-- I know, I know. I must lose.\NIsn't she watching? She says if you love her,\Nyou won't lose again. She says if you love her,\Nyou will win this tournament. There she is, the embodiment of love.\NYour Venus. And how I hate her. -I don't understand women.\N-Nor do I, but they understand us. Maybe not you. Yes! Women, eh? Forty-eight... ...forty-nine... ...and fifty. Thank you, gentlemen.\NA pleasure doing business with you. Look us up if you're in London,\Nthe World Championships, maybe. Don't look too sad.\NHere, have a drink on me. He's quick, he's funny and\Nmakes lots of money, Lichtenstein! Guinevere comes to Lancelot. Bed him well, my lady. Bed him well. We missed you at banquet. ''We''? l. Jocelyn. Your prize. My prize. I am not worthy of a prize. Then who is? My maid tells me that\Nsometimes your varlets... ...call you William. Is this so, Sir Ulrich? Yes. lt is so. Your name makes no matter to me. Just so I can call you my own. But Jocelyn, I am your own. Damn, girl. You need a surgeon. He's been. He says I will live,\Nthough it doesn't feel that way. Oh, William. This pain is my doing. Yes, it is. Although... ...my father... ...taught me to take the bad... ...with the good. This good you speak of. It will be my doing as well. How long since any of you have been\Nback? I've only been gone 6 months. Two years for me. Three years. Five. Five long years. William? Twelve. Twelve years. He's to be an apprentice? How long for? Seven years. Sir Ector? I'm the thatcher. I spoke to you\Noutside London Stadium. Oh, yes. I remember. Is this the boy? Step forward, son. Let me look at you. Careful with that, Roland! Are you afraid of me, boy? Have you got most of your teeth? Show me your arm. ls it strong? Well, he's a half-starved little\Nscarecrow. But he has spirit. I can show you a great wide world\Nfull of adventure... ...and marvels you\Ndo not yet dream of. Can you pack my horse and lead it? Well, come on.\NSay goodbye to your father. He's a real knight, William.\NWatch and learn all you can. It's all I can do for you, son. Now go change your stars\Nand live a better life than I have. Roland, show the boy his duties. -Father? I'm afraid.\N-Of what? I won't know the way home. Don't be foolish, William.\NYou just follow your feet. London. Give us a shout out, London! Ulrich! Ulrich! Ulrich! Ulrich! -Adhemar's here. He's entered.\N-Must have grown bored with war. No, the Black Prince commanded it.\NHe had to disband his army. They were reveling,\Npillaging town after town. Robbing, murdering,\Nransacking churches. Committing the oldest sins\Nin the newest ways. At last we will face each other again,\NSir Ulrich. And at the World Championship. And as I promised you before... ...you will look up at me\Nfrom the flat of your back. Let the past die. You've done well in my absence,\Non the field and off, I'm told. Winning trophies, horses, women. You put them in that order? Generally, with a few exceptions. Beautiful, isn't she? A real thoroughbred trophy,\Ndon't you think? -You speak of her like a target.\N-Isn't she? No. She is the arrow. I've begun negotiations\Nwith her father. I'm to make her my bride. She'll be saddled... ...and placed on my mantle. Target or arrow, it doesn't matter. I will have her. Ulrich! Ulrich! Ulrich! -How would you beat him?\N-With a stick, while he slept. But on a horse? With a lance? That man is unbeatable. Hello there. -You're Sir Ulrich von Lichtenstein.\N-Yes. You're my favorite knight.\NWhen we joust, I always say I'm you. What are you doing in Cheapside?\NThere's no parade today. Can you keep a secret? I was born in Cheapside,\Njust around the corner there. -Truly, Sir Ulrich?\N-Truly. I only live just there. How old are you? -Nine and one half.\N-Nine and one half. I wonder if you remember a man,\Nthough he may have died long ago. He was as tall as a knight.\NHis name was John Thatcher. -Of course I remember him.\N-You do? Yes. He lives there still. Sometimes we see him sitting\Nat the window, but no one knows why. What do you mean? He's blind, sir. Is someone there? If you're here for the net,\NI'm not done yet. Come tomorrow. Who are you? A knight. My name...is Ulrich. Ulrich? I hear that name\Nbeing chanted from the stadium. What business have you here? I have word, Master Thatcher. Word of your son. Of my William? Well, come in, sir. What word? Does he live? Aye. He lives. He is very well. He wanted you to know... ...that he changed his stars\Nafter all. And has he followed his feet? Has he found his way home at last? Yes. Father. Oh, William. Oh, my boy. I should like to meet this Wat.\NAnd Roland too. You will, Father. And what of women?\NIs there a certain one or many? There is a certain one. I should like to meet her too. This leak won't do, Father. -Not in a thatcher's chamber.\N-It's quite fitting for a blind one. Well, a thatcher I am. I'll fix it. Alive. I thought he was dead,\Nwhich is mad... ...because he was also so strong.\NVery strong. -Geoff.\N-Jocelyn. This day just gets better and better. Somebody die? Sir Ulrich von Lichtenstein. Adhemar... ...followed you last night.\NTo Cheapside. He saw your father. Will, they asked me for your patents. They're waiting for you\Nin the lists to arrest you. A dozen royal guards. -They'll put you in the stocks.\N-But I face Adhemar in five minutes. No, you forfeit.\NThey've already marked it down. Saddle the horses.\NThey can arrest your baggage, not you. Halt. So, what do you think... ...now that you know what I am? To know what you are, William,\Nwould take a lifetime. One I am willing to give.\NBut now you must run. Run, and I will run with you. Jocelyn, I cannot run. I am a knight, and I will\Nput myself to the hazard! ln your heart, not on paper.\NAnd paper's what matters to them! William, I love you. I love you. You. -I won't see you led to the stocks.\N-But you'll see me run? No! Damn your pride, William. It is only you that\Nwill not see you run. Pride's the one thing they can't take! But they can take it from you.\NThey can and they will. Oh, they will. But love they cannot take. And where will we live? ln my hovel? -With the pigs inside in winter?\N-Yes, William, with the pigs. With the pigs. The poor can marry for love. Jocelyn, you speak of what\Nyou do not know! William, I beg you. Please. Run. Do it for love. Roland, you would see me run? And you, Geoff? I wish it too, with all\Nthe pieces of my heart. Wat? You and l? We aren't runners. Yes. William, today we are. Run, William. I will not run! I am a knight. Well, boys... ...all good things must come to an end. Let's end them together. You will remove yourself\Nfrom this position of honor. I am here to compete. You are here to be arrested. All right! He that strives to touch a star... ...oft stumbles... ...at a simple straw. You have been weighed. You have been measured. And you have been found wanting. It's one loss or another...William. ln what world could you\Nhave ever beaten me? Leave, Roland. Let them have me. God love you, William. So do I. Go! Disperse! Or I will fong you! As Jesus Christ the Nazarene\Nand his holy mother... ...the Virgin Mary are my witnesses,\NI will fong you! I will rip you! Fist! Pain! I'll stick my fist and break you!\NPain! Lots of pain! We're in trouble. Listen to me. Listen to me! What a pair we make, huh? Both trying to hide who we are. Both unable to do so. Your men love you. If I knew nothing else about you,\Nthat would be enough. But you also tilt\Nwhen you should withdraw. That is knightly too. Release him. He may appear to be\Nof humble origins... ...but my personal historians\Nhave discovered... ...that he descends\Nfrom an ancient royal line. This is my word. And as such, is beyond contestation. Now... ...if I may repay the kindness\Nyou once showed me. Take a knee. By the power vested in me\Nby my father, King Edward... ...and by all the witnesses here... ...I dub thee... ...Sir William. Arise...Sir William. Can you joust? There's my tournament to finish. Now, are you fit to compete,\Nor shall the forfeit stand? I'm fit. I shall have your opponent informed.\NLook for his shield on the lists. At once. Thank you, my lord. All hail Prince Edward! My lords, my ladies... ...and all you other people. I give you the son of Philippe\Nde Vitry, son of Gilles.... -Are you sure?\N-Yes. It's nothing but spun sugar\Nand boot black. It's a small target... ...but aim for his heart. --doer of daring deeds... ...conqueror of countless kingdoms,\NCount... ...Adhemar! Oh, God. I'll get the surgeon. Roland! You're the surgeon. Come on. He tipped it. Kate, get me back to one. Otherwise we forfeit. Dirty son of a bitch! Kate, I can't breathe.\NI can't breathe. As I said, thatcher. In what world could you\Nhave ever beaten me? Such a place does not exist. She's here William. With your father. Change your stars. Let's dance, you and I. It's two lances to none. You must unhorse him or kill him.\NIt's the only way to win. -You need more padding.\N-No, leave it off. I can't breathe with it on. Lance. I can barely grip it. Damn. Lash it to my arm. Wat... ...lash it to me arm. Do it. Good people! I missed my introduction! But please... ...please, I pray you. Hear it now. For I would lay rest... ...the grace in my tongue... ...and speak plain. Days like these... ...are far too rare to cheapen\Nwith heavy-handed words. And so, I'm afraid,\Nwithout any ado whatsoever-- Excuse me, my lord. Here he is! One of your own! Born a stone's throw from\Nthis very stadium... ...and here before you now. The son of John Thatcher... ...Sir William Thatcher! That's your name. Sir William Thatcher. Your father heard that. Godspeed, William. William! You have been weighed. You've been measured. And you absolutely... ...have been found wanting. Welcome to the new world. God save you, if it is right\Nthat he should do so. William! Yes! He's won! He's won! You beat him, Will! Oh, William. I'm going to write this story. About the prince and the knights? No, all of it. All human activity\Nlies within the artist's scope. Maybe not yours. Resync: Xenzai[NEF] Your round. Resync: Xenzai[NEF]
