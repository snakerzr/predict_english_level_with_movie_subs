Michael! Jane! What is it, Ellen? The bloody sink's exploded! - Dear.\N- Not again! Annabel! John! We heard, Aunt Jane!\NI'll ring the plumbers! I'll turn off the water\Nat the mains. Yes, thank you,\Ndarlings. Ellen, fetch us a mop and towels, will you? I told him\Nto get them pipes fixed. Been here\Nsince the Romans ruled. What's happening? Don't go\Nin the kitchen, Georgie. Not without your wellies. Yes. Hello.\NWe've had a burst pipe. <i>Just one moment, please.</i> Excuse me. Ellen! Can you please get the door?\NI've got the plumbers here. That was quick work,\Nwasn't it? - Here, Georgie. Take them.\N-17 Cherry Tree Lane. <i>By</i> the <i>park?</i> Yes, I'm coming! Blimey. Good morning, mum. They don't look\Nmuch like plumbers to me. I meant on the phone. We are not plumbers,\Nwe are lawyers. Lawyers? And here's me\Nhoping you might prove useful. Water's off! And the plumbers\Nare on their way. Well done, everybody.\NSuch excitement. What are you doing here,\NAunt Jane? We're handing out\Nbreakfast at the union hall. I snuck away\Nfor a morning hug. Come here, Georgie. Will you stop that banging? Barely eight o'clock\Non a Sunday morning! What you doing with my mop? Forgive the intrusion, mum. Our current workload prevents\Nus from taking weekends off. We would like to have a word with Mr. Banks,\Nif he is available. "Notice of Repossession"? Wait there. Goodness. I'll be cleaning up\Nthat mess all morning. Here, let me take that\Nfor you. Thank you, sweetheart. Excuse me, sir. The wolves are at the door. What do they want? Well, a good thrashing,\Nif you ask me. It's like\Nthe River Thames in there! Don't worry, Ellen.\NI'll clean up. Why don't you see\Nto the breakfast? Well, yes, somebody's got to,\Nhaven%they? Unless we all wanna starve. Why don't you let Ellen\Nclean up? I'm afraid, lately,\Nthat means more work for me. The other day,\NI found a butcher's sack hanging on the coat rack... - and my hat was in the larder.\N- Dear. Can we go to the park? No, Georgie. I need a brush!\NI look a fright. Michael, don't forget\Nyou've got guests at the door. Right. I'm sorry. We're struggling through a bit\Nof chaos this morning. - Please.\N- So it seems. Unfortunately, Mr. Banks,\Nour business cannot wait. - Excuse me, sir.\N- Today, we were... How exactly am I\Nsupposed to make breakfast when there's nothing\Nin the larder... but pickled herrings\Nand marmalade? The groceries.\NI meant to go yesterday. Very well.\NPickled herrings for breakfast and marmalade for lunch. There's a shop\Nacross the park, will be open. - The three of us can go.\N- Thank you, John. But you said we would go\Nto the park today! We can cut through the park\Non the way. But... Enough, Georgie, come along. I'll take that, Father. Thank you.\NPlease come through. Now, what is it\Nthat I can do for you? I am Hamilton Gooding.\NThis is Mr. Templeton Frye. We are solicitors with\Nthe law firm of Gordy, Cordry, - Gooding and Frye. What? No. Sorry, nothing. Uspruceur? Is that your garden club? No, it's the Society for\Nthe Protection of the Rights of the Underpaid Citizens\Nof England. A labor organizer. She's a labor organizer. Yes. Yes, but we also run\Nsoup kitchens. It's a never-ending job\Nthese days, I'm afraid. I'm sure it is, Mrs. Banks. Miss Banks, actually.\NI'm Michael's sister. My wife passed away\Nthis last year. That's awful.\NThose poor children. Yes. Our deepest condolences. Thank you. Forgive me, what brings the two of you\Nhere this morning? I'm going to say my goodbyes.\NI'm late for work. Mr. Banks, you took out a loan with the\NFidelity Fiduciary Bank... last year against the value\Nof your home. You did what? Michael. I had to, Jane. With Kate and the bills piling\Nup, I really had no choice. It's hard enough these days,\Nisn't it? Yes. Well... It seems you have fallen three months behind\Nin your payments. On. I'm so sorry. Kate, my wife, used to\Nlook after our finances. And I've been\Na bit off stride. Forgive me. How much is it\Nthat I owe you, exactly? Unfortunately,\Nthe bank is now demanding that you pay back\Nthe entire loan in full. The entire loan? Yes. It's all in the contract. That's more than I make in\Na year. I couldn't possibly. Dear. You have five days. If you are unable\Nto pay in full by Friday at midnight... I'm afraid we will have\Nto repossess your home... and you will have to vacate\Nthe premises. But I work\Nfor Fidelity Fiduciary. Not as an accountant,\NI presume. No, as a teller. I took a part-time position\Nthere this past year. You see, I'm really an artist. Yes, be that as it may. But my father, George Banks,\Nwas a senior partner there. Father left us shares\Nin the bank. You could use those\Nto pay off the loan. I was saving those\Nfor the children. Shares? In the bank? Well, that does change things,\Ndoesn't it? Primed and ready,\NMr. Binnacle? Ready and charged, sir. Do you have\Nthe share certificate? - I'm sorry, the what?\N- The document... The document proving\Nyou own shares in the bank. I suppose it must be somewhere\Namong Father's old papers. Yes, I suppose it must. Three... two... One! Fire! Good heavens! Are you housing anarchists? No, that's the Admiral,\Nnext door. He fires off a cannon\Nto mark the hour. He's over five minutes late. Yes. I'm afraid\Nhe's been running a little behind\Nthese last few years. As are we, this morning. You've been given notice. We'll see ourselves out.\NCome along, Mr. Frye. I do hope you find that share\Ncertificate. I really do. Good day to you both! You really have chosen the\Nwrong profession, you know. Why didn't you tell me\Nyou'd taken out a loan? I didn't want to worry you. Or the children. I kept thinking\NI would catch up. Kate always managed. Of all\Nthe thick-headed mistakes. I can't lose our home, Jane.\NShe's everywhere, here. Well, then, we're not\Ngoing to let that happen. But, Michael, you know we\Nneither of us have any money, so we just have to find\Nthat share certificate. Do you have any idea where\NFather might have kept it? I don't know. - In the attic, perhaps?\N- Yes. I'm sorry, I didn't mean\Nto bring you into all of this. Michael! Michael! This is our family home,\Nand you're about to lose it. So please stop pretending\Neverything's fine. You need... Are we going to lose our home? - No. No, no, no.\N- No, no. I... Aunt Jane was only... I was just saying\Nyou won't have to worry, because your father\Nowns shares in the bank. But you said we don't have\Nenough money. Well, I can make more money. I am a banker now, aren't I?\NThat's what bankers do. Make money. But you're not a banker.\NYou're a painter. Yes, well,\Npainters don't make money. Not these days. Here, you see. The day has hardly begun, and I have already made you\N10 pounds! We'd best be going. Yes, yes, let's get\Nyour hats on, shall we? One moment, John. Georgie shouldn't have to\Nspend his 10 pounds on the shopping, should he? Here you are. Thank you, Father. Off to the park, I see. - Yes, that's right, Ellen.\N- That's nice. Shall we search\Nthe attic, then? Don't you have to go to work? No. Work can wait. Thank you, Jane. Well, why don't I check\Nthe attic and you check Father's\Nold wardrobe? - Yes.\N- We'll make lunch... when we get home, Ellen. Gillie stays here. Blimey, what little\Ngrown-ups you've become. Father didn't give us\Nenough, did he? Not nearly. Well, we can ask for\Nday-old bread at half off. That's what Mother used to do. Hello, Willoughby! Hello, Miss Lark! Hello, Georgie. Twins. Good boy, Willoughby. Come on, Georgie, we haven't\Ngot enough time for this. - Aw.\N- Come along. Come on, Will. The balloon lady!\NCan we get balloons? No, Georgie! We haven't enough\Nfor groceries as it is. Oi! Georgie Banks!\NKeep off the grass. I don't spend all day\Ncaring for it just to see my work\Nget trampled on. Go on, off it! Sorry. What if Father\Ndoes lose the house? We'll just have to\Nfigure out a way to get it back, I suppose. You're right.\NThat's what Mother would do. No. <i>We haven't spoken\Nin so long, dear</i> <i>This year has gone by\Nin a blur</i> <i>Today, seems\Neverything's gone wrong here</i> <i>I'm looking\Nfor the way things were</i> <i>I know you'd laugh\Nand call me tragic</i> <i>For everything's\Nin disarray</i> <i>These rooms\Nwere always full of magic</i> <i>That's vanished...</i> <i>Since you went away</i> <i>This house is crowded now\Nwith questions</i> <i>Your John's\Na walking questionnaire</i> <i>And I could surely use\Na few suggestions</i> <i>On how to brush\Nour daughter's hair</i> <i>When Georgie\Nneeded explanations</i> <i>You always knew\Njust what to say</i> <i>And I miss\Nour family conversations</i> <i>It's silent...</i> <i>Since you went away</i> <i>Winter has gone</i> <i>But not from this room</i> <i>Snow's left the lane</i> <i>But the cherry trees\Nforgot to bloom</i> The certificate.

My goodness. Yes, it's quite a mess. Yes, it is. What are all your art things\Ndoing up here? I wasn't\Nusing them anymore. I should probably just\Nget rid of it all. Have you looked\Nin Father's old desk? I honestly\Ncan't remember why we kept most of this stuff\Nto begin with. I mean, why on earth did we\Nsave this old broken thing? Don't you remember that kite? We used to love flying that\Nwith Mother and Father. Well, it won't fly anymore. Out it goes. No looking back. <i>Hold on tight\Nto those you love</i> <i>And maybe soon\Nfrom up above</i> Willoughby! Naughty boy. Hush. How long do you think\Nit will take us today? Well, let's see. It's a\N9-minute walk to the shop. So if it takes 10 minutes... to purchase each item... Excuse me, children,\Ncoming through! Georgie! Come back! - Georgie!\N- You two! I've told you before,\Noff the grass! - But our brother!\N- You heard me! Now! What? Help! We're coming, Georgie! Help! Help! - Hold on!\N- Help me! As I live and breathe. You need to be more careful\Nwhen the wind rises, Georgie. You nearly lost your kite. And you two\Nnearly lost your Georgie. He might have\Ngot away completely had I not been holding on to the other end\Nof that string. My goodness, Annabel... what have you done\Nto your clothes? You could grow a garden\Nin that much soil. And, John... yes, just as filthy. How do you know our names? Because she's Mary Poppins,\Nof course. May I say, you look lovely,\Nas always. Do you really think so? Nice to see you, Jack. Good to see you too,\NMary Poppins. I was just your age\Nwhen we first met, working for a chimney sweep. How is dear old Bert? Traveling the world, he is.\NOff to points unknown. Well, now I am off to speak with the father\Nof these children. This family is clearly\Nin desperate need of a nanny. Now, quick march\Nand best foot forward, and I'll thank you\Nnot to dawdle. Go on! Father! Aunt Jane! Come quick! - Quickly!\N- What is it, Georgie? Has something happened? I was flying a kite\Nand it got caught on a nanny! Whatever are you\Ntalking about? Come! Come, look! Wait, where did you get\Nthat kite? I found it in the park. She kept it from blowing away. - Mary...\N- Poppins. Close your mouth please,\NMichael. We are still not a codfish. Jane Banks, still rather\Ninclined to giggle, I see. Good heavens,\Nit really is you. You seem hardly\Nto have aged at all. Really! How incredibly rude. One never discusses\Na woman's age, Michael. I would have hoped\NI taught you better. - I'm sorry, I didn't mean...\N- You came back. I thought\Nwe'd never see you again. It is wonderful to see you. Yes, it is, isn't it? So, you know her, then? Mary Poppins\Nused to be our nanny. What brings you here\Nafter all this time? Same thing that\Nbrought me the first time. I've come to look after\Nthe Banks children. - Us?\N- Yes, you too. But we don't need a nanny. Mother taught us\Nto look after ourselves. You did just misplace Georgie,\NI might point out. Only slightly.\NWe got him back. We can do anything\Na nanny can. Mary Poppins\Nflew here on a kite. You can't do that, can you? What are you talking about,\NGeorgie? Don't be silly. Let him believe\Nwhat he likes. When your father and I were\Nyoung, we used to imagine... that Mary Poppins could do all\Nsorts of impossible things. Actually... "Actually," what? Actually, I'd like to get back to the matter\Nof my employment. Your umbrella talks! Georgie, please, we're in the midst\Nof a grown-up conversation. Why don't we go\Nupstairs, Georgie? But it did talk! I promise! I'm afraid Georgie sometimes suffers from an excess\Nof imagination. As I recall, you had the same affliction\Nyourself when you were young. Did I, really? Well,\Nthose days are long behind me. Are they, indeed? - Now, about my employment...\N- Yes, about your employment... the truth is,\NI simply can't afford... We can settle on terms later, although I will want\Nmy old room back. That's if it's not\Na complete disaster... and I will insist on having\Nevery second Tuesday off. - No, I'm afraid, I...\N- Of course, Mary Poppins. Good, good.\NThat's all settled. Then I'll stay.\NNow, if you'll excuse me... the children have turned\Nthemselves into dustbins. So the first order of business is to see them properly bathed\Nand dressed. Jane, have you gone\Ncompletely mad? I can't afford to take\Non anyone else. Mary Poppins\Nisn't just anyone. Don't you see, Michael? No one's\Nhiring nannies anymore. The poor woman\Nhas nowhere to go. Well, neither will we\Nby the end of the week! Don't be so grumpy. - You sound just like Father.\N- I do not! Give Mary Poppins a chance. You need help\Njust as much as she does! Very well. She can stay\Nfor the time being, I suppose. After all, she did fly\Nall this way on a kite. Those things, when we were\Nyoung, they didn't really... - Happen?\N- No. - No.\N- Of course not. Ridiculous. Hello, Mary Poppins. Hello, Ellen. How'd you do that? Do what? And why didn't Father believe\Nyou flew here on a kite? Because it's\Ncomplete nonsense, of course. Grown-ups forget.\NThey always do. That will be\Nquite enough of that. I should have left you\Nin the umbrella stand. Not with the canes! What are you two\Nwhispering about? Nothing. "Nothing."\NSuch a useful word, isn't it? It can mean anything\Nand everything. AN ANNABEL It's just that... You don't require\Nthe services of a nanny. Well, we have grown up\Na good deal in the past year, after all. Yes. Well, we'll have to see\Nwhat can be done about that. That was\Nour mother's, be careful. I am always careful. So, you're staying? Yes, I'll stay.\NUntil the door opens. What does that mean? That door's always opening. Not that door,\Nanother one. The bathroom door? That's just silly, Georgie. - Not the bathroom door?\N- No. But a bath would prove useful. Come along.\NTime for a good, clean start. Mother always had us\Ntake our baths in the evening. Well, in my experience,\NAnnabel... the perfect time of day\Nto have a bath is when one needs a wash. Georgie, you will go first. We are perfectly capable\Nof drawing our own baths. How very helpful, John. In that case,\Nyou may turn off the tap. But not quite yet, still need\Nto put in the bubbles. But I don't like soap bubbles. Well, then\Nyou shall have to try to avoid them at all costs. She's a tough nut, isn't she? All right then... but we'll have to\Nget this done quickly! Right, we still have to\Nget down to the grocers... and it looks as though\Nit might rain. - I know who you should ask. Her umbrella can't talk,\NGeorgie. The very idea. How do you know it can't? Because it can't.\NThe very notion is ridiculous. Exactly right, Annabel.\NIt's nonsense. Foolishness. It makes no sense. And if it makes no sense,\Nit can't be true. <i>John, you're right</i> <i>It's good to know\Nyou're bright</i> <i>For intellect\Ncan wash away confusion</i> <i>Georgie sees,\Nand Annabel agrees</i> <i>Most folderol's\Nan optical illusion</i> <i>You three know it's true\Nthat one plus one is two</i> <i>Yes, logic is the rock\Nof our foundation</i> <i>I suspect,\Nand I'm never incorrect</i> <i>That you're far too old\Nto give in to imagination</i> No, not yet. <i>Some people like\Nto splash and play</i> <i>Can you imagine that?</i> <i>And take a seaside holiday</i> <i>Can you imagine that?</i> <i>Too much glee leaves\Nrings around the brain</i> <i>Take that joy\Nand send it down the drain</i> <i>Some people\Nlike to laugh at life</i> <i>And giggle through the day</i> <i>They think the world's\Na brand-new, shiny toy</i> <i>And if while dreaming\Nin the clouds</i> <i>They fall and go kersplat</i> <i>Although they're down\Nand bent in half</i> <i>They brush right off\Nand start to laugh!</i> <i>Can you imagine that?</i> On second thoughts,\Nperhaps you're right. It makes no sense to take\Na bath this early. Wait! I want to take a bath! Really? Very well, then. Up you go. And in you go. Georgie! Georgie! John! What happened?\NWill they be all right? Well, it is just a bath,\Nafter all. But then again,\Nit's not my tub. Shouldn't you go in\Nafter them? No, I had my bath\Nthis morning, thank you. Well, if you won't, I will! Off we go. <i>Some people like\Nto dive right in</i> <i>Can you imagine that?</i> <i>And ?ap about\Nin bathtub gin</i> <i>Can you imagine that?</i> <i>Doggies paddling\N20 leagues below</i> <i>Might seem real,\Nbut we know it's not so</i> <i>To cook without a recipe</i> <i>Can you imagine that?</i> <i>And heaven knows what lives\Nwithin that pot!</i> <i>Some pirates follow\Ntreasure maps</i> <i>And wear a silly hat</i> <i>They search the world\Nfor buried gold</i> <i>They won't grow up\Nand don't grow old!</i> <i>Can you imagine that?</i> Be sure to scrub\Nbehind your ears! <i>Some answer\Nwhen adventure calls!</i> <i>Can you imagine that?</i> <i>And sail straight\Nover waterfalls!</i> <i>Can you imagine that?</i> <i>They see living\Nas its own reward</i> Ahoy! <i>They rock the boat,\Nthen...</i> - Whoa!\N- Man overboard! <i>Some people\Nlook out on the sea</i> <i>And see a brand-new day</i> <i>Their spirit lifts them high\Nabove the blue</i> <i>Yet, some others\Nwear an anchor</i> <i>And they sink\Nin seconds flat</i> <i>So...</i> <i>Perhaps we've learn't\Nwhen day is done</i> <i>Some stuff and nonsense\Ncould be fun!</i> <i>Can you imagine that?</i> No. No. No. No. Anything? No, nothing. Just your old drawings,\Nand bills, and nothing else. Well, then that's it,\Nit's not here. Father, Aunt Jane! It was amazing! And\Nthen there were these boats! Everything you could\Never dream of! And then,\Nhe fell in the water! Not now, please. But it really happened!\NTell him, Mary Poppins! I have no idea\Nwhat you're all talking about. We swam through a pirate ship! Enough, please! You're right, Father.\NWe're sorry. No, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I don't mean to be cross\Nwith all of you. I... I've just lost something\Nvery important. Yes. And we're\Ngoing to find it. I'm sure your grandfather just tucked it away somewhere\Nfor safekeeping. The bank! Didn't Father have a safety\Ndeposit box in the bank? Yes. Yes, he did. - Well, let's go.\N-It's closed. We'll go first thing\Nin the morning. But won't we need a key? There's a whole drawer\Nfull of keys in Father's old desk upstairs. - ls there?\N- Yes! My goodness, gracious,\Nglory me. You'd think\Nby now they'd have learned to pick up after themselves. Cleaning is not a spectator\Nsport, I'll remind you. John, Annabel,\Nput all the books back on the bookshelves. Georgie Banks, come back here. Take out this rubbish,\Nwould you? Yes, Mary Poppins. There's a good boy. Off you go, spit spot- Well. That's that. What about Mr. Dawes, Jr.? Couldn't he give you\Nmore time? Yes, I'm sure he could\Nif he were still here... but Dawes' nephew has been\Nrunning things lately. I don't think he even knows\Nwho I am. - Thank you.\N- Very good, sir. Well, it's high time he found\Nout, don't you think? Jane? Jane! Jane! Jane! - Banks.\N- Good morning. Sorry. Jane. We can't just charge\Ninto his office. Hello, Miss Penny Farthing,\Nis it? Heavens, did the old secretary\Nfinally retire? She always had\Nthat big jar of sweets on the desk\Nwe'd raid as children. I remember that jar. Those little toffees that\Nstuck your teeth together. Must get you one of\Nthose jars, Miss Farthing. Of course, sir. This wouldn't happen to be your sister,\Nwould it, Mr. Banks? - Yes.\N- Yes, Jane Banks. How do you do? Great pleasure to meet you.\NWilliam Wetherall Wilkins. Do step this way. If I had known... that George Banks' son\Nhad taken a loan with us... I would have handled\Nthe paperwork myself. Unfortunately... regarding an extension, there's very little I can do\Nat this point. I see. Our father did leave us shares\Nin the bank. Well, that is good news! Yes. Yes, it is. But the trouble is, we can't seem to find\Nthe share certificate. You wouldn't happen\Nto have any record of Father's shares, would you? - I would think so. Bring in the shareholder's ledger, would you, Miss Farthing? <i>Right away, Mr. Wilkins.</i> And what about your uncle,\NMr. Dawes, Jr.? He'd know if Father received\Nshares, wouldn't he? I'm afraid dear old Uncle Dawes\Nis getting on in years. <i>Non compos mentis...</i> Which, sadly, is why\NI had to take over for him. Thank you, Miss Farthing. Let's see. "Babcock... "Baker..." Doesn't seem to be a listing\Nfor George Banks here. Don't despair. You still have until\Nthat big fellow out there chimes his last\Non Friday night... to find that certificate. And I'll keep looking here\Nas well. Yes, well, thank you\Nso very much, Mr. Wilkins. It's really been\Na great pleasure. Thank you. Very kind of you.\NThank you, Mr. Wilkins. Not at all. Bring in all of George Banks'\Nold files, would you? <i>Of course, Mr. Wilkins.</i> Georgie, this is a nursery, let me remind you,\Nand not a music hall. Can we have another bath? Pish posh. Now, John,\Nyou'd best go downstairs - and help Ellen... - Whoa!\N- ...put away the dishes. Yes, Mary Poppins. Here, I can\Nput those away myself. Very well, then. Now, Georgie Banks... if you were hoping\Nthat I will let you take this\Nsadly neglected kite... to the park tomorrow, you'd better start\Npatching it up this instant. Yes, Mary Poppins. Let me help you\Nwith those. You're a good lad. You're such a help, you are. I only wish\NI could help your father save this poor old house. I could sell my broach\Nand necklace, I suppose. Matching set,\Nmy old mum gave them to me. You'd do that for us? What?\NSell my prized possessions? No,\NI didn't mean it like that. It's all right.\NI think they're fakes, anyway. No. Plenty in this house worth\Nmore than them old trinkets. If you'll excuse me, Ellen. What's got into him? Annabel! - I know how to save the house!\N- What do you mean? If you two are going to keep\Nup all of this whispering... I'd like you\Nto practice doing so as loudly as possible. It will still be bad manners, but at least then we'll all\Nbe in on the secret. Hello, Jack! Mary Poppins,\Nhow are you this fine evening? I'm settling in\Nquite nicely, thank you. I was downstairs\Nwith Ellen... Do you know,\Nwhen I was a lad... I used to wave up to the boy\Nand girl who lived here. You mean Michael and Jane. Miss Jane Banks! I see Mr. Banks\Nabout now and again. It's been ages\Nsince I've seen her. Well, she lives in a flat\Non the other side of town now. I'm sure you'll bump into her\None of these days. What are you doing? You know we're not supposed\Nto touch that. This is authentic\NRoyal Doulton china, Annabel. Mother always said\Nit was priceless... and I bet it'll be enough\Nto pay off Father's debt. That's a terrible idea, John. You know\NMother loved that bowl. But she'd sell it herself\Nto save the house! That was Mother's!\NPut that back! No, Georgie,\Ngive it to me! - No! Put it back!\N- Let go, let go! It's a good thing\Nyou come along - when you did, Mary Poppins. That didn't sound good,\Nnow did it? What are the three of you\Nup to? - Give me the missing piece!\N- I don't have it! Well, look for it then! Which of you broke the bowl? - Georgie did.\N- I did not! It was Annabel! No, I didn't!\NIf John hadn't taken it... Actually,\Nit was all three of them. Who said that? Dear. Look!\NThe picture's changed. It looks\Nas though they've broken your carriage wheel. That they have.\NIt's useless now. Useless\Nas a chocolate teapot. The bowl is speaking! And who do we think\Nis gonna fix that? Aye, there's the riddle.\NThem what broke it fixes it. That's what I say. What do you think,\NMary Poppins? Well, I suppose\Nwe have no choice. But how are we\Ngoing to do that? I know a bit\Nabout fixing carriages. But we can't fix\Nthe carriage wheel. It isn't possible. Everything is possible.\NEven the impossible. Now, gather 'round,\Neveryone. Spit, spot! Georgie, don't forget Gillie. Are we ready? Ready. What just happened? Where are we? Looks like we're in china,\Nso to speak. Over here, everyone.\NThis wheel won't fix itself. Now, tread lightly,\Nthis is fine porcelain, and we don't want\Nto chip the glaze. Wheel. Georgie, head up\Nand feet beneath you. You too, John. Excuse me, driver,\Nwould you help us? Well, Mary Poppins,\Nis it yourself? - But he's...\N- But you're... - That's right, I'm Irish.\N- I'm also part poodle. How wonderful\Nto see you, Shamus. I'm so sorry about all this. Now, would you help Jack\Nlift the carriage while the children\Nput the wheel back on? With pleasure! She's talking to a dog! Well, of course she can talk. Take your places,\Neveryone. Ready? And lift. Yes. Let's see now,\Nthis should do it. There we are, shipshape. Not a bad job at all. Suppose it'll have to do. And back to the nursery we go. Back already? Can't we stay in this bowl\Nfor a while? I want a carriage ride. I wouldn't mind one myself. Well, I suppose\Nit wouldn't do any harm. Shamus, would you mind? Not in the least. Climb aboard, everybody! Hooray! Mind the step,\Nplant yourselves comfy. Now, where would we all like\Nto go on this fine, fine day? The Royal Doulton Music Hall,\Nplease. - Where?\N- What's that? We're on the brink\Nof an adventure, children, don't spoil it\Nwith too many questions. Let's go, Clyde!

He's mine!\NMy mother made him for me! Hey! Leave our brother alone! Time to go, boys! Annabel! Help! Georgie! We're coming, Georgie! John! Let me go! I want to go home! What home?\NYou've lost your home! Shamus! Clyde! That's right, it's us! Let's go\Nget your brother back. We're gaining on 'em! Give it more speed! Right away, sir. Giddy-up, big fella! We're closing in.\NGet ready to jump! Ready. And now! Well done, children! Give 'em what-for! Get rid of them! - But, sir!\N- You heard me! Georgie, are you all right? Annabel, look! - Stay with Georgie.\N- Right. Be careful! What are you doing? No! The edge of the bowl! Georgie, it's all right, it's all right. My goodness me. It's all right. You were having a nice\Nsort of nightmare, I must say. You were right, Mary Poppins!\NA cover is not the book. We thought they were nice,\Nbut they were mean! Whatever are you\Ntalking about? They tried to take Gillie! No, Gillie is right here,\Nsleeping, as you should be. But it was real!\NThey stole all our things... and the wolf said\Nwe were never going to see our home again! That is absurd. But I had a nightmare\Nlike that, too. So did I.\NIt seemed awfully real. I don't want to lose our home. You see, Georgie? That's why we wanted\NMother's bowl. We were going to sell it\Nto save the house. I miss Mother. Listen\Nto the three of you. You're all worrying\Nfar too much. After all, you can't lose\Nwhat you've never lost. I don't understand.

Mary Poppins' scarf. It wasn't a dream after all. Shall we tell her? Better not. I expect she already knows. Blast the devil, too soon! Why can't those pea-brained\NBig Ben buffoons get it right? Ahoy there, fair lady! Hello! Good morning. I'm sorry, miss. No, no. It's quite\Nall right. Don't worry. - Let me help you with that.\N- Thank you. Good morning, Jane. I see you've bumped into Jack. The children and I are\Nheading into town to get something fixed. Would you like to come\Nwith us? Work calls, I'm afraid.\NWe've got a rally today. That's right. You ought to\Ngive Jack one of those flyers. You're Miss Banks, aren't you? Yes. I don't know\Nif you remember me. I used to wave to you\Nwhen I'd see you up there in that very window. Yes. Jack. Yes, of course, I remember. Call me Jane, please. Of course,\NI was much younger then. True... but your smile\Nhasn't changed a bit. Well, it's this afternoon,\Nif you can make it. Spruce? Good for you, Jane Banks. All us lamplighters know what a fine job you're doing\Nfor the workers. Well, we try our best. If you ever need\Na ladder raised or a lamp lit,\Nconsider it done. Thank you, Jack. Thank you. Polishing the keyhole, are we? Look at this. Miss Jane's chatting with\Nthat handsome lamplighter. It looks like he's lit her up\Nas well, don't it? Ellen! No,\Nnothing will come of it. No, she says\Nthat ship's sailed. And I say,\Nthere are always other ships. My alarm didn't ring. Dear. Let me help you. I'm gonna be late. That's all that I need! Well, you're not late yet,\Nare you? Here you are. Off you go. Good morning, Michael. Hello, forgive me,\NI have to run. Watch where you're...\NMichael! I am so sorry! It's fine. Um, I'm looking for number 19. It's two doors down. Many thanks. Sincerely. Michael, your briefcase! Blimey, he'd leave his head on the breakfast table\Nif it weren't screwed on. Here, Ellen.\NI'll take the briefcase. The children and I are heading\Nthat way on an errand. We'll stop\Nby the bank afterwards. I'll give you a lift.\NMy rounds are done. Wonderful. All aboard, everyone. Come on. On the bicycle? But there are five of us.\NWe can't all fit. The weight\Non those wheels alone. Mary Poppins,\Nhow much do you weigh? Never you mind about that. It's all a question\Nof balance. - Annabel here.\N- Whoa! - And then John.\N- Whoa! Sit up straight!\NYou're not flour bags. - Georgie at the front.\N- Yay! - Mary Poppins, you here. - I've got it!\N- Blimey! All right, everybody. Primed and ready,\NMr. Binnacle? Ready and charged, sir. - Ready, everyone?\N- Ready! Are you sure\Nthis is quite safe? Not in the slightest.\NReady. Three! Two ! Steady;\N'One! - Fire!\N- Go! Now, pull over, right ahead.\NThank you, Jack. Right. Off we go, jiggity-jog. Thank you, Georgie. This way, please. Never noticed\Nthis alley before. Well, clearly you've never had a Royal Doulton bowl\Nthat wanted mending. Straight ahead. Here we are. "Topotrepolovsky's\Nall repairs, "large and small fix-it shop." Looks as though it's just\Na small fix-it shop today. That's just what we want. The bowl only needs\Na small fix, after all. So now my head\Nis a door knocker. I suppose my beak might be\Nuseful for opening cans. You fuss, fuss, fuss.\NDon't be so dramatic. Cousin Topsy! Mary Poppins! For the love\Nof all that is holy... do not come in! Don't be so rude! Please stay away. - It is Second Wednesday! Second Wednesday. Dear.\NI'd forgotten. Still, today or never,\Nthat's my motto. There we are! Follow me. So, in you come. You do not listen to Topsy. No! It has begun! Now, what do you want? You have guests, cousin. You might at least greet them\Nat the door. And how am I to do that,\Nplease, when I am down here,\Nup on the ceiling? Very well,\Nwe'll come to you. Excuse me, please, Georgie. Now, this way. Be careful on the way up. Why be careful? Leave it all for Topsy to fix. Climb on my shelves.\NStep on the toys. Kick the little china dolls\Nin their faces. John, Annabel,\NGeorgie and Jack... this is my cousin. Second cousin,\Nmany times removed. Tatiana Antanasia\NCositori Topotrepolovsky. But you may call me Topsy. That's an unusual accent\Nyou've got there. Where are you from? That's very\Ninteresting story... We have no idea. We need you\Nto fix this bowl, dear. No,no,no.\NIt is as I have told to you... second Wednesday\Nof the month... when everything\Nis turning turtle. - "Turning turtle"? What exactly does that mean? It means my whole world\Ngoes flippity-flop like a turtle on his back. And I don't know\Nmy up from my down, my east from my west. - My topsy from my bottomsy. Yes, I think\Nwe've all grasped the concept. Good. That's quick for you. You see, my littles,\Nanything I try to fix... on Second Wednesday\Ngoes kerflooey. Kerflooey. - Kerflooey! Please, cousin,\Nyou have always said that you can fix anything. Sweet girl,\Nyou tell Mary Poppins, who doesn't listen... that any other day, Tatiana Antanasia Cositori\NTopotrepolovsky... can fix anything. <i>If you ring\Nwith something broken</i> <i>On a Thursday</i> <i>I'll make new with my glue,\Npins and thread</i> <i>What you bring,\Nwhen I've awoken</i> <i>On a Friday</i> <i>I will mend, and then spend\Nthe day in bed</i> <i>Children, Saturn, Sun,\Nand Mondays</i> <i>Are just\Neverything-is-fun days</i> <i>But in the second week,\NI wear a frown</i> <i>For I know\Nthat after Tuesday</i> <i>Comes the\NTopsy-gets-bad-news day</i> <i>It's the dreaded\NSecond Wednesday</i> <i>When from nine to noon\Nmy life turns upside down</i> <i>Fast is slow, low is high\NStop is go and that is why</i> <i>Every Second Wednesday\Nis a hurdle</i> <i>From eight to nine\Nall is well</i> <i>Then I roll over\Non my shell</i> <i>And all because\Nthe world is turning turtle</i> <i>Now day is night, dog is cat\NBlack is white, thin is fat</i> <i>That is why\NI'm loosening up my girdle</i> <i>I cannot help\Nthis charming troupe</i> <i>Don't mock me\N'cause I'm in the soup</i> <i>And why?

But that doesn't make it\Nany less beautiful. Our mother always said\Nit was priceless. Well, I'm sure it was to her. Mary Poppins is right,\Nfor once. It is all in the way\Nthat you look at things. Thank you, cousin. Now, come along, children.\NGet your hats. And don't you worry\Nabout Mother's bowl. I will fix\Nand make perfect for you. So you come back, maybe,\Nnext Second Wednesday? Yes. Spit spot. Nice meeting you, Topsy Turvy. "Topsy Turvy' I like. It's catchy. Now, what do we do? I have no idea. Well, like Topsy said... maybe we should start\Nlooking at things differently. Marvellous. It looks like\Nthings are starting to turn around for my cousin. Mary Poppins, this is not\Nthe quickest way to the bank. It is today. Look, there's Aunt Jane! Aunt Jane! Aunt Jane! Hello! Off to the rally,\Nare you, Jane? Yes. All still here,\Nthank goodness. - Nobody fell off. Say, I could come back and\Ngive you a hand with all that once I drop the others\Nat the bank. No, please don't worry.\NI'm perfectly fine. Really. Nonsense. The bank's\Njust around the corner... and the children and I have plenty of legs\Nto get us there. Now, climb off, everyone.\NReady, and jump. Steady the bicycle for me,\Nwould you, children? You're sure\Nyou don't mind, Jack? 'Course not. I was hoping to drop by\Nthat rally of yours, anyway. You were? Good. You can ride\Nin the front basket. Really? I think she'll be better here. Here, is it? - Yeah. Up you go.\N- Now, where should I hold on? Handlebars are fine. - Ready?\N- Yes! Ready as I'll ever... My goodness! Now, be careful here, 'cause\Nthere are cars crossing! That's all right.\NThey'll see us. Right, that's enough. Step along, children. There must be\Nsomeone at this bank who could help us\Nsave our house. I'm sure\NFather's already asked. Well, we haven't. Maybe we could get them to see things\Nfrom a new point of view. Sit over there,\Nplease, children. Good afternoon. I'd like to see Mr. Michael... I'll need a signature\Nfor those, sir. Of course.\NExcuse me a moment. Well! We mustn't be late\Nfor Mr. Wilkins. What did you do that for? You hurt his feelings. You do know who those men are,\Ndon't you, Georgie? Yes. They're the lawyers. He's the nice one. Maybe we could convince him\Nto help us. Worth a try. Today or never,\Nthat's my motto. Come on! Now, how can I help you? Finally. I'd like to see\NMr. Michael Banks, please. Hello. Operator. - May we go in?\N- He's expecting you. Is there something I can do\Nfor you, children? May I have a sweet, please? Yes, of course you can, dear. -- You all can. ls in foreclosure. Mr. Michael Banks,\N17 Cherry Tree Lane. In foreclosure. How many repossessions,\Nso far, this month? 19, sir. And we have\Nnearly that amount scheduled for next week alone. Who'd have thought this slump would be so good\Nfor business? I wonder, Mr. Wilkins,\Nif, perhaps... as Michael Banks\Nis an employee, you might consider\Ngiving him a few more weeks. And lose our chance\Nto get that house? I mean... I don't like to lose,\NMr. Frye. <i>Didn't I ask\Nfor more tea, Miss Farthing?</i> Yes, sir. Right away,\NMr. Wilkins. Why don't you all\Nhelp yourselves? Come on. "Office of the Bank Chairman."\NWe can't go in there. I'm running\Na business, not a charity. It's just that, Well... his family has suffered tremendous hardship\Nthis past year... You are not giving\NBanks one more second... to pay off that loan. Do I make myself clear? Look. It's the wolf. In two days,\NBanks will be out on that street\Nand the house... will be ours. Georgie, no! You can't steal our house.\NI'm telling my father! Steal your...? Who are you? These are the Banks children. Are they? Come here, boy,\NI think you might have... - Let's go, Georgie!\N- Run! Close that door,\NMiss Farthing! Fool! Stop them. There you are,\NMichael. The children and I brought you\Nyour briefcase. Thank you. - You're welcome.\N- Where are the children? Father!\NFather! Father! - Help!\N- Wait! What is it?\NWhat's happened? He's the wolf\Ntrying to steal our house! What on earth\Nare you talking about? I'm afraid\Nyour children burst into my office\Njust now, Banks. What? I was just seeing if anything\Ncould be done about extending your loan... when they came in claiming I was trying\Nto steal your house. He is! We heard him! Mr. Wilkins\Nis trying to help us! But then,\Nwhy was he chasing us? I just thought they might\Nstop running around and making a scene\Nif I offered them some sweets. I'm so sorry, Mr. Wilkins. See it doesn't happen again. After all, you don't\Nwant your father... losing his position\Non account of you, do you? I know time is\Nrunning short, Banks... but I want you to have\Nevery chance of paying off that loan. So, I will make sure\Nthat I'm in my office on Friday evening... until the last stroke\Nof midnight. You have my word. Thank you, sir. Thank you. Gentlemen? But, Father,\Nhe really did do it. Not another word! - Take them home this instant!\N- Yes, sir. We'll discuss this\Nwhen I get back! Come along, children. Now we've done it,\Nhaven't we? I don't think\NI've ever seen Father that upset with us before. But we were\Ntelling the truth! That doesn't matter,\NGeorgie. We got him into trouble. And he doesn't even know\Nthat we broke Mother's bowl. Everything we've tried to fix,\Nwe've only made it worse. Which way do we go,\NMary Poppins? Now,\Nwhy would you ask me? The three of you are leading\Nthe way, after all. - Us?\N- But we were... Walking around in a fog. No, we weren't. I mean,\Nwe are in a fog, but... We were only talking. Yes, too focused\Non where you've been to pay attention\Nto where you're going. But Father told us\Nto go straight home! He'll be furious\Nif we're late. Not much to be done\Nabout that now, is there? Are we lost, then? That would depend\Non where you want to go. Jack! At your service. Say, what's with\Nall the glum faces? Lost sixpence\Nand found a penny? We've made a mess\Nof everything. Father's furious with us. And we can't find\Nour way home. Lost? Are you, Mary Poppins? Hopelessly. Well, now, I'm no expert... but if ever I lose my way, I just look for a little light\Nto guide me. <i>Let's say\Nyou're lost</i> <i>In a park, sure</i> <i>You can give in\Nto the dark, or</i> <i>You can trip a little light\Nfantastic with me</i> <i>When you're alone\Nin your room</i> <i>Your choice is just\Nembrace the gloom</i> <i>Or you can trip a little\Nlight fantastic with me</i> <i>For if you hide\Nunder the covers</i> <i>You might\Nnever see the day</i> <i>But if a spark can start\Ninside your heart</i> <i>Then you can always\Nfind the way</i> <i>So when life\Nis getting' dreary</i> <i>Just pretend\Nthat you're a leerie</i> <i>As you trip a little\Nlight fantastic with me</i> What's a leerie?

Leeries, trip the light\Nto lead the way! <i>Now, when you're stuck\Nin the mist, sure</i> <i>You can struggle\Nand resist, or</i> <i>You can trip a little\Nlight fantastic with me</i> <i>Now, say you're lost\Nin the crowd, well</i> <i>You can stamp\Nand scream out loud, or</i> <i>You can trip a little\Nlight fantastic with me</i> <i>And when the fog\Ncomes rolling' in</i> <i>Just keep your feet\Nupon the path</i> <i>Mustn't mope and frown\NOr worse, lie down</i> <i>Don't let it be\Nyour epitaph</i> <i>So, when life\Nis getting' scary</i> <i>Be your own illuminary</i> <i>Who can shine their light\Nfor all the world to see</i> <i>As you trip a little\Nlight fantastic with me</i> - Hello.\N- Hello.

Join us in a bit\Nof kick and prance. What did he say? "Kick and prance," it means\N"dance." It's leerie speak. You don't say\Nthe word you mean, you say something\Nthat rhymes, only... Here, I'll show you\Nhow it works. Angus, give us\Nyour weep and wail. To the rest of you,\Nthat means "tale." <i>I was short of a sheet</i> <i>He was in the street</i> <i>Just to tumble\Ndown the sink</i> <i>Just to get himself\Na drink</i> <i>Then I pinched\Nwhat's fatter</i> <i>He grabbed his ladder</i> <i>- To smile and smirk</i>\N<i>- To work!</i> There's nothing to it.

I told you to bring them\Nstraight home. I've been worried sick! We're sorry\Nwe're late, Father. It wasn't Mary Poppins' fault. We got lost in the fog. Jack and the leeries led us\Ndown the frog and toad. He means road. So you've been off filling\Nthe children's heads with stuff and nonsense. I've heard quite enough.\NCome in at once! Best to take my leave.\NGood night, Mary Poppins. Good night, Jack. Into the parlour, go on. Go on. Don't be too hard on 'em, sir. They're only children,\Nafter all. I know they're children,\Nmy children, and I will deal with them\Nas I see fit. - Now leave us to it.\N- Yes, sir. Not you, Mary Poppins.\NIn here. Very well, sir. You could have lost me my job. Do you understand that? Have you any idea\Nhow difficult it is to find a good position like mine\Nthese days? But there you all were,\Ntearing about like a... And you, Mary Poppins, I thought you were here\Nto look after these children. It wasn't her doing,\Nit was me. No, it was us. We thought maybe\Nif we talked to Mr. Frye... he could give you more time\Nto save the house. We were only trying to help. Well, you didn't help! Now... I know it's been a hard year\Nfor our family... and I've done all I can... to keep you all from worrying,\Nbut I can't do this on my own. It's too hard. I just... I'm barely holding it together\Nas it is. I can't even seem to remember\Nmy briefcase in the morning... and there's no more time, we're about to lose\Nour home... and I can't lose this house.\NI just can't. I don't know what to do. I'm sorry,\NI don't know what to do. Everything's fallen to pieces\Nsince your mother... Haven't we lost\Nenough already? We haven't lost Mother. Not really. <i>Nothing is gone\Nforever, only out of place</i> <i>So when we need her touch\Nand loving gaze</i> <i>"Gone but not forgotten"\Nis the perfect phrase</i> <i>Smiling from a star\Nthat she makes glow</i> <i>Trust she's always there</i> <i>Watching as we grow</i> <i>Find her in the place</i> <i>Where the lost things go</i> When did you all\Nget so clever? Last night,\NMary Poppins told us... I hope I'm as clever as you\Nwhen I grow up. You're right. Of course, you're right,\NGeorgie. Your mother's not gone.\NShe's in your smile. And in your walk, John... and Annabel's eyes. And she'll always be with us\Nwherever we go. Love you. Now, run along, wash your\Nhands, get ready for dinner. Did you have something\Nto do with them trying to save the house? I never said a word. It was\Nall the children's idea. The whole time\NI've been looking after them, they've been looking after me. I had it all backward. A Banks family trait. What was I thinking? Some people think\Na great deal too much. Of that I'm certain. Here, Jane.\NLet me help you with that. Thank you. No luck? We can look through\Neverything again if you like. No. No, there's no point.\NIt's nearly midnight. We tried our best, but\Nthank you, Jack, so much... and thanks to all your friends\Nfor helping us. Thank you. Of course. Anything for you. We'll be out in a moment. The children\Nhave packed up the last of their things\Nthemselves. Well done, everyone. All right,\Nhave you got Gillie? Yes, Father. Good, good. Good riddance\Nto that old kitchen. Never could figure out\Nthat stove. All right, Well... we've spent every last moment\Nthat we can here. It's time to say goodbye. Goodbye, old friend! Goodbye, old friend! - <i>Thank you.</i>\N- <i>Thank you.</i> - Hello, Willoughby.\N- Miss Lark. Admiral. What are you all\Ndoing here so late? We've been waiting'\Nto see you off, sir. We'd be here no matter\Nwhat the hour. If you or your family should ever need\Na place to stay... Willoughby and I would be\Nhappy for the company. That's very kind of you,\NMiss Lark. Jane's offered to put us up\Nin her flat... at least for the time being. No, forever,\Nfor as long as you'd like. I wish you'd come\Nwith us, Ellen. Don't you worry about me. I got a nice room fixed up\Nat my sister's. You won't leave us,\Nwill you, Mary Poppins? Don't be silly. She says she's not leaving\Nuntil the door opens. In any case,\Nyour home is with us. I'm pleased she got caught\Non your string, Georgie. My kite! I forgot my kite! Very well,\Nbut be quick about it. The Admiral's got something he would like to give you,\NMr. Banks, sir. <i>The H. M.</i> S. <i>Glad Tidings,</i>\NI <i>commanded her myself.</i> May she guide you\Nsafely into port. Thank you very much, Admiral. I will take\Nvery good care of her. Eight bells, Mr. Binnacle,\Ntime to man our posts! Yes, sir.\NGoodbye, Mr. Banks, sir. - Bye. Bye.\N- Goodbye, Binnacle. - I found it!\N- Bye, Miss Lark. Bye, Willoughby. I'm not sure that's gonna\Nget off the ground anymore. It looks more glue than kite. Georgie... did you patch this up\Nwith one of my old drawings? It looks like you've done\Na fine job, there. Look. Can you see? That's all of us together... in front of the... - What is it, Father?\N- Wait. "Certificate of shares"! This is it. This is what\Nwe've been looking for! Yes! Yes! We need\Nto get to the bank! What's the time? Anyone? Um, seven minutes to midnight. Seven minutes?\NIt's not enough time. We need to be at the bank\Nby midnight. - Take the van.\N- No, it's no good. You still wouldn't\Nmake it in time. Well, what can we do? Nothing.\NWe can't turn back time. Why not? Everything is possible. Even the impossible. Can we do that,\NMary Poppins? Can we turn back time? Well, I don't see why\Nthat couldn't be arranged. -- But that's ridiculous. Indeed it is, Michael.\NIt's nonsense. Foolishness! It makes no sense!\NAnd if it makes no sense... it can't be true! What are you\Nall talking about? Never you mind about that. You just get that kite\Nto the bank... as fast as possible,\Nand leave the rest to us. - How will you...\N- Go! Now, we'll need\Na lot of help, Jack. Good as done! - Go and gather the leeries!\N- Right. Children, help me\Nready the bicycle. I'll take the reins this time.\NSpeed is of the essence. Have you ever ridden\Na bicycle like this before? Please. How different can\Nit be from riding an elephant? - Ready, and up! Now, all we have to do\Nis turn back time. This is fun! A very good week's work,\Ngentlemen. Thank you, sir. It look as if Banks won't be\Njoining us tonight. He does have\Na few more minutes, sir. You said you'd wait until\Nthe last stroke of midnight. Yes, I know that! So we wait. I'm a man of my word. How much time do we have? Um, there's only\Nfive minutes left, I think. Good. Now over\Nto the tower, boys! Sorry, this is as far\Nas you go. Back in a flash. - Come on!\N- Come on, lads! Ladder Jack! - Ladder!\N- Ladder! - Ladder!\N- Ladder! No, I can't watch! I mean, you would think\Nthey'd never done this before. What are we gonna do? I've got an idea! Come on! Now! Yay! Jack! You can turn\Nthe time back now! How? I can't reach the hands! Honestly. They better hurry. We have less than\Na minute to go. We're too late, Jack! There's got to be a way! Look! And three,\Ntwo, one... Why hasn't Big Ben chimed? Perhaps your watch\Nis running fast. Don't be a simpleton,\Nmy watch never runs fast. Big Ben's gone dark. Relight the clock,\NJack, quickly. Look. They've relit Big Ben. But that time is wrong. The clock must have stopped. That's Banks. He's made it in time! Not yet he hasn't. Get down\Nthere and make sure... he doesn't get inside until\Nthat blasted clock strikes 12. - But, sir...\N- Now, Mr. Frye! Lock it, Mr. Frye! Hello! Hello!\NLet us in, please! Please, let us in! JANE; Hello? Hello? - Jane.\N- What? Let's... Let's go fly a kite. There it is!\NIt's the one with the light. The first one? Okay. You run. I'll unspool. Yes, quickly! Come on! Come on! Hello! It won't work.\NHe's never gonna see it. - Let's get in.\N- Yes, let's go! - Let us in, please! Please let us in!\NWe need to get inside! - Thank you!\N- Thank you! Hurry, Mr. Banks! What? What is all this? It's what\Nwe've been looking for. Three, two, one... fire! Mr. Binnacle... Big Ben has\Nfinally got it right. <i>And this goes...</i> at the top. What's that?\NWhere did this go? - Right there?\N- No. - No, there.\N- This piece goes there. And does it matter that\Nit's all cut up in bits? It's still worth something,\Nis it? It's still valid, so long as\Nall the pieces are there. Is that so? Now, Georgie, there was one\Nmore piece, a corner piece... with a lot of signatures\Non it. Do you remember that? I must have thrown it out.\NI'm sorry, Father. that's all right, Georgie. No, it isn't. I'm afraid you have\Na problem, Banks. You see,\Nwithout those signatures, you have no bank shares... no house... you have nothing. What? But he knows you have\Nthe bank shares! He's been planning this\Nall along! Take your children\Nout of here, Banks. I've had enough of their lies. Don't you dare\Ninsult my children. - Don't you dare. They are not lying,\Nand you know it! I only wish I'd believed\Nthem sooner! You all had him pegged right\Nfrom the start, didn't you? Come on. Take the house! Go ahead. I have everything\NI need right here. He has you there, Willie. Uncle Dawes? What on earth\Nare you doing here? A little bird told me... that you've been trying\Nto cheat the Banks family... out of their shares\Nin this bank. That he has. We heard him. I also hear... you've been telling\Nthe whole of London that I've gone loony. The only loony thing\NI ever did was trust you\Nto look after this bank! You can't be serious, I've nearly doubled\Nthe profits of this bank. Yes, by wringing it out of\Nthe customers' pockets. Their trust in us\Nbuilt this bank. You've squandered every\Nlast bit of their goodwill. Well, Willie... I'm back, and you're out. Gentlemen, would you show\Nmy nephew to the door, please? Yes, sir, Mr. Dawes. Get off! You're not fit\Nto run this bank! We'll see about that! I may be circling the drain... but I got a few steps\Nleft in me. <i>So, when they\Ntell you that you're finished</i> <i>And your chance\Nto dance is done</i> <i>That's the time to stand\NTo strike up the band</i> <i>And tell 'em that\Nyou've just begun</i> <i>So when life's\Na real pea-souper</i> <i>You must choose\Nto be a trouper</i> <i>For your light comes\Nwith a lifetime guarantee</i> <i>As you</i> <i>With me!</i> <i>Went to the bank,\Nrattle and clank</i> <i>Met with the boss\NPitch and toss</i> <i>Got lost in the fog\NLump on a log</i> <i>- Trip a little\N-Trip a little</i> <i>Trip a little light fantastic!</i> <i>Light fantastic!</i> John, would you get\Nthe feet off the... - Yeah.\N- Thank you. So glad to have you back,\NMr. Dawes. Thank you, Michael. By the way,\Nthose shares of yours... perfectly fine... save 'em for your family. I'm sorry, I don't understand. I'd like to tell you\Na little story. Once upon a time... there was a man\Nwith a wooden leg... That's not it. It's about a little boy\Nnamed Michael. Michael wanted to give his\Ntuppence to a bird lady... but after\Na little persuasion? He decided he'd give 'em\Nto his father. Michael's father,\Nyour grandfather... gave those tuppence\Nto this bank... and told us to guard it well. We did just that. And after several quite\Nclever investments... if I do say so myself... that tuppence has grown\Ninto quite a tidy sum. Really? Really, Michael. In fact, enough\Nto pay off that loan you took. - The house is yours. What a beautiful day\Nto be going back home. Look at them\Nlovely cherry blossoms. They're lovely. I shall have to paint them. What about you, Jane? What about me? He means what about you and that handsome\Nlamplighter, Jack? No! No, we're just friends. - Go on.\N- Really. Stop it, Ellen! What's this? The Spring Fair, it's today!\NCan we go? Please? I don't see why not. Hooray! Come on, Father, let's go! Will you go\Non the Ferris wheel with us? Yes.\NAnd you too, Jane! Only if you come\Nwith me, Ellen. What? Wouldn't be\Ncaught dead on that thing. Follow me! Follow me! All right, all right.\NMy turn, my turn. - Let's see it.\N- I've got it. Come ride\Nthe Ferris wheel! Come ride the Ferris wheel! - Georgie!\N- Georgie! - Slow down!\N- Race you! Lollipops! Look at\Nthe Ferris wheel! The ponies! <i>Life's</i> a <i>balloon\Nthat tumbles or rises</i> <i>Depending on what is inside</i> <i>Fill it with hope\Nand playful surprises</i> <i>And, dearie ducks,\Nthen you're in for a ride</i> <i>Look inside the balloon</i> <i>And if you hear a tune</i> <i>There's nowhere to go but up</i> May we have balloons?
