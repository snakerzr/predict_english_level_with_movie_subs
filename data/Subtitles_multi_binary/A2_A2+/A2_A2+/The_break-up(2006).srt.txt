I'm going.\NDo you think\Nyou'll marry him? What?\N'Cause I know\Nyou've thought about it. The first time\Nyou laid eyes on him,\Nyou probably thought, "I wonder if I could marry\Nthis guy in plaid shorts who\Ntucks his shirt in. No way." Then when you kissed him,\Nyou said, "I can't believe it. "I had a lot to drink\Ntonight. I'm kissing\Nthe tucked-in guy." My point is, if you're\Nnot gonna marry him...\NYeah. ...and if it's not forever, then you really don't have\Nanything to lose in\Ntaking me up on my offer. Uh-huh. Well, I'm gonna go.\NOkay. Me, too. Okay.\NTo where? On an\Nice-breaking first date? Well, no, I don't think...\NListen.

But for all you know,\NI just offered you a get-out-of-bored-Iove-\Nfor-free card\Nwith no strings attached. God, you're crazy.\NNo, I'm not crazy. And a lot of times people go,\N"Oh, that's crazy," and then they go,\N"It's genius." That's what happened\Nwhen the person invented fire. They burned that witch.\NAnd guess what, then they got\Nwarm and they ate good stuff. Now, where are we headed to?\NLet's not make this weird, 'cause I'm not good on dates.\NNo. You know what? I'm better just to kind of\Nhang out and,\Nif we don't have fun, I might go my separate way.\NOkay. I'm not committing\Nto anything. I'll go hang out\Nwith you for a little bit.

The artist was inspired\Nby the neoclassical movement. CHRISTOPHER: No, she doesn't. But wanted to reflect it\Nwith an abstract bent. CHRISTOPHER: Okay, bye-bye. And how much is it?\N$35,000. Happy Holidays.\NMarilyn Dean Gallery.\NHold, please. Will you excuse me\Nfor a moment?\NSure. Go ahead. Christopher?\NYes, sweetie. Hi, honey.\NHi. Christmas was months ago.\NDon't remind me.\NI miss it so much. Yeah, I know.\NBut today is not a holiday. I know for a fact\Nthat people like\Nmy spirit on the phone and they dig the energy\Nthat I give them. Okay. I'm just saying,\NI don't think Marilyn Dean\Nwill "dig" the energy. Oh, no.\NShe's the one that told me\Nto be creative. So... I know. It's just... Okay.\NWhat is the next holiday\Ncoming? The Fourth of July,\Nis that what's next? Well, if you want\Nto get technical,\Nthere's Memorial Day, there's Flag Day. Some people recognize\NFather's Day as a holiday.\NI don't. I get it. I get it.\NWell, on those days\Nyou can say, "Happy Holidays." Every other day,\N"Good morning, good afternoon, "good evening,\NMarilyn Dean Gallery."\NOkay? Okay. I'm so sorry about that.\NOh, no. So, now this is a new piece\Nby Zakrzewska. What do you think of this? Can I be honest with you?\NPlease. Other than taking\Nan art history class\Nin college, which I pretty much\Nslept through, I don't have\Nthe first clue about art or how to go about buying it.\NI mean, like that painting. I mean, I don't see the point\Nin buying something that\NI could have done myself. Yeah. I completely agree\Nwith you. You know, an art teacher\Nof mine once said, "Never buy a piece of art\Nthat you don't have to have." You know, don't worry\Nabout who the artist is\Nor how much it's worth. I mean, you have to live\Nwith it every day. You have\Nto walk by it every day. You know, you have to\Nreally love it. You have\Nto really appreciate it. It's kind of like\Npicking a mate. (EXCLAIMING) GARY: Hey, honey!\NHi. How's it going?\NBROOKE: It's good. Oh, wow. You got\Na lot happening.\NI know. Very exciting.\NI am starving. Oh, careful.

Really?\NYou got three lemons. What my baby wants,\Nmy baby gets. You know that. Yeah, but I wanted 12.\NBaby wanted 12. Why would you want 12 lemons? Because I'm making\Na 12-lemon centerpiece. So, no one's actually\Neven eating them?\NThey're just show lemons? Yeah. They're just\Nshow lemons. Shown in\Nthe center of the table. I'm glad you find that\Namusing, but I cannot fill a vase\Nwith only three lemons. Well,\Ncan't you just use, like,\Nmaybe a drinking glass? I'm not gonna use\Na drinking... We could have\Na smaller version\Nof a centerpiece. I'm not gonna use\Na drinking glass\Nfor our centerpiece. You know what?\NI've got an idea. Why don't we go ahead and\Nscratch the centerpiece idea\Naltogether, because the chicken\Nthat burnt my mouth could maybe use\Na little bit of lemon\Non top of it. Guess what? Now we've made\Na better meal versus something\Nvisually nice to look at. What are you do...\NWhat's happening here?\NWhat are you doing? What are you doing?\N(STAMMERING) Oh, I had\Nsuch a long day on the bus. I need a little bit\Nof down time.\NMy feet are killing me. Gary, come on,\Nmy feet are killing me, too.\NI'm exhausted. I worked all day.\NWent to the market. I cleaned this entire condo\Nand then I've been cooking\Nfor the last three hours. Come on. Help set the table. GARY: Sweetheart.\NWhat? You've done such a great job\Nalready. Don't you want\Nto finish it yourself and have that personal power\Nof that accomplishment? Set the table.\NListen to me. Do you think that\Nwhen Michelangelo, right, was painting\Nthe Sixteenth Chapel,\Nthat he said, "Hey, guys, you know,\NI did pretty good\Non the first 15 chapels, "but why don't you help me\Ndesign this one? "And maybe\Nyou could help me...\NGive me a brush "and you guys can\Ngrab brushes, and we can all\Nmake a great chapel." Uh-uh. No, he didn't.\NAnd you wanna know\Nwhat the results were? A masterpiece. Okay. It's the Sistine Chapel,\Nnot the Sixteenth, and I bet when Michelangelo\Nasked for 12 brushes,\Nthey didn't bring him three. Yeah. Okay, all the talking\Nis really starting\Nto drain me, and now I'm gonna have to\Nwatch the highlights later\Nto see what I missed here. Honey, look, Gary, just...\NDown time's important. Gary, please just\Ntake a shower, okay?\NDown time's important. 'Cause this is what\NI don't want to have happen. I don't want the doorbell\Nto ring. I'm then forced\Nto answer the door, entertain people,\Nand I'm still cooking dinner. Yeah.\NOkay? You're absolutely right.\NLet's do that. The second\Nthat this inning's over... Gary.\NThere's one out all ready. They're gonna be here\Nin 20 minutes. Baby, have you ever seen\Na shower of mine take\Nmore than four minutes? Yes, I have. Come on. (DOORBELL RINGING)\NOh, great! They're here. Okay.\NTable's not set.\NDinner's not ready. Would you please\Njust let my parents in? I gotta jump in the shower.\NWhat? (DOORBELL RINGING)\NI gotta go. Gary. Gary. (DOORBELL RINGING) GARY: Well, seeing how\Nour families haven't\Nhad many opportunities to get to know one another,\Nwe figured, what better way\Nthan to break some bread? So, everyone,\Nthank you for coming\Nand enjoy the meal. ALL: Cheers.\NCheers, honey. Mrs. Grobowski.\NNice to meet you.\NThank you. DENNIS: Cheer with the sons.\NGARY: Sweetheart,\Ncheers to you. Darling, I see that you put\Nthose Feng Shui books that I sent to you\Nto good use. This place is\Nso well balanced.\NThanks, Mom. Yeah, the energy in this place\Nis just amazing. WENDY: Yes. Well, the energy in the condo\Nmight be a little more amazing if we had a pool table. Gary, we've already\Ndiscussed that. We're gonna get a pool table\Nwhen we get a bigger place. The place is plenty big now,\Nif you wanted a pool table\Nbecause... Gary.\NYeah. You could take\Nthe dining room table, go ahead and move her\Nin the living room. BROOKE: Really?\NGARY: Plenty of room. And put a dining room table\Nin the living room? Okay. How do you...\NI mean, what do you do\Nwith a dining room table? Eat on it.\NWe'd have no furniture\Nin the living... Where's the furniture go?\NAll I'm saying is, it would be nice\Nto be able to shoot some pool. Well, this isn't a dorm.\NLook, baby,\NI completely understand. There's halls and stuff.\NI mean, you can go... We will wait\Nand get a pool table\Nwhen we have a bigger place. Thank you. The food is outstanding.\NIt is delicious food. DENNIS: It's outstanding. LUPUS:\NYeah, it really is nice.\NOkay, everybody. Time for the joke of the day.\NKnock, knock.\NDad. Dad, come on. Who's there?\NNorma Lee. Norma Lee, who? Normally, I don't go around\Nknocking on doors, but would you like to buy\Nan encyclopedia?\NLUPUS: I got a joke.\NI got a joke. (ALL CHUCKLING)\NHow's it going?\NI got a joke for you. What do you get when you cross\Na gay Eskimo and a black guy? All right, look,\NI think we've had enough\Nwith the jokes for tonight. Thank you, though.\NLet's just talk\Nwith each other. All right. I saw that Three Brothers\Narticle in the <i>Trib</i> this week. Sounds like you guys are up\Nto some pretty exciting stuff. Basically, our big goal is to\Ntry to take Chicago tourism\Nby air, land and sea. We're still in the ground\Nphase with the buses. But as soon as we get\Nour infantry established, then we'll take it\Nto the squids.\NYeah. Boats. Boats.\NOh, boats. As soon as we control\Nthe waterway, then we'll\Nbring in air supports and then we'll pretty much\Ncontrol everything. You know, Dennis, the way your face lights up\Nwhen you describe\Nyour ambitions, it's really inspiring. Oh, thanks.\NBecause I understand how you feel that passion. RICHARD: And sharing it\Nwith other people, I think\Nthat's what life's about. I don't feel that about\Nboats and squibs... Squids? ALL: Squids.\NSorry. CAROL: Yeah.\NBut I do feel it\Nabout singing. With my <i>a cappella</i> group,\NThe Tone Rangers. Although it's not\Nas aggressive as your dream, it's really\Nmore of a brotherhood.\NIt's like a musical team. It's like a symphony of guys.\NGuy symphony. And it's very hard\Nto describe the true magic of a group of guys\Nsinging in perfect harmony. It's transcendent. But it's still very real. I guess the best way\Nto put it in words is just... (SINGING SINGLE NOTE) Even that doesn't do it. That doesn't do it\Nbecause that's just\None person. And what I'm talking about is\Nthe pulse of the collective. Oh, heck. Let me just\Nshow you how it's done. Dad, how about\Na little percussion? RICHARD: Tap-tap-tappy.\NTap-tap-tappy. And, Mom, high-hat. (HISSING) RICHARD: Good, Mom.\NExcellent. And Gary! (RHYTHMICALLY)\NOn the kick drum! Come, come!\NOn the kick drum! Come, come! That's Gary! Come, come\Nwith the kick drum. Come!

Come, come.\NWith the kick drum.\NCome, come. I'm just not really\Nthe kick drum kind of guy. I'd rather be just a listener\Nand enjoy all the banging\Nthat he's doing and the... You know, Gary,\Nthat's your prerogative.\NThat's your right, to listen. Meantime, I've gotta talk\Nto Brooke about something. It's called the bass line.\NExcuse me.\NOkay.

I'll help you\Ndo the damn dishes.\NOh, come on. You know what? No. See?\NThat's not what I want. You just said that you want me\Nto help you do the dishes. I want you to want\Nto do the dishes.\NWhy would I want to do dishes? Why?\NSee, that's my whole point. Let me see if I'm\Nfollowing this, okay? Are you\Ntelling me that you're upset because I don't have\Na strong desire\Nto clean dishes? No. I'm upset because\Nyou don't have a strong desire\Nto offer to do the dishes.

I said you're acting crazy.\NYou know what, Gary? I asked you to do\None thing today,\None very simple thing, to bring me 12 lemons\Nand you brought me three. God damn it. If I knew\Nthat it was gonna be\Nthis much trouble, I would have brought home\N24 lemons. Even 100 lemons.

Well, I do seem to remember\Ndoing something for you\Nthis morning without you asking. Gary, come on.\NWhat? I'm serious. Come here. You know what? I'm serious.\NI really am.\NI am, too. Come on.\NYou knew I was working today\Nand I made that meal. And you could have thought\Nto yourself, you know,\Nyou could have said, "Yeah, I think I'm gonna\Nget Brooke some flowers." You said\Non our very first date\Nthat you don't like flowers, that they're a waste of money. Every girl likes flowers,\NGary. You said that you\Ndon't like flowers.

I sit there in a sweat.\NThe whole thing, I do, wondering when the hell's\Nthe goddamn nightmare\Ngonna end. Go to a damn ballet.\NIt's not about you\Nloving the ballet, Gary.

We don't go anywhere together. We just went\Nto Ann Arbor together.\NTo Ann Arbor. To the\NMichigan-Notre Dame game. You think screaming,\Ndrunk kids and leprechauns\Ndoing backflips, that's fun.

You...\NI'm busting my ass to be the best tour guide\Nin the damn city, so I can make enough money\Nto support both of us and hopefully you won't\Nhave to work one day. I want to work.\NAll I ask, Brooke, is that you show a little bit\Nof appreciation. That I just get 20 minutes\Nto relax when I come home, instead of being attacked\Nwith questions and nagged\Nthe whole damn time. You think that I nag you?\NThat's all you do! All you do is nag me! "The bathroom's a mess."\N"Your belt doesn't match." "Hey, Gary, you should\Nprobably go work out." Nothing I ever do\Nis ever good enough! I just want to be left\Nthe hell alone! Really?

You leave your socks\Nall over this house,\Ndress like a pig, play your stupid-ass\Nvideo game.\NI don't care, I'm done. What?\NI'm done!\NI don't deserve this.

No, sweetie,\Nyou did have a choice, okay? And it sounds like you\Nmade the right one.\NYou respected yourself. But it's just not what I want.\NI don't want to break up\Nwith him. I don't. I just want him\Nto say thank you. I want him\Nto want to do the dishes. I just want him to want\Nto take me to the ballet. I want him to get me\N12 lemons! You know... I just want him to care\Nenough about this relationship\Nto want to work on it. Okay, you know what?\NI'm putting on my shoes and I'm gonna be there\Nin 15 minutes.\NNo, Ad. Don't. Please, I really don't\Nwant to see anybody.\NI really don't. But, look, I'm worried\Nabout you, okay? And I can hear you in there\Nbanging around your dishes. And I don't want you\Ngetting out your Clorox\Nand your rubber gloves, and taking this out\Non the kitchen.\NLook, look, look. Okay. Tonight just...\NIt just got a little\Nout of hand, and hopefully\Nhe's just gonna realize that he's got some changes\Nto make and he's gonna... He's gonna come home\Nand apologize. Okay?\NThat's what's gonna happen. GARY: I feel like, I don't...\NYou know, like, you dress\Nhowever you want to dress. You know,\Ndo whatever you want to do. I'm done with\Nthe relationship.\NWhatever. So, it's just kind of,\N"You're done\Nwith the relationship?" Well, you're obviously\Nhurt about it. She got to you. You're hurt.\NI'm not. It's nothing to be ashamed of.\NShe hurt you. Will you look at me?\NI'm not heartbroken. I'm a little shocked.\NI'm a little surprised. Gary, you're devastated.\NNow, what's the name\Nof the guy she's doing? I'm gonna solve your problem.\NWhat's his name? What are you talking about?\NHave you checked her e-mail? I don't check e-mails.\NI don't... You can get a program\Nthat records keystrokes. It costs, like, 20 bucks.\NVery easy to use. Okay? You get a password, you check\Nher e-mail. You find out\Neverything about her. That's how I found out\Nabout the Puerto Rican that Stacy was\Nrunning around with.\NOkay. You are reading\Na little too much\Ninto this situation. There is no one she's\Nrunning around with, okay? We had a fight\Nover the groceries\NI brought home. You're probably right.\NShe's probably not\Nsleeping with anybody. No. Not what it's about.\NOkay. Maybe she's with\Nanother guy, maybe not.\NShe's not. I don't know.\NI'm not Columbo. Okay? But what we do know\Nis that she doesn't want\Nto be with you anymore. I mean, I hate to be shitty\Nabout it, and so cut and dry,\Nbut let's face it. She says she doesn't\Nwant to be with you,\Nand I believe her. Now, we gotta figure it out.\NAnd you're gonna\Nneed a place to go and lick your wounds\Nwhile you get your head\Nright over this thing. I don't need a place to go\Nand lick my wounds. You're gonna stay with me. I'm not gonna hear it.\NLook it... I'm not moving\Nout of the place.\NOh, you're not moving out. No. I put money in the place.\NI put half my money\Nin the place. You're obviously not\Nthe one calling the shots\Nin this case. Yeah, but I own the place. With her.\NYeah. But it's not up to her\Nwho gets to keep\Nthe goddamn place. If you find out\Nwho she's sleeping with,\Nmaybe we could leverage it. I want you to listen to me.\NYou listen to me. I'm gonna leave you a key.\NI don't need a key. Why?\N'Cause she's gonna put... She's gonna move out\Nof the place, Johnny. Did she say\Nshe was moving out?\NShe will.\NShe's gonna move out. Oh, she's...\NI'm gonna keep the place. I'm not moving\Nout of the place. I'll leave you a key. (DOOR OPENING) (DOOR SHUTTING) (TOOL WHIRRING) Hey, how's it going?\NLUPUS: I almost got it. Yeah.\NYou know, I was thinking. You know what you should do, is you should find somebody\Nwho looks like Brooke, but even hotter and, you know,\Nbang the shit out of her. What the hell's\Nwrong with you?\NWhat? Logs.\NJust fix the damn engine. I am fixing\Nthe goddamn engine.\NI need your tour logs. I'm off the clock, okay? Well, I cannot\Nfile the quarterlies\Nuntil I have your log. I'm going through\Na little bit of a\Nlife change here, Dennis. I would really appreciate\Na little bit of sensitivity,\Nplease. CHRISTOPHER: I know they're\Nboth French, but that has\Nnothing to do with it. Because Manet was earlier\Nand... No. Monet and Manet\Nare very different things. I'm sorry, I beg to differ. Excuse me, sir, can I have her\Ncall you back personally? Yes. Okay, thank you.\NSorry. Brooke? I am so sorry.\NWhat? Come here. Oh, honey, your mom called\Nand told me everything. Oh, Jesus. Good morning, Marilyn. Morning.\NI'll go water the plants. I understand\Nyou had a long night.\NTell me everything. BROOKE: "Everything."\NI couldn't possibly... Then don't.\NMy time is pressing. What I want is for you\Nto take the rest\Nof the day off. Oh, no.\NNo, that's not necessary. Who am I? Marilyn Dean.\NAnd where are we? The Marilyn Dean Gallery.\NAnd of whom is that portrait? That is Marilyn Dean.\NYeah. You know, your personal life\Nis your personal life. But you look like shit.\NAnd when you look like shit, Marilyn Dean looks like shit,\Nand now it is my business. And when it comes to my\Nbusiness, I don't like\Nanything that's distracting. So, I want you to take\Nthe rest of the day off\Nto be sad and then come back\Nto work tomorrow ready\Nto take care of business. Got it? (ELEVATOR BELL DINGS) (ROCK MUSIC BLARING) (POOL BALLS CLACKING) Oh, hey, Brooke. How are you? What the hell are you doing? Well, my whole life,\NI always wanted my own place\Nwith my own pool table. I finally got my own place, but you would not allow me\Nto have a pool table. I just kind of figured\NI'd rectify that today.\NAnd it does feel good. I'm gonna go ahead\Nand put the four ball\Nin the corner pocket. Nice. I'm sorry, can I...\NA little room for the\Nshooter, please? It's hard to shoot\Nwith someone standing...\NThank you. (POOL BALLS CLACKING) Wow. Well, I guess he feels\Nthreatened that you broke up\Nwith him and he's acting out. Okay, look, Brooke,\Nmen are like children.\NYou know? And they... (WHISPERING) Sweetie, it's a\Nfigure of speech. It's Brooke.\NAnd I love you so much. And you're my man\Nand you know that.\NYou're amazing. I love you. Listen, and they're gonna\Ntest boundaries to see\Nwhat they can get away with. <i>I think there's three things</i>\N<i>that Gary needs to know.</i> One, this type of behavior\Nis not unnoticed.\NTwo, it's not acceptable. And three, you know,\Nyou're definitely not gonna\Ntolerate it. Right? Yes. <i>And Brooke, remember,</i>\N<i>we're always owning</i>\N<i>our actions, right?</i> <i>And we're always</i>\N<i>healthy with it, yes?</i> Yes. I don't wanna finish the game.\NI got showings, okay? I gotta buy the cookie spray.\NI gotta clean up the dog. (YOU OUGHTA KNOW PLAYING) And now I'm really leaving\N'cause I don't want\Nto hear that. Okay? Thank you for the pool.\NThank you for the snacks. I'm going to get a cab.\NI'll split it with you. What are you, 12?\NBrooke, that is not healthy. I'm trying to make a point.\NAnd what is that point? My point's your point.\NYour three points. That it's not unnoticed,\Nthat it was not acceptable, and that it would definitely\Nnot be tolerated. Not exactly what I meant. Unbelievable. I knew it!\NHey, gang. Found my shirt on the floor.\NThanks for laying it out. Gary, are you here\Nfor couples bowling?\NYeah. Well, don't you think\Nyou and I should discuss\Nsomething first? Like what? How your\N47 average is killing us? Okay. Great. No. Gary, this is couples bowling.\NAnd since you and I\Nare no longer a couple, because you have chosen not to participate\Nconstructively\Nin our relationship, we're now singles. So, there's not room\Nfor two singles on the team. Why do you look confused? I don't have any idea\Nwhat's happening.\NI've come to play on the team. Look, Gary, I just don't think\Nit's a good idea for you and I to be around\Neach other any more\Nthan we have to right now. I completely agree.\NMaybe you should go\Nplay some pinball. No, I think you should leave.\NOkay. Brooke, when a man makes\Na commitment to a team,\Nhe honors that commitment. He doesn't let emotions\Nor personal issues\Nget in the way of victory. And I've made a commitment\Nto this team. They don't want you here\Neither, Gary.\NYeah. Sure, they don't. They don't.\NThey're my friends. But you're not\Na strong bowler.\NThat's not the point. You know what? Let's just...\NWhy don't we let them decide? Gary, don't. No.\NDon't involve them, okay?\NThat's unnecessary. What's wrong, Castro?\NCastro? Well, Castro doesn't\Nlet people vote as a team. Okay. Ask them.\NThank you. Okay, everyone.\NTeam vote here. By a show of hands,\Njust put it up when you\Nmake a decision, who here agrees with Brooke\Nand thinks I should leave\Nthe bowling team? Shocker. <i>Band of Brothers.</i>\NYou should rent it sometime. Good luck, everyone.\NRiding Miss Gutter Ball\Nto the finals. Hey, Gary.\NYeah. I'm gonna need\Nyour shirt back.\NWhat? Well, we're gonna have to\Nreplace you, and you know\Nwe get docked 10 pins if everyone's not in matching\NPin Shakers uniforms. My shirt says "Gary" on it.\NGranted. But actually,\Nwe know a guy named Gary. And he's not as tall as you,\Nbut he's a pretty good bowler. I'm gonna have to request\Nthat I have my wrist guard\Nback then. I'm sorry. That's mine. Just give me\Nthe goddamn wrist guard,\Nplease. Thank you. I hope your wrist snaps. Wow. Okay? You see that?\NYou know what I mean? Yeah. That was awesome. You just had your\Nex-boyfriend, who you wish\Nyou were still dating, voted off the bowling team. Well, I had to do that\Nto get him right\Nwhere I want him. Where's that?\NShirtless in the parking lot? Addie,\Nyou're not getting this. Gary loves this bowling team.\NHe's hurt right now. He's feeling pretty bad. He's gonna go out there\Nand he's gonna get drunk. He's gonna make\Na complete fool of himself. And he will be sitting there\Nfeeling pretty Ionely and pretty pathetic,\Nand then it's just\Ngonna hit him. What's gonna hit him? That not only is he\Nout a girlfriend, but his life is just\Nfalling apart piece by piece and maybe that life\Nwas pretty great. And maybe I was the glue\Nthat was holding it all\Ntogether. And if he wants\Nthat life back, he's gonna have no choice\Nbut to change. (MUSIC PLAYING) How about this, huh?\NI feel like\Nwe just found hell. When did you start\Ncoming to knobby joints\Nlike this? I might be the greatest\Nyou've ever seen, pal. I'm conquering new frontiers.\NHello, babe. Yeah, you've got to put up\Nwith the bad music\Nand the $15 drinks, but this place is stacked\Nwith top-shelf, young,\Ndumb ass. All you gotta do is just\Nseparate the weaker ones\Nfrom the herd. Come on,\NI'll get you into the VIP. Can I get a couple drinks\Nfrom you?\NOkay, L.G. Lupus, I got to be totally...\NI got to be honest with you. I'm not feeling it here. You're gonna like it in here.\NYou're gonna love it. I don't like it out here.\NLook, listen to me,\Nwill you, please? How you doing, Buzz? While you were\Non the inside locked up\Nfor the past two years, the game has changed. (WOMEN CHEERING) Do you remember\Nwhen you were an outdoor cat and you used to have to hunt\Nand kill for your food? Well, you've become\Nan indoor cat. You've been getting your milk\Nbrought to you in a silver bowl,\Nand guess what? Now, you've been\Ntossed back outside and the alley has changed.\NFor example,\Nyour MTV generation, your technology,\Nyour text message,\Nyour TiVo. You name it. People want their\Ninformation faster. People e-mail each other\Nbecause they want to\Nexchange information, Gar. They don't want to connect,\Nthey want results. Okay.\NYou gotta get to\Nthe message quicker. Now, I want you to watch.\NIt's real simple. Okay? How you doing, ladies? Now, here's what I'd like\Nto do to you. First, I'd like to\Nget you naked. And then I'm gonna take\Nsome Saran Wrap and I'm gonna wrap you\Nup in it, head to toe. Then I'm gonna\Ncut out two holes. One for your mouth,\Nso you can breathe,\Nobviously. And the other one...\NAsshole. It could be a gorgeous\Nevening for us, babe. The pink is gorgeous.\NJesus, God. Come here.\NLupus, listen to me.\NI want you to listen to me. There are our drinks.\NYou want your drink? No, I'm fine.\NThank you.\NThe L.G. thanks you. Will you listen to me,\Nplease? You're my brother\Nand I love you very much, and maybe you do\Nget laid tonight,\Nbut maybe you get arrested. Arrested for what, babe?\NBeing awesome? Come on, babe, listen.\NYou want to tell your jokes,\Ntell your jokes. But sooner or later\Nyou're gonna get hungry\Nand you're gonna wanna eat. And jokes might\Nmake you feel better,\Nbut they don't get you fed. I'm gonna go take a lap. (DOOR OPENING) (DOOR SHUTTING) What are you doing?\NI'm sketching. And where are you sketching? In the living room.\NNo, in my bedroom. And I didn't say anything\Nto you, Brooke, when you so arrogantly\Nclaimed the bed\Nwithout asking me, but you can't just waltz\Ninto my room and turn it\Ninto a damn art fair. Gary, I've only taken up\Na little bit of space, so... I don't care if you only\Ntook an inch. There might not be\Na door here, but this\Nis my domain. Okay? I don't go into your bedroom\Nand set up a goddamn sawhorse. Well, then what the hell\Nis that pool table\Ndoing in the dining room? Because that's a common area.\NAnd that's where this belongs. Not in my room.\NHey, what are you doing? It belongs in another\Ncommon area.\NGary. People want to come home\Nand they want to relax\Nin their room. Gary, it is 2:00\Nin the morning! Don't you drop my things.\NI don't know\Nwhat to tell you, kid. This is how I am\Nwhen I'm single. My hours start to get\Npretty strange. Might be time for you\Nto think about moving out. Why would I...\NNo, I'm not moving anywhere. Gary, just please\Nturn the volume down. Yeah, but I don't tell you\Nwhat the hell to do\Nin your room. You can doodle. You can dance. You can bake\Na goddamn gingerbread house. I don't give a shit. But in my room,\NI want to relax\Nand watch my highlights in complete surround-sound\Nexperience. What the hell are you doing?\NYou're not even gonna\Nwatch it! Don't tell me what I am\Nor aren't not doing. Oh, what you are not,\Nnot doing? Go learn some English.\NOh, I'm sorry. I didn't have a grandfather\Non the board of\Nsome fancy college. Key word being "was."\NDid he touch the Filipino\Nexchange student? Did he not touch\Nthe exchange student? I don't know, Brooke.\NI wasn't there.\NOkay. No, don't start\Nwith the family stuff. Like your family's so perfect?\NYour brother's a pervert! Don't talk to me about\Nthe sexual habits\Nof family members. What about your sister? My sister's\Nbeen through a lot.\NOf dick. There are some problems, Gary,\Nbut can we please\Njust leave it... Problems? She slept with\Nthe entire Arizona Cardinals\Noffensive line. That's not problems.\NThat's she's the problem! She was on vacation!\NShe was on vacation. Don't even get me started,\Nby the way, on your brother. If I have to hear\Nthat guy sing\Njust one more time, I'd hang myself\Nwith wax dental floss. Could the guy just\Ncome out of the closet,\Nplease? Richard is not gay. Okay, lassie,\NI want you to listen to me\Nand listen good. I'm not saying\Nhe won't get married. I'm not saying\Nhe won't even have kids. But then one day\Nhis wife will come home, and then she'll find him\Nwith a guy named Majulio, wearing leather helmets\Nand clubbing each other\Nto Yanni's greatest hits. Yeah. Right. Whatever.\NYou're an infant. Yeah, I'm an infant. Go enjoy your room, Brooke,\N'cause I'm gonna enjoy mine! Okay.\NYou know what? I might enjoy\Nsome pay-per-view\Noptions tonight. It's gonna be a long one,\Nsweetheart, and I got nothing to do <i>mañana</i>\Nbut sleep in. (DOOR SLAMMING) (BOOGIE NIGHTS PLAYING) (SINGING) <i>Boogie nights</i>\N<i>Ain't no doubt</i>\N<i>we are here to party</i> What are you doing? <i>Boogie nights</i>\N<i>Come on now,</i>\N<i>got to get it started</i> Ricky, you and\Nthe Get Along Gang leave or I'm gonna\Nthrow you out of here\Npersonally, you understand? Actually, Gary,\Nthis is Brooke's bedroom. So, technically,\Nyou don't have\Njurisdiction here, but I think it'd be really fun\Nif you sang with us. Come on, Gary.\NI think you'll like it. You got 10 seconds\Nto get out of here or I'm gonna break\Nyour damn magic whistle. You understand\Nwhat I'm saying to you? Move this group\Nout of my house, now! (EXCLAIMING) (GRUNTING) (ALL SINGING) Gary, you can't take\Na pitch pipe\Nout of a guy's hand when he's in the middle\Nof a very funky groove. You can get hurt\Ndoing something like that. I'm tapping out,\NI'm tapping out! Here we go. From the bridge. (SINGING) <i>Party night</i>\N<i>Get on down</i>\N<i>with the sound of the music</i> <i>Boogie nights</i>\N<i>Do it, do it</i> What kind of bullshit move\Nwas that? I'm sorry. What?\NWhat happened?\NOh, don't be coy with me. You sent that animal over here\Nto attack me when I was\Nhung over and weak. Oh, no. Look, all I know\Nis The Tone Rangers, they needed someplace\Nto rehearse, so I very clearly\Ntold Richard,\N"Stay in my room," which you explained to me\Nwas my space to do\Nwith what I want. Is that how\Nyou want to play it?\N'Cause I'll play it like that. I'll play it like\NLionel Richie. All night long, lady.\NOh, yeah. I'll call some guys\Nfrom my neck of the woods. And we're not talking, Brooke, about a couple of queens\Nwho know a few grapples. We're talking about Polacks\Nthat don't have\Na goddamn future. Right.\NThat's right! We can make shit\Nreal uncomfortable\Naround here, and that's what\Nwe're gonna do. Please. Come on.\NYou know what? You're just embarrassed\Nbecause Richard\Nkicked your ass. Richard did not kick my ass. What Richard did was attack me\Nwhen I was half asleep. Really?\NIs that how you see it? There's a really big gap\Nbetween getting\Nyour ass kicked and having\Na dancing, singing sprite\Nfool you with trickery and then strike your throat\Nbefore you know that\Nyou're even in a fight. And I wouldn't expect\Nsomeone like you\Nto understand that, because all you ever do\Nis make moves from\Nup in your ivy tower. Wow. You have officially\Ngone off the reservation. I'm an adult.\NI talk through shit.\NHe ran out of ideas. God. Listen, by the way,\Nthere's messages\Non the voice mail regarding game night,\Nwhich is obviously\Nnot gonna happen, so you might want to\Ncall people and tell them\Nthat it's canceled. Why would I cancel game night?\NWell, I mean... If it's our turn to host game,\NI'm gonna host\Ngoddamn game night. You want to host game night?\NI'm fine, Brooke. I don't have any strangeness\Nover what happened here today. Okay. If there's anyone\Nthat should feel weird\Nabout seeing people, that's you, Tonya Harding.\NMe? I'm gonna honor\Nmy commitments. Great.\NGreat. Fine.\NFine. Let's do that.\NLet's do that. Let's honor the commitment. (WATER RUNNING) Hey, there's no food in there!\NBROOKE: So? Well, people are gonna\Nbe here in an hour.\NWhat are they supposed to eat? You're a big boy.\NFigure it out. Oh, great.\NWell, that's what we got. We have only tap water\Nbecause, you know,\NGary didn't shop. BROOKE: And we don't have\Nany ice either 'cause\Nhe didn't fill the trays. That's trash. It's your shot.\NWhat is your name again? Diane.\NDiane. GARY: Did you call?\NJOHNNY O: I called the five. Well, yeah,\Nbut you didn't call\Nthe second ball, so that's trash,\Nso it's your shot. GARY: You got to play\Nby the rules. It's your shot. Hi.\NHi. Andrew.\NBROOKE: Oh, hi. Whoa, whoa, whoa!\NHey, hey, hey! These two Benedict Arnolds\Naren't welcome in my condo. Who sent an invite to them?\NI'm sorry. These are very loyal friends\Nand they are always welcome\Nin my condo. Oh, really? Why don't we\Ntake it to a vote and see\Nwho has the numbers this time? GARY: All right.\NShow of hands here. Who thinks that these two\Ntraitors should leave and\Nnot be a part of game night? And maybe take their shirts\Noff when they leave. Raise your hand.\NI know I feel that way.\NWho else? GARY: Come on, Johnny O,\Nput your hand up, please. Come on. Thank you.\NYou, Miss? New girl. Who's the girl?\NWhat's her name?\NWhat's her name?

Mind-meld.\NI heard you! Don't over-think it.\NMind meld.\NANDREW: Ready? I heard you!\NWell, just keep it simple. Shush. Ready? Wait. Go!\NHere we go!\NWe're mind-melding. Draw faster.\NIt doesn't have\Nto be beautiful, just has to be\Nsomething we can get.\NShoe, shoe... Shoe! Shoe, shoe, shoe. Shoeless Joe Jackson.\NDraw something different.\NNo one's getting it. Shoe. What, is that\Na smaller shoe?\NJOHNNY O: Baby shoe. Smaller shoe. Baby shoes.\NJOHNNY O: Shoes. Baby shoes.\NSmaller shoe. Gumshoe. GARY: Smaller shoes.\NDIANE: Gumshoe? Gumshoe? Running Olympics.\NJOHNNY O: Inside the shoe. Inside a shoe. A bubble...\NJOHNNY O: Lining. Stop pointing at the shoe.\NWe're not...\NNo one's guessing shoe. Stop pointing at the shoe\Nand draw something different. (TIMER RINGING)\NDraw something different.\NYou... Goddamn it!\NNo one's guessing shoe! You drew a big shoe,\Nthen a small shoe,\Nand no one got it. You gotta draw something\Ndifferent. Everyone said\N"shoe" seven times. It's a sock, asshole. You call yourself an artist?\NYes! A three-year-old with\Na box of crayons could\Ndo a better job than this. I'm sorry, I don't have\Nthe great talent of standing\Non top of a big red bus and pointing out architecture\Nthat other great men\Nhave built! I'm the one who should\Nbe sorry, Brooke. I shouldn't sit here\Nand pick on your art.\NNo. Because you got\Nthe nuts part down,\NPicasso. GARY: All you have\Nto do is\Ncut off your frigging ear. BROOKE: That's Van Gogh,\Nyou idiot! And your insults\Nare much more effective\Nwhen they're accurate. Don't talk to me about\Nbeing goddamn accurate! I can talk to you\Nabout anything that I want. 'Cause you couldn't even\Ndraw a sock. You don't do anything right!\NYou're a lazy... Everyone said,\N"Shoe, shoe, shoe!" At first,\NI figured that the split\Nwas just something temporary, something that you two\Nwould work out and get past, but after tonight\NI think it's pretty clear that you two genuinely\Ndo not want to\Nget back together. There's not a shot in hell.\NGary. I'm just...\NI got you. As your friend\Nand as your realtor, I'm not gonna\Nleave here tonight until we decide\Nwhat to do about this condo, because this living situation\Nis obviously not working out. Gary? Well, the only logical thing\Nthat I can think of is for her to move out\Nof the condo, and then to pay me some\Nsort of a penalty\Nas compensation for the labor that I did\Nall around the condo.\NWhat? What? What? Pay you compensation\Nfor your labor? We fixed this place up\Ntogether.\NAre you nuts? Stop calling me nuts,\NI swear to God.\NI fixed the... You went around with a sponge, and you went in the bathroom\Nand you dotted foofy shit. That's what you're saying\Nthat I did?\NGARY: There's no... BROOKE: That was...\NThat's called aesthetics. It warmed this place up\Nso it didn't look like an army barracks,\Nwhich it was about to. I'll tell you what\Nit's called in his language,\Ndepreciated. That's what it's called.\NYou don't even know\Nwhat that means. Unless the next buyer\Nhappens to have your same\NZulu-voodoo-land taste. All right.\NLet me tell you\Nsomething else. It's gonna cost money\Nto cover up the holes\Nin the wall. The holes that you drilled\Nin the wall there to hang up\Nwhatever that thing is called. Oh, please. Gary. GARY: You're gonna have\Nto cost money to fix that. What I did, Brooke,\Nhas concrete value\Nto the condo. I added concrete...\NWell, let's just go on record. We're dealing with facts here.\NI did the tiling\Nin the bathroom. Have you seen...\NI did the new track lighting. That tile is the\Nshittiest tile job.\NGARY: I did the plumbing! The plumbing!\NThat's realty terms. Okay. Let's talk\Nabout your plumbing.\NThis is his plumbing. We have two temperatures\Nin our bathroom. We get either scalding hot\Nor we get frostbite. That's it. That's all we get.\NIt's my problem that she doesn't know how\Nto pace a shower? GARY: Now all of a sudden\Nthat's my fault. I get a minute\Nto take a shower. One minute?\NBROOKE: One minute of warmth? Oh, Jesus. One minute.\NThat's it. That's correct. Thank God you're not\Nin charge of keeping all the\Nclocks in Chicago on time. This is basic logic.\NYou are out of your mind.\NYou have lost it. Let me explain this to you\Nin plain chapter and verse. Cheese and rice,\Nyou guys are gonna kill\Neach other. Now, let's just... Realistically speaking,\Nneither one of you can afford this mortgage\Non your own, okay? And that's a shame,\Nbecause this building will\Ncontinue to increase in value. I get nothing but\Nphone calls about it,\Nall right? Waiting for a unit to open up. So, as your realtor,\Nthe last thing I would suggest\Nis selling. But as your friend,\NI just, I don't see\Nany other solution. You take your halves,\Nyou go your separate ways, and you get on\Nwith your lives. I know that selling is not\Nthe easiest thing, but\NI do think that it's the best. And to be honest,\Nthis is a situation where I would just as soon\Nnot take a commission. That's great. Thank you.\NThat's great.\NThank you for that. I wish I didn't have to,\Nyou know, but company policy says\NI cannot waive that. But I was just...\NYou know, I'm saying\Nin theory, you know. In this situation,\N'cause we're friends,\NI wish I could waive it. No can do, though. As soon as you can,\NI would love to get\Na set of keys from you guys. You just drop them off.\NOkay. Great. There they are. I'll be bringing by\Npeople all week. You won't even know I'm here.\NThe good news is,\Nshould move quickly. All right. Okay to leave you two\Nalone now? Got to get back to Jen.\NVery excited about\Nthe win tonight. Okay. (DOOR OPENING) (DOOR CLOSING) BROOKE: Addie,\Nif the condo sells,\NI think I'm gonna lose him. ADDIE ON PHONE:\N<i>Yeah, but game night</i>\N<i>was so light and fun,</i> <i>I'm really surprised</i>\N<i>to be hearing this.</i> Okay. You know what?\NThat's not constructive.\NReally. I just... Yeah, I need\Na new plan, Addie. I don't... (SNICKERING) I'm just kidding. It's me. I'm gonna have to\Ncall you back. Whenever one of my friends\Nis down, we all go on,\Nlike, happy patrol. I was actually having\Na very serious conversation. (SINGING)\NChristopher, do not sing. (SINGING) <i>If you're happy</i>\N<i>and you know it</i>\N<i>Clap your hands</i> <i>If you're happy</i>\N<i>and you know it</i>\N<i>Clap your hands</i> <i>If you're happy</i>\N<i>and you know it</i>\N<i>You're going to smile to...</i> (DOOR SLAMS) Pack up your shit and go home. Okay. You know what?\NThis is not his fault. He was just really trying\Nto cheer me up and it... Did I or did I not give you\Nthe day off to be sad? Yes. But I...\NWell, today's not that day, and unfortunately for you,\NI can't afford to look weak. No, please. You have warned me\Nso many times\Nand you have yet to fire me. I think you and I both know\Nthat to find and train\Nsomebody new, it's gonna cost you time,\Nand it's gonna cost you money, and I don't think you want\Nto spend either one of those. Now, look, I'm just gonna\Ntake a wild guess here, but you don't become\NMarilyn Dean without knowing\Nhow to handle men. Okay? Now, just listen\Nto my problem, tell me how to fix it,\Nand then we'll all\Ngo back to work. Okay.

But you've gotta\Ntell me exactly\Nwhat you're gonna tell them, if the cops come to you.\NBecause if we tell\Na different story... Nothing.\NPromise me one thing.\NWe don't care... John, I'm gonna go home.\NI can't do this.\NI'm exhausted. Right, go home. Just make sure\Nyour neighbors know\Nyou're going home. Do me a favor.\NThey got phone records.
