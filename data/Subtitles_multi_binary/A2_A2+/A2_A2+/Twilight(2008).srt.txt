I'd never given much thought\Nto how I would die. But dying in the place\Nof someone I love... seems like a good way to go. So I can't bring myself to... regret the decision\Nto leave home. I would miss Phoenix. I'd miss the heat. I would miss my\Nloving, erratic, harebrained mother. Okay. Renee, come on.\N- And her new husband. Guys, come on.\NI love you both. We got a plane to catch. But they want to\Ngo on the road, so I'm gonna spend\Nsome time with my dad, and this will be a good thing. I think. When the thorn\Nbush turns white That's when I'll come home I am going out to\Nsee what I can sow And I don't know where I'll go And I don't know what I'll see In the state of Washington, under a near constant cover\Nof clouds and rain, there's a small\Ntown named Forks. Population, 3, 120 people. This is where I'm moving. My dad's Charlie. He's the chief of police. Curse the powers that be Cause all I want is... Your hair's longer. I cut it since the\Nlast time I saw you. Guess it grew out again. I used to spend two weeks here\Nalmost every summer, but it's been years. I've cleared some shelves off\Nin the bathroom. Right. One bathroom. It's a pretty good work lamp. The sales lady picked\Nout the bed stuff. You like purple, right? Purple's cool. Thanks. Okay. One of the best\Nthings about Charlie, he doesn't hover. Heard you guys coming\Nall the way down the road. Good to see you. Bella, you remember\NBilly Black. Yeah. Wow, you're looking good.\N- Well, I'm still dancing. I'm glad you're finally here. Charlie here hasn't\Nshut up about it... since you told him\Nyou were coming. All right, keep exaggerating.\NI'll roll you into the mud. After I ram you in the ankles. You want to go?\N- Yeah. Bring it. Hi, I'm Jacob.\N- Hey. We used to make mud pies\Nwhen we were little. Right. No, I remember. Are they always like this? It's getting worse\Nwith old age. Good. So, what do you think? Of what? Your homecoming present.\N- This? Just bought it off Billy here.\N- Yep. I totally rebuilt\Nthe engine for you. Come on. Oh, my gosh. This is perfect.\NAre you joking me? Sorry. I told you she'd love it. I'm down with the kids. Oh, yeah, dude.\NYou're the bomb. Okay. Listen, you gotta double-pump\Nthe clutch when you shift, but besides that,\Nyou should be good. That's this one?\N- Yeah. Yeah, right there. All right. Do you want a ride to\Nschool or something? I go to school on\Nthe reservation. Right, right.\N- Yeah. That's too bad. It would've been nice\Nto know one person. My first day at a new school. It's March, middle\Nof the semester. Great. Nice ride.\N- Thanks. Good one. You're Isabella\NSwan, the new girl. Hi, I'm Eric, the eyes\Nand ears of this place. Anything you need, tour guide, lunch date,\Nshoulder to cry on? I'm really kind of the more\Nsuffer-in-silence type. Good headline\Nfor your feature. I'm on the paper, and you're news,\Nbaby, front page. No, I'm not. You... Please don't have\Nany sort of... Chillax. No feature. Okay, thanks.\N- Cool? All right. Okay. Yeah. Get it. Get it. Get it. To you. Whoa. I'm sorry. I told them not\Nto let me play. No way. No, no, no.\NThat's... That's... Don't... You're Isabella, right? Just Bella. Yeah. Hey, I'm Mike Newton. Nice to meet you.\N- Yeah, yeah. She's got a great spike, huh?\N- Yeah, it's... I'm Jessica, by the way. Hey, you're from\NArizona, right? Yeah. Aren't people from Arizona... supposed to be,\Nlike, really tan? Yeah. Maybe that's why\Nthey kicked me out. You're good. That's so funny. Back in, Jess.\N- Down here. Like a masterpiece, you know, we'll have, like, this crazy pyramid\Nfall from the sky, and then you guys can...\N- It's my pleasure, Madame. You guys can give each\Nother high fives. Burrito, my friend? Hey, Mikey. You met\Nmy home girl, Bella? Hey. Your home girl? Yeah.\N- Yeah? That's...\N- My girl. Sorry I had to mess\Nup your game, Mike. Tyler. Yes. Oh, my God. It's like first\Ngrade all over again. You're the shiny new toy. Smile. Okay.\N- Sorry. I needed a candid\Nfor the feature. The feature's dead, Angela. Don't bring it up again. It's okay, I just... I got your back, baby. Guess we'll just run\Nanother editorial... on teen drinking. You know, you can always go\Nfor eating disorders. Speedo padding on\Nthe swim team. Actually, that's a good one. Kirk. Right? That's\Nexactly what I thought. Yeah. We're talking Olympic-size. There's no way.\NHe's so skinny. It doesn't make sense. Totally.\N- Yeah. Who are they? The Cullens. They're Dr. and Mrs.\NCullen's foster kids. They moved down\Nhere from Alaska, like, a few years ago. They kind of keep\Nto themselves. Yeah, 'cause they're\Nall together. Like, together, together. The blonde girl,\Nthat's Rosalie, and the big dark-haired\Nguy, Emmett, they're, like, a thing. I'm not even sure\Nthat's legal. Jess, they're not\Nactually related. Yeah, but they live\Ntogether. It's weird. And, okay, the little\Ndark-haired girl's Alice. She's really weird, and she's with Jasper,\Nthe blond one... who looks like he's in pain. Dr. Cullen's like this\Nfoster dad/matchmaker. Maybe he'll adopt me. Who's he? That's Edward Cullen. He's totally\Ngorgeous, obviously, but apparently nobody here's\Ngood enough for him. Like I care, you know? So, yeah. Seriously, like,\Ndon't waste your time. I wasn't planning on it. Mr. Molina.\N- Hey, Mike. Oh, yes. Miss Swan. Hi. Can I have the\Npass? Thank you. Welcome to the class.\NHere. Here's your stuff, okay? And I got a seat\Nfor you right here, so come over. The last one. Just follow along\Ntill you catch up. All right, guys, today\Nwe are gonna be... observing the\Nbehavior of planaria, aka flatworms. So what we're gonna do... ...regenerate. Zombie worms. No cell phones. Guys,\Nlet's get to it. Gentle, gentle, certain areas. Please just don't cut here.\NWe don't cut here. You won't believe this. Let's try to focus... while we check those\Nout, huh, guys? There must be something open. Physics? Biochem?\N- No, every class is full. Just a minute, dear. I'm afraid you'll have\Nto stay in biology. Fine. Just... I'll just\Nhave to endure it. I just can't get over\Nhow grown up you are. And so gorgeous. Hey, Bella. You remember me? I played Santa one year. Yeah, Waylon, she hasn't had... a Christmas here\Nsince she was four. I bet I made an impression,\Nthough, didn't I? You always do.\N- Butt-crack Santa? Hey, kids love those\Nlittle bottles, though. All right, let the girl eat her\Ngarden burger, Waylon. As soon as you're done, I will bring you\Nyour favorite. Berry cobbler, remember? Your dad still has\Nit. Every Thursday. Thank you. That'd be great. Here. Thanks. Hey, baby. So, listen,\Nif spring training goes well, we could be moving to Florida. Please insert $1.25... for an additional\Nthree minutes. Mom, where's your cell? Okay, don't laugh. I didn't lose my power\Ncord. It ran away. Screaming. I literally\Nrepel technology now. I miss you.\N- Oh, baby, I miss you, too. But tell me more\Nabout your school. Now, what are the kids like? Are there any cute guys? Are they being nice to you? Well, they're all very welcoming. Tell me all about it. It doesn't even matter. Yes, it does, honey. I have homework to do.\NI'll talk to you later. Okay. I love you. Love you, too. I planned to confront him... and demand to know\Nwhat his problem was. But he never showed. Bella. And the next day,\Nanother no-show. More days passed. Things were getting\Na little strange. You all right?\N- Yeah, I'm good. Ice doesn't really help\Nthe uncoordinated. Yeah. That's why I had... some new tires\Nput on the truck. Old ones were\Ngetting pretty bald. Well, probably be\Nlate for dinner. I gotta head down\Nto Mason County. Security guard at\Nthe Grisham Mill... got killed by some\Nkind of animal. An animal? You're not in Phoenix\Nanymore, Bells. Anyway, I figured\NI'd lend a hand. Be careful.\N- Always am. And thanks for the tires.\N- Yeah. Prom Committee is\Na chick thing, but I gotta cover it\Nfor the paper anyway, and they need a guy\Nto help choose the music, so I need your play list. Hey, listen, I was wondering,\Ndid you have a date to... What's up, Arizona? Huh? How you liking the rain, girl? Better get used to it, girl. Yeah, Mike, hey,\Nyou're real cute, man. Oh, I know...\N- That was really awesome. Why you shooting down my game?\NLet a playa play. Yeah, okay.\NWhat you playing at, T-Ball? Hello. I'm sorry, I didn't\Nget a chance... to introduce myself last week. I'm Edward Cullen. You're Bella? Yes. Onion root tip cells, that's what's on your\Nslides right now. Okay? So, separate\Nand label them... into the phases of mitosis, and the first partners\Nthat get it right... are gonna win\Nthe Golden Onion. All right, good. Ladies first. You were gone. Yeah. I was out of town\Nfor a couple of days. Personal reasons. Prophase. Do you mind if I look? It's prophase. Like I said. So are you enjoying the rain? What? You're asking me\Nabout the weather? Yeah, I... I guess I am. Well, I don't really\Nlike the rain. Any cold, wet thing,\NI don't really... What?\N- Nothing. It's anaphase. You mind if I check?\N- Sure. Anaphase. Like I said. If you hate the cold\Nand the rain so much, why'd you move to\Nthe wettest place... in the continental US? It's complicated. I'm sure I can keep up. My mom remarried, and... So you don't like\Nthe guy, or... No, that's not... Phil's really nice. It's metaphase. You\Nwant to check it? I believe you. Why didn't you move\Nwith your mother and Phil? Well, Phil's a minor\Nleague baseball player, and he travels a lot, and my mom stayed\Nhome with me, but I knew it\Nmade her unhappy, so I figured I'd stay\Nwith my dad for a while. And now you're unhappy. No.\N- I'm sorry, I'm just... I'm just trying to\Nfigure you out. You're very difficult\Nfor me to read. Hey, did you get contacts? No. Your eyes were black\Nthe last time I saw you, and now they're,\Nlike, golden brown. Yeah, I know, it's the... It's the fluorescents. Bella.\N- Bella. Dial 911. I already called. They're gonna send\Nsomebody over soon. Bella, I'm so\Nsorry. I panicked. Bella, I've got 911\Non the phone now. Bella. You okay? You and I are gonna\Ntalk. You all right? I'm fine, Dad. Calm down. I'm sorry, Bella.\NI tried to stop. I know. It's okay. No. It sure as\Nhell is not okay. Dad, it wasn't his fault. You could've been killed.\NYou understand that? Yes. But I wasn't, so... You can kiss your\Nlicense goodbye. I heard the chief's\Ndaughter was here. Dr. Cullen. Charlie. I've got this one, Jackie. Isabella. Bella. Well, Bella, looks like\Nyou took quite a spill. How do you feel? Good. Look here. You might experience some... post-traumatic stress\Nor disorientation, but your vitals look good. No signs of any head trauma. I think you'll be just fine. I'm so sorry, Bella.\NI'm really... You know, it would've been a\Nwhole lot worse... if Edward wasn't there.\NHe knocked me out of the way. Edward? Your boy? Yeah, it was amazing. I mean, he got to me so fast.\NHe was nowhere near me. Sounds like you\Nwere very lucky. Charlie. I gotta go sign\Nsome paperwork. You should... You should probably\Ncall your mom. Did you tell her? She's probably just... freaking out. fifteen kids that saw\Nwhat happened. What was I supposed\Nto do, then? Let her die? This isn't just about you.\NIt's about all of us. I think we should\Ntake this in my office. Can I talk to\Nyou for a minute? Rosalie. What? How did you get\Nover to me so fast? I was standing right\Nnext to you, Bella. No. You were next to your car,\Nacross the lot. No, I wasn't. Yes, you were. Bella, you're...\NYou hit your head. I think you're confused. I know what I saw. And what exactly was that? You... You stopped the van. You pushed it away\Nwith your hand. Well, nobody's gonna\Nbelieve you, so... I wasn't gonna tell anybody. I just need to know the truth. Can't you just thank\Nme and get over it? Thank you. You're not gonna let\Nthis go, are you? No. Well, then I hope you\Nenjoy disappointment. And that was the first night\NI dreamt of Edward Cullen. I need everybody's\Npermission slips, okay? Sammy, please collect them.\N- Yeah. Guys, let's go. Come on, get in. In. Let's go. Look at you, huh?\NYou're alive. I know, yeah. False\Nalarm, I guess. Yeah. Now, I wanted to ask you,\Nyou know, if, you know, it's like a month away, but... Do you wanna go\Nto prom with me? So, what do you think? About what?\N- Do you want to go? To prom? With me? I... Prom. Dancing. Not such a good idea for me. I have something\Nthat weekend anyway. I'm going to Jacksonville\Nthat weekend. You can't go another weekend? Non-refundable ticket. You should ask Jessica. I know she wants\Nto go with you. All right. All right. Yo, yo, yo. Hey,\Nguys, come on. We gotta go. We gotta go.\NGreen is what? Good. Let's go. Guys, come on. Other bus, other\Nbus. Let's go. Egg shells, carrot tops. Compost is cool. Now, stuff that\Nin there, Eric. Yes, sir. Yes, sir.\N- Very good, very good. Now, I am gonna make\Na steaming cup... of compost tea. Okay.\N- Give me that. Yeah. This is recycling\Nin its most basic form, guys. Don't drink it. It's\Nfor the plants. What's in Jacksonville? How did you know about that? You didn't answer my question. You don't answer\Nany of mine, so... I mean, you don't\Neven say hi to me. Hi. Are you gonna tell me\Nhow you stopped the van? Yeah. I had an\Nadrenaline rush. It's very common.\NYou can Google it. Floridians. That's what's in Jacksonville. Can you at least\Nwatch where you walk? Look, I'm sorry I'm\Nbeing rude all the time. I just think it's\Nthe best way. Bella. Guess who just\Nasked me to prom. Who? Yeah, I actually\Ntotally thought... that Mike was gonna ask you. It's not gonna be\Nweird, though, right? No. Zero weirdness. You guys are great together.\N- I know, right? Tyler...\N- Gross. Bella, look. It's a worm. It's a worm. Bella, we shouldn't\Nbe friends. You really should've figured\Nthat out a little earlier. I mean, why didn't you just\Nlet the van crush me... and save yourself\Nall this regret? What, you think I\Nregret saving you? I can see that you do.\NI just... I don't know why. You don't know anything. Hi. Are you gonna be\Nriding with us? No, our bus is full. Your mom called. Again. Well, that's your fault. You shouldn't have told her... about the 'almost'\Naccident. You finished? Yeah. Yeah, I suppose you're right. She always did\Nknow how to worry. She seems different. She seems happy. Phil sounds like\Nan all right guy. Yeah, he is. All right. No, you need the mitts.\NYou need them. No, why do you keep\Narguing with me? You just need them. You're gonna get frostbite.\N- I don't even know. Yeah. Hey. La Push, baby. You in? Should I know what that means? La Push Beach down\Nat the Quileute Rez. We're all going tomorrow. Yeah, there's a big\Nswell coming in. And I don't just\Nsurf the Internet. Eric, you stood up once,\Nand it was a foam board. But there's whale\Nwatching, too. Come with us. La Push, baby. It's La Push. Okay, I'll go if you\Nstop saying that, okay? Seriously, dude.\NIt's creepy, man. What? That's what it's called.\N- So... Edible art? Bella. Thanks. You know, your mood swings... are kind of giving\Nme whiplash. I only said it'd be better\Nif we weren't friends, not that I didn't wanna be. What does that mean? It means if you were smart,\Nyou'd stay away from me. Okay, well, let's say\Nfor argument's sake... that I'm not smart. Would you tell me the truth?\N- No, probably not. I'd rather hear your theories. I have considered... radioactive spiders\Nand Kryptonite. That's all superhero\Nstuff, right? What if I'm not the hero?\NWhat if I'm the bad guy? You're not. I can see what you're\Ntrying to put off, but I can see that it's just\Nto keep people away from you. It's a mask. Why don't we just hang out? Everybody's going\Nto the beach. Come. I mean, have fun. Which beach?\N- La Push. I don't know. I just... Is there something\Nwrong with that beach? It's just a little crowded. Hey, it's freezing.\N- I'm paddling out, Coates. I don't know if it's\Nworth it anymore. We drove all the way out here. I'm at least paddling out.\N- Yeah. She's right.\N- You guys are babies. So, I keep thinking\Nthat Eric's... gonna ask me to the prom, and then he just doesn't. You should ask him. Take control. You're a strong,\Nindependent woman. I am?\N- Yes. Hey, will you do me up?\N- Yeah. Bella.\N- Hi, Jacob. Guys, this is Jacob.\N- Hey, guys. How you doing? Hi.\N- Hi. What are you,\Nlike, stalking me? You're on my rez, remember? Are you surfing? Definitely not.\N- Thanks. You guys should\Nkeep Bella company. Her date bailed. What date? She invited Edward. To be polite, that's it. I think it's nice\Nshe invited him. Nobody ever does. Yeah, 'cause Cullen's a freak. You got that right. You guys know him? The Cullens don't come here. What did your\Nfriends mean about, you know, 'The Cullens\Ndon't come here?' You caught that, huh? I'm not really supposed\Nto say anything about it. Hey, I can keep a secret. Really, it's just like\Nan old scary story. Well, I want to know. Okay, did you know Quileutes... are supposedly\Ndescended from wolves? What? Like, wolves? Yeah.\N- Like, real wolves? Well, that's the\Nlegend of our tribe. Okay. So what's the story\Nabout the Cullens? Well, they're\Nsupposedly descended... from this, like, enemy clan. My great grandfather,\Nthe chief, found them hunting\Non our land. But they claimed to be\Nsomething different, so we made a treaty with them. If they promised to stay\Noff Quileute lands, then we wouldn't expose... what they really were\Nto the palefaces. I thought they\Njust moved here. Or just moved back. Right. It touched my hand.\NA snake. Stop. Well, what are they really? It's just a story, Bella. Come on, let's go. A snake. A snake. My mama said I didn't know\Nhow to make a kitty meow Hello? Gerald? Gerald? Hello. Nice jacket. Who are you? It's always the same\Ninane questions. 'Who are you?' 'What do you want?' 'Why are you doing this?' James, let's not\Nplay with our food. He's not here. Whenever the weather's nice,\Nthe Cullens disappear. What, do they just ditch? No, Dr. and Mrs. Cullen\Nyank them out... for, like, hiking and\Ncamping and stuff. I tried that out\Non my parents. Not even close. Guys, I'm going to\Nthe prom with Eric. I just asked him.\NI took control. I told you that would happen. Are you sure you have\Nto go out of town? Oh, yeah, it's a\Nlittle family thing. Okay, we should go shopping\Nin Port Angeles... before all the good\Ndresses get cleaned out. Port Angeles? You\Nmind if I come? Yeah, I need your opinion. I like this one.\N- That's cool. But, like, I don't know about\Nthe one-shoulder thing. I like this one.\N- Yeah, I like the beading, and you wouldn't need jewelry. Jess, what do you\Nthink? Lavender? Is that good? Is\Nthat my color? I like it. I liked that dusty\Nrose one, too. Okay, I like this one.\NIt makes my boobs look good. Hey.\N- Right? Nice. Oh, God.\N- That is uncomfortable. That's disgusting. Bella, what do you think? Yes? That looks great. You said that about, like,\Nthe last five dresses, though. I thought they were\Nall pretty good. You're not really\Ninto this, are you? I actually really just want\Nto go to this bookstore. I'll meet you guys\Nat the restaurant? Are you sure? Yeah, yeah. I'll\Nsee you in a minute. Okay.\N- Okay. She's right, though.\NThis looks awesome. There you go. Have a good night.\N- Thank you. Saw you in the dress store.\N- Hey, where you running to? There she is. What's up?\N- It's my girl. How you guys doing?\N- Look who we just found. What's up, girl? Hey...\NWhere you going? Where are you going?\N- Come get a drink with us. Yeah, you should\Nhang out with us. Come on. It's fun. What's the problem?\N- She doesn't like that, man. You're pretty.\N- Don't touch me. Cute. Really, no. Seriously,\Nyou should. Don't touch me. Get in the car. That was a very\Ndangerous maneuver. I should go back there\Nand rip those guys' heads off. No, you shouldn't. You don't know the vile,\Nrepulsive things... they were thinking. And you do? It's not hard to guess. Can you talk about\Nsomething else? Distract me so I\Nwon't turn around. You should put\Nyour seatbelt on. You should put\Nyour seatbelt on. I thought the salad\Nwas pretty good. Hey, you guys, I'm\Nsorry. I just... Where were you? We\Nleft you messages. Yeah, we waited,\Nbut we were, like, starving, so we... I'm sorry I kept\NBella from dinner. We just sort of ran\Ninto each other... and got talking. Yeah.\N- No. No, we totally understand.\NI mean, that happens, right? Yeah, we were... We were, yeah, we were\Njust leaving. So... Let's get this... Bella, if you wanna... I think I should make sure\NBella gets something to eat. If you'd like. I'll drive you home myself. That's so thoughtful. It's really thoughtful. Yeah. Yeah. I should eat something. Yeah. Okay, so we'll\Nsee you tomorrow. Okay, yeah. See ya.\N- Okay. All right, one\Nmushroom ravioli. Thanks.\N- Yeah, no problem. So are you sure\Nthere isn't anything I can get for you? No. No, thank you. Let me know. You're really not gonna eat? No, I'm on a special diet. You gotta give\Nme some answers. Yes, no. To get to the other side. 1.77245... I don't want to know\Nwhat the square root of pi is. You knew that? How did you know where I was? I didn't. All right.\N- What? Don't leave. I... Did you follow me? I... I feel very protective of you. So you followed me. I was trying to\Nkeep a distance... unless you needed my help, and then I heard what\Nthose low-lifes... were thinking. Wait. You say you heard what\Nthey were thinking? So what, you... You read minds? I can read every\Nmind in this room. Apart from yours. There's money, sex, money, sex, cat. And then you, nothing. It's very frustrating. Is there something\Nwrong with me? See, I tell you\NI can read minds, and you think there's\Nsomething wrong with you. What is it? I don't have the strength\Nto stay away from you anymore. Then don't. Okay, I think I'm\Nwarm enough now. Your hand is so cold. Whoa. What is going on? My dad's still here. Can you pull in? That's my father's\Ncar on the end. What is he doing here? Carlisle, what's going on? Waylon Forge was\Nfound in a boat... out near his place. I just examined the body.\N- He died? How?\N- Animal attack. Was it the same one that... got that security\Nguard down in Mason? Most likely. Well, it's getting\Ncloser to town, then. Bella, you should go inside. Waylon was your\Nfather's friend. Okay. I'll see you later. Hey.\N- Hey. Dad, I'm really sorry. I've known him\Ngoing on 30 years. Don't worry, we're\Ngonna find this thing. Meantime. I want you to carry\Nthis with you. I don't know if you... It'll give your old\Nman some peace of mind. Okay. Let's go home. Cold One. You're impossibly\Nfast and strong. Your skin is pale\Nwhite and ice-cold. Your eyes change color. And sometimes you speak... like you're from\Na different time. You never eat or\Ndrink anything. You don't go out\Nin the sunlight. How old are you? Seventeen. How long have you been 17? A while. I know what you are. Say it. Out loud. Say it. Vampire. Are you afraid? No. Then ask me the most\Nbasic question. What do we eat? You won't hurt me. Where are we going? Up the mountain. Out of the cloud bank. You need to see what\NI look like in the sunlight. This is why we don't show\Nourselves in sunlight. People would know\Nwe're different. This is what I am. It's like diamonds. You're beautiful. Beautiful? This is the skin of\Na killer, Bella. I'm a killer. I don't believe that. That's because you\Nbelieve the lie. It's camouflage. I'm the world's most\Ndangerous predator. Everything about\Nme invites you in, my voice, my face,\Neven my smell. As if I would\Nneed any of that. As if you could outrun me. As if you could fight me off. I'm designed to kill. I don't care. I've killed people before. It does not matter. I wanted to kill you. I've never wanted\Na human's blood... so much in my life. I trust you. Don't. I'm here. I trust you. My family, we're different from\Nothers of our kind. We only hunt animals. We've learned to\Ncontrol our thirst. But it's you, your scent, it's like a drug to me. You're like... my own personal\Nbrand of heroin. Why did you hate me\Nso much when we met? I did. Only for making me\Nwant you so badly. I still don't know if\NI can control myself. I know you can. I can't read your mind. You have to tell me\Nwhat you're thinking. Now I'm afraid. Good. I'm not afraid of you. I'm only afraid of losing you. I feel like you're\Ngonna disappear. You don't know how long\NI've waited for you. So the lion fell in\Nlove with the lamb. What a stupid lamb. What a sick, masochistic lion. About three things\NI was absolutely positive. First. Edward was a vampire. Second, there was a part of him, and I didn't know... how dominant that\Npart might be, that thirsted for my blood. And third. I was unconditionally\Nand irrevocably... in love with him. Monte Carlo?\NThat's our prom theme? Gambling, tuxedos,\Nand Bond, James Bond. Oh, my God. Wow. You know, everybody's staring. Not that guy. No,\Nhe just looked. I'm breaking all the\Nrules now anyway. Since I'm going to hell. So, does a person\Nhave to be dying... to become like you? No, that's just Carlisle. He'd never do this to someone\Nwho had another choice. So, how long have\Nyou been like this? Since 1918. That's when Carlisle found me\Ndying of Spanish influenza. What was it like? The venom was excruciating. But what Carlisle\Ndid was much harder. Not many of us have the\Nrestraint to do that. But didn't he just\Nhave to bite? Not exactly. When we taste... human blood, a sort\Nof frenzy begins, and it's almost\Nimpossible to stop. But Carlisle did. First with me\Nand then with his wife, Esme. So is Carlisle the real reason\Nthat you don't kill people? No, he's not the only reason. I don't want to be a monster. My family, we think of ourselves\Nas vegetarians, right, 'cause we only survive\Non the blood of animals. But it's... It's like a human\Nonly living on tofu. It keeps you strong, but you're never\Nfully satisfied. It wouldn't be like\Ndrinking your blood, for instance. Was it other vampires\Nthat killed Waylon? Yeah. There are others out there, and we run into them\Nfrom time to time. Can the rest of your family... read people's\Nminds like you can? No. That's just me. But Alice can see the future. I bet she saw me coming. Alice's visions\Nare subjective. I mean, the future\Ncan always change. Could you act human?\NI mean, I've got neighbors. I'm gonna take you to\Nmy place tomorrow. Thanks. Wait, like, with your family?\N- Yeah. What if they don't like me? So, you're worried not because... you'll be in a house\Nfull of vampires, but because you think\Nthey won't approve of you? I'm glad I amuse you. What is it? Complication. I'll pick you up tomorrow. Hey. Come to visit your truck? Looks good. Got that dent out. Yeah. Actually, we came to\Nvisit your flat-screen. First Mariners game\Nof the season. Plus Jacob here keeps\Nbugging me about... seeing you again. Great, Dad. Thanks. Just keeping it real, son. Vitamin R. Well done, Chief. Harry Clearwater's\Nhomemade fish fry. Good man. Any luck with\Nthat Waylon case? Well, I don't think\Nit was an animal... that killed him. Never thought it was. So spread the word\Nout at the rez, huh? Keep the kids\Nout of the woods. Will do. Don't want no one else\Ngetting hurt, do we? Whoa. This is incredible. It's so light and\Nopen, you know? What did you expect, coffins and\Ndungeons and moats? No, not the moats. Not the moats. This is the one place\Nwe don't have to hide. I told them not to do this. You add a little\Nbit of olive oil... to a non-stick sauté pan, and you want to cook... with the olive oil\Nin medium-high heat. What I do, I cut\Nthis in strips, and then we gonna cut this... Is she even Italian?\N- Her name is Bella. I'm sure she'll love\Nit, no matter what. Get a whiff of that. Here comes the human. Bella, we're making\NItaliano for you. Bella, this is Esme. My mother for all\Nintents and purposes. You've given us an excuse... to use the kitchen\Nfor the first time. I hope you're hungry. Yeah, absolutely.\N- She already ate. Perfect. Yeah, it's just because I know that you\Nguys don't eat... Of course. It's very\Nconsiderate of you. Just ignore Rosalie. I do.\N- Yeah. Let's just keep pretending... like this isn't\Ndangerous for all of us. I would never tell\Nanybody anything. She knows that. Yeah, well, the problem is, you two have gone\Npublic now, so... Emmett. No, she should know. The entire family... will be implicated\Nif this ends badly. Badly, as in... I would become the meal. Hi, Bella. I'm Alice. Hi.\N- Hi. You do smell good. Alice, what are you... It's okay. Bella and I are gonna\Nbe great friends. Sorry, Jasper's our\Nnewest vegetarian. It's a little\Ndifficult for him. It's a pleasure to meet you. It's okay, Jasper.\NYou won't hurt her. All right, I'm gonna take you... on a tour of the\Nrest of the house. Okay.\N- Well, I'll see you soon. Okay. Cute.\N- I know. I think that went well. Clean this up. Now. Was that as weird for\Nyou as it was for me? I don't know. Graduation caps? Yeah. It's a private joke. We matriculate a lot. That's kind of miserable. I mean, repeating high school\Nover and over. True, but the younger\Nwe start out... in a new place, the longer we can stay there. Come on. Yeah, this is my room. No bed? No, I don't... I don't sleep. Ever?\N- No, not at all. Okay. Boy, you have so much music. What are you listening to? It's Debussy. I don't know...\N- Yeah. Claire De Lune is great. What?\N- I can't dance. Well, I could always make you. I'm not scared of you. Well, you really\Nshouldn't have said that. You better hold on\Ntight, spider monkey. Do you trust me? In theory. Then close your eyes. What? This isn't real. This kind of stuff\Njust doesn't exist. It does in my world. Hold up. It's human. Arizona. Yo, what's happening? So you and Cullen, huh? That's... I don't like it. I mean, I don't know, he just looks at you\Nlike you're something to eat. Here's your veggie\Nplate, Stephenie. Hey, sorry I'm late.\NBiology project. I ordered you the\Nspinach salad. I hope that's okay. You should order one\Nfor yourself next time. Cut back on the steak. Hey, I'm as\Nhealthy as a horse. Say, Chief, boys want to know, did you find anything\Ndown by Queets River today? Yeah, we found a bare\Nhuman footprint, but it looks like\Nwhoever that is, is headed east, so Kitsap County\Nsheriff is gonna take... over from here. Okay.\N- Okay? I just hope they\Ncatch him fast. Looks like your friends\Nare flagging you. It's okay if you\Nwanna go join them. I'm just gonna turn\Nin early anyway. Me, too. Bella, it's Friday\Nnight. Go out. Looks like the Newton boy's\Ngot a big smile for you. Yeah, he's a good buddy. What about any of these\Nother yahoos in town? Anybody interest you? Dad, we gonna talk about boys? Yeah, I guess not. I just feel like I leave\Nyou alone too much. You should be around people. I don't really\Nmind being alone. I guess I'm kind of like\Nmy dad in that way. So, how's all the\Nbaseball stuff going? Phil's working so hard. You know, spring training. We're looking for\Na house to rent... in case things become\Nmore permanent. You'd like Jacksonville, baby. Yeah? I'm really liking Forks. What? Forks is growing on me. Could a guy have anything\Nto do with that? Well, yeah. I knew it. Tell me everything.\NWhat is he? Jock? Indie? I bet he's smart. Is he smart? Mom, can I talk to you later? Come on, we gotta talk boys.\NAre you being safe? How did you get in here? The window. Do you do that a lot? Well, just the past\Ncouple of months. I like watching you sleep. It's kind of\Nfascinating to me. I always want to\Ntry one thing. Just stay very still. Don't move. Stop it. I'm sorry. I'm stronger than I thought. Yeah. I wish I\Ncould say the same. I can't ever lose\Ncontrol with you. Hey, don't go. Hey, got you another one.\N- Thanks. I have a date with\NEdward Cullen. He's a little old\Nfor you, isn't he? No. He's a junior. I'm a junior. I thought you\Nliked the Cullens. I thought you didn't like\Nany of the boys in town. Edward doesn't live in town. Technically. He's right outside. He is? Yeah, he wanted to\Nmeet you, officially. All right. Bring him in. Could you be nice? He's important. Chief Swan. I want to formally\Nintroduce myself. I'm Edward Cullen. Hi, Edward. Bella won't be out\Ntoo late tonight. She's just gonna play baseball\Nwith my family. Baseball? Yes, sir, that's the plan. Bella's gonna play baseball. Well, good luck with that. I'll take good care\Nof her. I promise. Hey. Still got that pepper spray? Yeah, Dad. And since when do\Nvampires like baseball? Well, it's the\NAmerican pastime, and there's a\Nthunderstorm coming. It's the only\Ntime we can play. You'll see why. Hey. Glad you're here.\NWe need an umpire. She thinks we cheat. I know you cheat. Call them as you\Nsee them, Bella. Okay. It's time. Okay, now I see why\Nyou need the thunder. That's gotta be a\Nhome run, right? Edward's very fast. Ooh, baby,\Ndon't you know I suffer? Ooh, baby, I'm a fool for you Come home, Rosalie. You're out.\N- Out. Babe, come on.\NIt's just a game. You set my soul alight Nice kitty. Ooh You set my soul alight Ooh You set my soul alight Ooh You set my soul alight What are you doing? Super massive black hole My monkey man. Stop. They were leaving.\NThen they heard us. Let's go.\N- It's too late. Get your hair down. Like that'll help. I can smell her from\Nacross the field. I shouldn't have\Nbrought you here. I'm so sorry. What? What are you... Just be quiet and\Nstand behind me. I believe this belongs to you. Thank you. I am Laurent. And this is Victoria... and James. I'm Carlisle. This\Nis my family. Hello. I'm afraid your\Nhunting activities... have caused something\Nof a mess for us. Our apologies. We didn't realize\Nthe territory... had been claimed. Yes, well, we maintain\Na permanent residence nearby. Really? Well, we won't be\Na problem anymore. We were just passing through. The humans were tracking us,\Nbut we led them east. You should be safe. Excellent. So, could you use\Nthree more players? Come on. Just one game. Sure. Why not? A few of us were leaving.\NYou could take their place. We'll bat first. I'm the one with the\Nwicked curveball. Well, I think we\Ncan handle that. We shall see. You brought a snack. A human? The girl is with us. I think it best if you leave. I can see the game is over. We'll go now. James. Get Bella out of here. Go. Okay, I've got it. I've\Ngot it. I'm all right. What, now he's\Ncoming after me? Listen to me.\NJames is a tracker. The hunt is his obsession. I read his mind. My reaction on the\Nfield set him off. I just made this his\Nmost exciting game ever. He's never gonna stop.\N- What should we do? We have to kill him. Rip him apart and\Nburn the pieces. Where we going?\N- Away from Forks. We'll get a ferry\Nto Vancouver. I have to go home. Now. You have to take me home.\N- You can't go home. He's just gonna trace\Nyour scent there. It's the first place\Nhe's gonna look. But my dad is there. We...\N- It doesn't matter. Yes, it does. He could get killed\Nbecause of us. Just let me get you\Nout of here first, all right? It's my dad. We\Nhave to go back. We'll figure a way... to lead the tracker\Naway somehow. I don't know. But we\Nhave to do something. Edward, I said leave me alone. Bella, don't do this, please. It's over. Get out. Hey, hey, hey, hey. Bella? What's going on? I just gotta get out of\Nhere. I'm leaving now. Hey. Bella? What am I gonna say to him? I can't hurt him. Bella, what's going on?\N- You just have to. I'll be down at the truck. Did he hurt you? No. Break up with\Nyou or something? No, I broke up with him. I thought you liked him. Yeah, that's why\NI have to leave. I don't want this.\NI have to go home. Home? Your... Your mom's not\Neven in Phoenix. She'll come home.\NI'll call her from the road. You're not gonna\Ndrive home right now. You can sleep on it. If you still feel like\Ngoing in the morning. I'll take you to the airport.\N- No. I want to drive. It'll give me more\Ntime to think. I mean, if I get really tired, I'll pull into a\Nmotel. I promise. Look, Bella, I know I'm not\Nthat much fun to be around, but I can change that.\NWe can do more stuff together. Like what? Like watch baseball\Non the flat-screen? Eat at the diner every night?\NSteak and cobbler? Dad, that's you.\NThat's not me. Bella, come on, I just... I just got you back. Yeah, and, you know, if\NI don't get out now, then I'm just gonna be\Nstuck here like Mom. Your father's\Ngonna forgive you. Why don't you let me drive? He won't. You should've seen his face. I told him the same thing\Nthat my mom told him... when she was leaving him. It's the only way\Nhe'd let you go. Just don't worry\Nabout him now. He's safe. The\Ntracker's following us. Oh, God.\N- It's just Emmett. Alice is in the car behind us. Wait. He came to warn\Nus about James. This isn't my fight, and I've grown\Ntired of his games, but he's got\Nunparalleled senses, absolutely lethal. I've never seen\Nanything like him... in my 300 years. And the woman, Victoria,\Ndon't underestimate her. I've had to fight\Nour kind before. They're not easy to kill.\N- But not impossible. We'll tear them apart\Nand burn the pieces. I don't relish the thought\Nof killing another creature, even a sadistic\None like James. What if he kills\None of us first? I'm gonna run Bella south. Can you lead the\Ntracker away from here? No, Edward. James knows you would\Nnever leave Bella. He'll follow you.\N- I'll go with Bella. Jasper and I will\Ndrive her south. I'll keep her safe, Edward. Can you keep your\Nthoughts to yourself? Yes. Rosalie, Esme, could you put these on... so the tracker will\Npick up Bella's scent? Why? What is she to me? Rosalie, Bella is with Edward. She's part of this family now, and we protect our family. Oh, God. If anything... What if... If anything happens,\NI swear to God... Nothing's gonna happen. There's seven of us,\Nand there's two of them, and when everything's done, I'm gonna come\Nback and get you. Yeah. Bella, you are my life now. Hey, Mom. It's me again. You must have let\Nyour phone die... or something. I'm not in Forks, but\Neverything's okay, and I'll explain it later. Rosalie, mark the tree. That's good. What is it? What do you see? He's figured it out. The tracker, he just\Nchanged course. Where will it take him, Alice?\N- Mirrors. A room full of mirrors. Edward said the visions\Nweren't always certain. She sees the course people\Nare on while they're on it. If they change their minds,\Nthe vision changes. Okay, so the course that\Nthe tracker's on now... is gonna lead him\Nto a ballet studio? You've been here?\N- I took lessons as a kid. The school I went to\Nhad an arch just like that. Was your school\Nhere in Phoenix? Yeah. Edward, are you okay?\N- We've lost the tracker. The woman's still in the area. Rosalie and Esme\Nare going back... to Forks to protect\Nyour father. I'm coming to get you.\NThen you and I... are gonna go somewhere alone. And the others\Nwill keep hunting. I'll do whatever it takes\Nto make you safe again. Hey, Mom, I'm glad\Nyou got my message. What are you doing home? Bella? Bella? Bella,\Nwhere are you? Calm down, everything's fine.\N- Bella? Bella? I'll explain everything later. Mom, are you there? Forks High School\Ndoesn't protect... its students'\Nprivacy very well. It was just too easy\Nfor Victoria... to find your previous address. It's a nice house\Nyou have here. I was prepared\Nto wait for you, but then Mom came home\Nafter she received... a very worried call\Nfrom your dad, and it all worked\Nout quite well. Wait, wait... Don't touch her. Don't... You can still save her.\N- Don't. But you're gonna\Nhave to get away... from your friends. Can you handle that?\N- Where should I meet you? How about your\Nold ballet studio? And I'll know if you\Nbring anyone along. Poor Mommy would... pay the price\Nfor that mistake. I'd never given much thought\Nto how I would die. But dying in the place\Nof someone I love... seems like a good way to go. I can't bring myself to\Nregret the decisions... that brought me\Nface-to-face with death. They also brought\Nme to Edward. Bella? Bella? Bella,\Nwhere are you? Mom?\N- Bella? Mom?\N- There you are. What are you doing in here? Everyone makes fun of me. Come on, you're a\Nwonderful dancer. Mom, I suck. You do not suck. That's my favorite part. You were a stubborn\Nchild, weren't you? She's not even here.\N- No. Sorry. You know, but you really\Nmade it too easy. So to make things\Nmore entertaining. I'm gonna make a little film\Nof our time together. I borrowed this\Nfrom your house. I hope you don't mind. Good. And... action. That'll break Edward's\Nlittle heart. You have... Edward has nothing\Nto do with this. But he does. His rage will make for\Nmore interesting sport... than his feeble\Nattempt to protect you. And let's continue. Beautiful. Very\Nvisually dynamic. I chose my stage well. It's too bad he didn't have\Nthe strength to turn you. Instead, he kept you\Nthis fragile little human. It's cruel, really. Tell Edward how much it hurts. Tell him to avenge\Nyou. Tell him. No, Edward, don't.\N- Tell him. Tell him. You're alone... 'cause you're faster\Nthan the others. But not stronger. I'm strong enough to kill you. I'm sorry. Bella, Bella, it's okay. Son. Enough. Remember who you are. Bella, you're okay. Bella needs you. It's okay. Oh, God. Carlisle? Her blood. Your brothers will\Ntake care of him. I got him. Carlisle.\N- Start the fire. Get the floorboards. Alice.\N- Alice, go. Her femoral artery's\Nbeen severed. She's losing too much blood. No, no, my head is burning. It's the venom. You have to make a choice. You could let the\Nchange happen. No. It's gonna happen,\NEdward. I've seen it. It doesn't have\Nto be that way. She's still hemorrhaging. Alice, make me a\Ntourniquet. Your belt. Carlisle, what's\Nmy other option? Tie it above my hands. Carlisle. Go. We could try to\Nsuck the venom out. You know I won't\Nbe able to stop. Then find the will to stop. But choose. She only has minutes left. I'm gonna make it\Ngo away, Bella. I'm gonna make it go away. Edward, stop. Her blood is clean.\NYou're killing her. Edward. Stop. Stop. Find the will. Death is peaceful, easy. Life is harder. Bella? Baby? Bella. Mom?\N- Hey. Where is he? Where's... Where's Edward? He's asleep. He never leaves. And your dad, he's\Ndown at the cafeteria. What happened? Well, when you fell,\Nyou broke your leg, and you lost a lot of blood. You don't remember\Nany of this, do you? Edward came down\Nwith his dad... to try to convince you\Nto come back to Forks. So you went over\Nto their hotel, then you tripped, and you fell down two\Nflights of stairs. Went through a window. Yeah, that sounds like me. Oh, honey, I'm so sorry. It's Phil. He's so worried about you. You're texting. Finally, yeah. I told him to stay\Ndown in Florida. Honey, you are gonna\Nlove Jacksonville. It's sunny every day, and we found the\Ncutest little house, and you've got\Nyour own bathroom. Mom, I still want\Nto live in Forks. What? I want to live in Forks. Well, okay, but\Nwe'll talk about it. Do you mind getting Dad? I have to talk to\Nhim. Apologize. Okay, baby. I'll go get him. And I'll go get a nurse, okay?\N- Okay. So what happened? Where's James? We took care of it. And the woman,\NVictoria, she ran off. I'm alive because of you. No, you're in here\Nbecause of me. The worst part of it was that I thought I wasn't\Ngonna be able to stop. You did stop. Bella, you gotta go\Nto Jacksonville... so I can't hurt you anymore. What? Are you... No. No. I don't even know\Nwhat you're... How... What are you talking about? You want me to go\Naway? I can't... No, I can't... I can't\Njust leave you... I know. We can't be apart. You can't leave me. I'm here. Okay, just don't... You just can't say stuff\Nlike that to me. Ever. Where else am I gonna go? Alice lent me the dress. The cast is... You're perfect. I'll take care of\Nher, Chief Swan. I've heard that before. All right, Bells. I put a new can of pepper\Nspray in your bag. Dad. And... Well, you look beautiful. Thanks. See you. Hey. I'll be right back. Bella.\N- Jacob. Hey. Nice.\N- You, too. Are you crashing the\Nprom or something? Did you come with a date? No. My dad paid me to\Ncome talk to you. Twenty bucks. Let's hear it. Just don't get mad, okay? He wants you to break up\Nwith your boyfriend. It's just, he said, quote, 'We'll be watching you. ' Okay, well, tell\Nhim, 'Thanks. ' Okay. And to pay up.\N- Okay. Let me help you. Jacob. I'll take it from here. Guess I'll see\Nyou around, Bella. All right. I leave you alone\Nfor two minutes, and the wolves descend. I can't believe you're\Nmaking me do this. Just smile. Tonight. Lightning Strikes. Don't go stay tonight. Wow. You are really\Ntrying to kill me. The prom is an important\Nrite of passage. I didn't want you\Nto miss anything. Oh. Everyday we're\Ngoing all the way Everyday, everyday, everyday\Nwe're going all the way Tonight. Lightning Strikes. Bella, hey. Do you want to go?\N- Yeah. All right, slowing it down. Shall we? You're serious? Why not. Wide on my plastic toys Then when the cops\Nclosed the fair I cut my long baby hair Stole me a dog-eared map See, you're dancing. At prom. Have I found you Flightless bird Jealous Weeping Edward, why did you save me? If you just let\Nthe venom spread. I could be like you by now. You don't know what\Nyou're saying. You don't want this.\N- I want you. Always. I'm not gonna end\Nyour life for you. I'm dying already. Every second, I get closer. Older. That's the way it's\Nsupposed to be. Alice said that she\Nsaw me like you. I heard her.\N- Her visions change. Yeah, based on what\Npeople decide. I've decided. So that's what\Nyou dream about. Becoming a monster. I dream about being\Nwith you forever. Forever? And you're ready right now? Yes. Bleeding or lost you American mouth Big pill Is it not enough... just to have a long\Nand happy life with me? Yeah. For now. No one will surrender tonight, but I won't give in. I know what I want. Have I found you Flightless bird Grounded Bleeding or lost you American mouth...

Did the cat get your tongue Did your string come undone One by one It comes to us all It's as soft as your pillow... I dreamed I was missing You were so scared But no one would listen... 'Cause no one else cared After my dreaming I woke with this fear What am I leaving When I'm done here? So if you're asking me I want you to know When my time comes Forget the wrong\Nthat I've done Help me leave behind some Reasons to be missed Don't resent me And when you're feeling empty Keep me in your memory Leave out all the rest Forgetting all the hurt inside You've learned to hide so well Pretending someone\Nelse can come And save me from myself I can't be who you are When my time comes Forget the wrong\Nthat I've done Help me leave behind some Reasons to be missed Don't resent me And when you're feeling empty Keep me in your memory Leave out all the rest Forgetting all the hurt inside You've learned to hide so well Pretending someone\Nelse can come And save me from myself I can't be who you are I can't be who you are...
