Well, I've read about\Nthis German fellow, Lilienthal, I believe,\Nwho's developed a glider that can take\Na man in the air, sir. Isn't that amazing? I mean, if you were\Nto apply that to this business, it would be revolutionary. Gentlemen!\NCan I have your attention? You're all dismissed. Bankrupt? I thought the company\Nhad a dozen trading ships. Yes, at the bottom\Nof the South China Sea. Typhoon sank 'em all. - Tag, you're it!\N- Oh, you're in for it! Hey. Oh, God! You're home early. And until further notice. Well, I didn't think\Nyou were long for that job. Or any job, apparently. That's what makes our life\Ntogether so exciting. Charity. This isn't the life\NI promised you.

This extraordinary machine\Nwas originally created by Leonardo da Vinci,\N400 years ago. But the blueprints had been\Nlost for centuries until just last week,\Non a stormy night, when a sunken pirate ship\Nwashed up on the shores of Nantucket. They found skeletons\Nand treasures and the blueprints\Nwere recovered by none other\Nthan J. W. Mercantile. The blueprints crossed my desk\Nvery briefly but I managed\Nto commit them to memory. And if I have\Nremembered correctly... Happy birthday, Caroline. This is a wishing machine. You tell it your wishes... and it keeps them safe\Nuntil they come true. Even if you forget them,\Nthey're always there. Can I tell a wish? Step right up. Go ahead. I wish to marry Santa Claus. That is a good wish. I wish for ballet slippers. Hey, that's a good wish, too.

This bank only wants\Nto lend money to people with money. What are you\Nlooking at, flop-doodle? Mr. Barnum. This venture you propose\Nis risky and somewhat bizarre. It's a good bet\Nis what it is, sir. People don't\Nwant to admit it... but they're fascinated\Nwith the exotic and the macabre. It's why we stare at it. The bank is going to need\Nsubstantial collateral. Of course. I, uh,\NI wouldn't suggest otherwise. The deed and title\Nto my entire flotilla of trading vessels. Why would a bank\Nloan us $10,000? Because we put up collateral. But, dear, we don't\Nhave any collateral. Sure we do. In the South China Seas. In the South China Seas? Deep in the South China Seas. And what did\Nwe buy with this loan? "Barnum's American Museum\Nof Curiosities." What kind of museum is it? A place to be transported. A place where people\Ncan see things they've never seen before. Huh? - Wax figures?\N- Yeah. Yeah. They're all the rage\Nin Europe. Look. Marie Antoinette with the\Nsore throat. Napoleon. Come here. See? You've already met some of the\Nmost famous folks in history. But they're not all wax. This is the great O'Malley. Master of sleight of hand.\NA king of deception. You don't look like a magician. I'm a thief. A very good thief. I caught him nicking my watch. - See?\N- An elephant! Not just any elephant. I can get you\Nsomethin' real nice. Just say the word. Thank you. Oh, yeah.\NThis is a ten-ton bull straight from\Nthe plains of Africa. And look at that. The tallest giraffe\Nin the world. Can I climb up its leg? Absolutely not. Okay. Now, I know how it looks. If you didn't,\NI'd be worried. I mean, it just\Nneeds a little work, but... The loan has to be\Npaid back every month. Oh, yeah, we're gonna pay it.\NWe just need customers. - Hundreds of them.\N- We're gonna get them. Welcome to the Barnum Museum. It is one hour\Nof your time, sir, but it will change your life. We have shows\Non the hour every hour. I love your dress. Surely not for\Nthe faint of heart, but I can tell\Nyou're gonna love it. Half price for anyone\Nwho's wearing a hat. Ho, ho! That's you, sir. Welcome to the Barnum Museum. Load of garbage. Goodness, no. It's rubbish. Welcome to the Barnum Museum,\Nwhere everyone's special... How many tickets? - Three.\N- Three. Daddy. Daddy. Did you sell\Nany more tickets today? A few. Yeah. Most everyone was rushing home,\Nit's Friday, but we sold a few. I think you have too many dead\Nthings in your museum, Daddy. Do you? She's right.\NYou need something alive. Go to sleep, both of you. Something sensational. That's a big word. It's your word. Something that isn't stuffed. - Like a mermaid.\N- Or a unicorn. Unicorns aren't real. Well, mermaids\Naren't real either. You must be Gertrude Stratton. I'm looking for your son. I don't have a son. The hospital record says you do. Charles, right? Age 22? Charles! Charles! P.T. Barnum, at your service. I am putting together a show and I need a star. You want people\Nto laugh at me. Well, they're laughing\Nanyway, kid, so might as well get paid. I see a soldier,\Nno, a general riding across the stage\Nwith a sword and a gun, and... and... and the most beautiful uniform\Never made. People will come\Nfrom all over the world, and when they see him,\Nthey won't laugh. They'll salute. How's it looking, girls? Hey! You looking for freaks? I know where\Nyou can find one of them. Really? Come on, girls. Hello. Sir, you shouldn't\Nbe here. I'm sorry,\Nwho's doing that singing? It's you, isn't it? Sir, I'll have\Nto ask you to leave. You are so talented, blessed... Extraordinary. Unique. I would even say beautiful. Sir. Please leave me alone. They don't understand,\Nbut they will. This line is so... Oh, my God! Oh, goodness. Okay. Anne and W.D. Wheeler.\NBrother and sister? - Yes, sir.\N- Terrific. And what do you do? Trapeze. Trapeze. Okay. You know, people\Naren't gonna like it if you put us on the stage. Oh, I'm counting on it. Is this over your... Entire body. Terrific.\NI don't need to see it. Now. Yes! Can I just ask\Nhow heavy you are? Do you have a number for that? - I prefer not to say, but...\N- Just between you and me. 500 pounds. - 750 pounds, you said?\N- 750 pounds, it is! What is your name? Vasily Palvos, sir. Yeah, we're gonna\Nchange that name. Uh, I think you're Irish. We have a show! That's good,\Nbut I need it five times bigger! And I want it everywhere!

Tell me, Mr. Barnum, does it bother you that everything\Nyou're selling is fake? Do these smiles seem fake? It doesn't matter\Nwhere they come from. The joy is real. So, you are a philanthropist? Well, hyperbole\Nisn't the worst crime. Men suffer more from imagining\Ntoo little than too much. The creed of a true fraud. Mr. Bennett, when was\Nthe last time you smiled or had a good laugh?\NLike a real laugh? A theater critic who can't\Nfind joy in the theater. Now who's a fraud? Oh, Mr. Bennett. That word you used\Nto describe my show? Has a nice ring to it. And right this way. Don't you think there's enough\Nblind trust in my life? Well, isn't that\Nwhat makes it fun? Keep coming. Okay.\NAre you ready? - Is it?\N- It is. Come on. Let's go. Push. Wow. Helen, that's for you. And Caroline,\Nthis is for you. There's a ballet school\Nright down the street. Just past your\Nparents' house, actually. Don't tell me\Nyou bought this house just to rub my parents' noses\Nin your success? Well, that wasn't\Nthe only reason. This is the life I promised you. Shall we? Phin, it's beautiful, but you know, we don't\Nneed all of this to be... It only took me 25 years, but welcome home,\NCharity Barnum. - Hello, there.\N- There goes Barnum. Hey, sweetheart,\Nwho's that young man over there? Oh, that's Phillip Carlyle. A bit of a scandal, they say. His last play\Nwas a hit in London. Play? You pay good money to watch people stand around\Nand talk for two hours and they call me a con man. Ew, what's that smell?\NDo you smell that? Ew. Something does smell. Oh, I know what it is.\NPeanuts. I can see it right now. "Youngest prima ballerina in the history\Nof the City Ballet." I'm quitting. What? Why would you quit? I started too late.\NI'll never catch up. Caroline, you were the best\Ndancer on that stage. What? You think\NI can't spot talent? Ballet takes years\Nof hard work. It's not like the circus. You can't just fake it. She can't quit. No. No, I mean, she just... She just feels out of place\Nwith the other girls. Well, I should\Ncertainly hope so. I've never seen so many\Nlittle prima donnas in my life. Yeah, but those prima donnas\Nare the most important thing in the world to her right now. She'll learn to ignore them\Njust like I did. She shouldn't have to. New York society\Nwill never accept us. If they did,\Nthey'd have to stop judging and actually do something\Nwith their lives. This isn't about me. Oh. So it's different\Nthan everything else then? I just want her to be proud\Nof who she is, of her family. She is proud. We don't have\Nto be the Carlyles. Mr. Carlyle.\NYou produced this play? Yes, I did indeed. Refunds are available\Nat the front box office. P.T. Barnum. From the circus? Yes. You... you've been? God, no. But I have\Nseen the crowds. People leave your shows a great deal\Nhappier than when they came in. Which is much more\Nthan I can say for my play. And yet, you have\Nno trouble selling tickets. That's because\NI'm selling virtue. Can I buy you a drink? I wanna go after\Nthe carriage trade. Present legitimate acts, expand our appeal,\Ngo after the snobs. If you only knew\Nhow suffocating they are. So come join the circus. You clearly have a flair\Nfor show business. Teach me how to appeal\Nto the highbrows. - Are you serious?\N- Mm-hmm. Mr. Barnum, I can't just run off\Nand join the circus. Why not?\NSounds thrilling, doesn't it? Let's just say that I find it\Nmuch more comfortable admiring your show from afar. Comfort, the enemy of progress. Do you understand that\Njust associating with you could cost me my inheritance? Oh, it could cost you\Nmore than that. You'd be risking everything.

And what is your act,\NMr. Carlyle? I don't have an act. Everyone's got an act. Mr. Barnum! Yeah. You better come see this. Phillip, keep up! A bit of a nasty element. There always is, isn't there? Nothing draws a crowd\Nquite like a crowd. We don't want you in our city! Go home, you freaks! Freaks! "Shame of the city." "The protests cement\NMr. Barnum's reputation as a purveyor of the offensive\Nand indecent." "Offensive and indecent."\NMr. Bennett, I am blushing. No, I'm blushing. What do you care\Nwhat Bennett thinks? - He's a prig.\N- And a snob. Yeah, and all the snobs\Nin New York read him. He does their thinking for them. Whatever happened to\Nthriving off controversy? Yeah, well...\NHey. - Do you have any thoughts on this?\N- Phillip! You know what?\NAs a matter of fact, I do. Helen, come on. "The Master of the Household "has it in command\Nof the Queen "to invite\NMr. Phineas T. Barnum "and his theatrical troupe to a reception\Nat Buckingham Palace." The Queen Victoria?\NIs this real? I had to pull a few strings. If you want society\Nto accept you, you may as well start... at the very, very top. Are we all invited? I guess I'll just\Nhave to tell the Queen that either all of us go... or none of us will. The Queen of England!\NCan't get much better than that. Why aren't we in tails? We're the entertainment. Don't see you in a costume. Your Majesty,\NMr. Phineas T. Barnum... and his Oddities from America! Is that real? Your Majesty.\NMay I present Mr. Barnum. The honor is mine, Mr. Barnum. And I've heard all about your little colonel from\Nmy friends in America. General, ma'am. You're even smaller\Nthan I imagined. Well, you're not exactly reaching the top shelf\Nyourself, sweetheart. That went well. Your Majesty. Phillip. Miss Jenny Lind. She is luminous. Who's that? The opera singer? Singer, huh? She's the most famous performer\Nin all of Europe. She's sold out\NLa Scala a dozen times. Not to mention\Nthe French Opera. Ah. What are you doing? Following you, so you can\Nintroduce me to Miss Lind. - Introduce you? I don't know her.\N- Yeah. Everybody knows her.\NYou just said so yourself. Yeah, exactly. You don't just\Nmarch up to someone like this. Why not? We're personable.\NShe's a person. Miss Lind. My name is Phillip Carlyle. And this extraordinary gentleman\Nnext to me... Phineas Taylor Barnum. The pleasure's mine. Of course,\Nyou are the American. I believe I might\Nhave heard of you. Oh, well, if you've heard of me\Nall the way over here I must be doing something right. That, or something very wrong. Well, in the world of publicity,\Nthere's hardly a difference. I believe those are the words\Nof a scoundrel, Mr. Barnum. A showman, Miss Lind,\Njust a showman. The best on my side\Nof the Atlantic. Well, if you do\Nsay so yourself. I do, but I don't have to. - Oh, no. No.\N- Right? No, he is one of the best. Oh, that's very kind of you.\NMiss Lind... let me get to the point. I'd like to bring you\Nto New York. And if you agree, I'll make you\Nthe most famous singer not in Europe,\Nbut in the entire world. Mmm. And have you heard me sing? Absolutely.\NNo. No, I haven't. But like mine,\Nyour reputation precedes you, and, well,\NI trust your reputation more than my own taste, so... I've never been to America. You will sing\Nin the grandest theater with the finest orchestra\Nin the greatest city on Earth. "Jenny Lind. "One night only." Or maybe two. And at 20 percent of the gate, it'll be a queen's ransom\Nfor your efforts. I give most of my earnings\Nto charity, Mr. Barnum. To orphans and widows. "Voice of a Nightingale,\NHeart of an Angel." That's brilliant. I mean, the press\Nwill go crazy for that story. That's not a story. May I ask you something,\NMr. Barnum? Anything. Why me? People come to my show for the pleasure\Nof being hoodwinked. Just once, I'd love to give them\Nsomething real. Miss Lind. Everyone is here.\NLook at this. Even the Winthrops. Are you happy? I will be if this works. Oh, God. I hope she can sing. What's taking her so long? They're still\Ntaking their seats. Speaking of which.\NYeah? Tom and Lettie, the others,\Nthey've just arrived. What? Where should I put 'em?\NYour box? That box? No, no, no,\Nthat's a bit visible. Visible? The acoustics are actually\Nbetter in the standing room. That's where they should be. Miss Lind's ready now. Okay. Thank you, thank God! This is so awesome. - Isn't it wonderful?\N- Yeah. - I love it.\N- Look at the curtain. Ladies and gentlemen,\Nthank you for your patience. He's out of his element. What is this about? Is that Barnum? This isn't the circus. I recently had the privilege of hearing the most\Ndivine voice I've ever heard. Suddenly,\Nhe's a connoisseur. Now, I know that\Nsounds like Barnum Humbug... but I have 100 bottles\Nof good champagne on ice that says this isn't just\Nanother sideshow novelty. May I present... the Swedish Nightingale...

And your father tells me\Nyou're a fan of the ballet. Yes, I'm studying ballet. Are you? - Of course, I am.\N- And, of course, she is. And what\Nabout you, Helen? You look like\Na princess, ma'am. I have to admit, Barnum...\Nshe is remarkable. Enough to bring joy to the most\Njoyless critic, isn't she? Mmm. And in the hands of a\Nreal purveyor of the arts, she could be something in this country. Shame,\Nshe's fallen in with you. You really are better\Non the page, Mr. Bennett, hard as that is to believe. - Mr. Barnum...\N- Yes. - I'd love to meet Miss Lind.\N- And you will meet Miss Lind. - Would you introduce us?\N- If you just give me a moment... - Phineas.\N- Yes. You've... done well. Thank you. Allow me to introduce you. Uh, excuse me, Jenny. I'd like you to meet\NCharity's parents. Mr. and Mrs. Hallett. Ah, pleasure. - How do you do? Very nice to meet you.\N- Good to meet you. - Mother.\N- Hello, dear. Are these... Yes, those are\Nyour granddaughters. Phineas, not here. Not here? You afraid I'm gonna\Nembarrass your parents in front of their fancy friends? I really don't think\NI have that power. An insignificant man like me who was clearly destined\Nto lead an insignificant life. All that fortune,\Nand still just the tailor's boy. Get out. Well, Phineas... I believe I told you\Nthat free champagne is a recipe for disaster. Charity. Now would everyone please\Nraise their glasses? Charity. To Mr. Barnum... who has shown\Nonce and for all... that a man's station\Nis limited only by his imagination. - To Barnum! To Barnum!\N- Thank you. To Mr. Barnum. Thank you. It's hard to understand\Nwealth and privilege when you're born into it. I sometimes don't feel\Nlike I belong here. You? I was born out of wedlock... and that brought\Nshame upon my family. And life always\Nmanages to remind me that I don't deserve\Na place in this world. And that leaves a hole that\Nno ovation can ever fill. - Mr. Phineas!\N- Guys... Lord, that lady can sing! I know. Think she likes a man\Nin uniform? I'm sure she does.\NOkay, what are you doing here? You got a show\Nin an hour, okay? That's enough time for us to have\Nat least three drinks, right? Come on, let's go. - No, no, no. Lettie!\N- What? It's very crowded in here, okay?\NAnd I can't have you mingling... Guys! Who's gonna pay admission if you're out there\Nfor all the world to see? - Okay? Have a great show.\N- Wait. Ladies and gentlemen, a toast!

Our gate is down, we have more\Nprotesters every day. You just need to get people\Nto come back. "If you haven't been\Nto the Barnum Museum lately, you haven't been\Nat the Barnum Museum."
