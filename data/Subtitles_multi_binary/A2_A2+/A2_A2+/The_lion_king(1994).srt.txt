You see, I... Well, I shall never be king. And you shall never see<br/>the light of another day. Adieu. Didn't your mother ever tell you<br/>not to play with your food? What do you want? I'm here to announce that King Mufasa's on his way, so you'd better have a good excuse for missing this morning's ceremony. Oh, look, Zazu.<br/>You've made me lose my lunch. You'll lose more than that<br/>when the king gets through with you. He's as mad as a hippo with a hernia. I quiver with fear! Now, Scar, don't look at me that way. Help! -Scar?<br/>-Mm-hmm? Drop him. Impeccable timing, Your Majesty. Why, if it isn't my big brother descending from on high<br/>to mingle with the commoners. Sarabi and I didn't see you<br/>at the presentation of Simba. That was today? I feel simply awful! Must've slipped my mind. Yes, well, as slippery as your mind is, as the king's brother,<br/>you should've been first in line! Well, I was first in line, until the little hairball was born. That hairball is my son and your future king. I shall practise my curtsy! Don't turn your back on me, Scar. Oh, no, Mufasa. Perhaps you shouldn't<br/>turn your back on me. Is that a challenge? Temper, temper. I wouldn't dream of challenging you. Pity. Why not? Well, as far as brains go,<br/>I got the lion's share. But when it comes to brute strength, I'm afraid I'm at the shallow end<br/>of the gene pool. There's one in every family, sire. Two in mine, actually, and they always manage to<br/>ruin special occasions. What am I going to do with him? He'd make a very handsome throw rug. Zazu! And just think,<br/>whenever he gets dirty, you could take him out and beat him. Hmm. Simba. Dad! Dad! Come on, dad, we gotta go! Wake up! -Uhh!<br/>-Sorry. Dad! Dad! Your son is awake. Before sunrise, he's your son. Dad! Come on, Dad. You promised. Okay, Okay.<br/>I'm up, I'm up. Yeah! MUFASA: Look, Simba. Everything the light<br/>touches is our kingdom. Wow. A king's time as ruler rises and falls like the sun. One day, Simba, the sun will set on my time here and will rise with you as the new king. -And this'll all be mine?<br/>-Everything. Everything the light touches. What about that shadowy place? That's beyond our borders. You must never go there, Simba. But I thought a king<br/>can do whatever he wants. Oh, there's more to being king than... getting your way all the time. -There's more?<br/>- Simba... Everything you see exists together<br/>in a delicate balance. As king, you need to<br/>understand that balance and respect all the creatures, from the crawling ant to the leaping antelope. But, Dad, don't we eat the antelope? Yes, Simba, but let me explain. When we die, our bodies<br/>become the grass, and the antelope eat the grass. And so we are all connected in the great circle of life. -Good morning, sire!<br/>-Good morning, Zazu. Checking in with the morning report. Fire away. Well! The buzz from the bees is that the leopards<br/>are in a bit of a spot. Really? What are you doing, son? Pouncing. Let an old pro show you how it's done. I told the elephants to forget it,<br/>but they can't... -Zazu, would you turn around?<br/>-Yes, sire. - The cheetahs are hard up, but...<br/>- Stay low to the ground. - Cheetahs never prosper...<br/>- Yeah, okay. Stay low to the ground, right? Yeah. -What going on?<br/>-A pouncing lesson. Very good. Pouncing. Pouncing?<br/>No, sire, you can't be serious... This is so humiliating. Try not to make a sound. What are you telling him, Mufasa? Mufasa? Simba? That's very good. -Zazu!<br/>-Yes! Sir! News from the underground. Now, this time... Sire! Hyenas in the Pride Lands! Zazu, take Simba home. Aw, dad, can't I come? No, son. Pah! I never get to go anywhere. Oh, young master, one day, you will be king. Then you can chase those slobbering, mangy,<br/>stupid poachers from dawn until dusk. Hey, Uncle Scar!<br/>Guess what? I despise guessing games. I'm gonna be King of Pride Rock. Oh, goody! My dad just showed me<br/>the whole kingdom, and I'm gonna rule it all! Yes. Well, forgive me<br/>for not leaping for joy. Bad back, you know. Hey, Uncle Scar. When I'm king,<br/>what'll that make you? A monkey's uncle. You're so weird. You have no idea. So, your father showed you<br/>the whole kingdom, did he? Everything. He didn't show you what's beyond<br/>that rise at the northern border? Well, no. He said I can't go there. And he's absolutely right. It's far too dangerous. Only the bravest lions go there. Well, I'm brave. What's out there? I'm sorry, Simba,<br/>I just can't tell you. Why not? Simba, Simba, I'm only looking out for the<br/>well-being of my favourite nephew. Yeah, right! I'm your only nephew. All the more reason<br/>for me to be protective. An elephant graveyard is no place<br/>for a young prince. Oops! An elephant what? Whoa! Oh, dear, I've said too much. Well, I suppose you'd have<br/>found out sooner or later, you being so clever and all. Just do me one favour. Promise me you'll never visit<br/>that dreadful place. No problem. There's a good lad. You run along now and have fun. And remember, it's our little secret. -Hey, Nala.<br/>-Hi, Simba. Come on. I just heard<br/>about this great place. Simba! I'm kind of<br/>in the middle of a bath. SARABI: And it's time for yours. Mom! Mom, you're messing up my mane! Okay, okay, I'm clean.<br/>Can we go now? So, where are we going? It better not be anyplace dumb. No, it's really cool. So, where is this really cool place? Oh. -Uh, around the water hole.<br/>-The water hole? What's so great about the water hole? I'll show you when we get there. Oh. Uh, mom, can I go with Simba? Hmm, what do you think, Sarabi? Well... BOTH: Please? It's all right with me. -Yeah!<br/>-All right! As long as Zazu goes with you. No, not Zazu. ZAZU: Step lively. The sooner we get to the water hole, the sooner we can leave. So, where are we really going? An elephant graveyard. Wow! Shh! Zazu. Right. So, how are we<br/>gonna ditch the dodo? Oh, just look at you two. Little seeds of romance<br/>blossoming in the savanna. Your parents will be thrilled, what with your being betrothed and all. Be-what? Betrothed. Intended. Affianced. Meaning... One day, you two are<br/>going to be married. -Yuck!<br/>-Eww! I can't marry her.<br/>She's my friend. Yeah, it'd be so weird. Sorry to bust your bubble, but you two turtle doves<br/>have no choice. It's a tradition going back generations. When I'm king,<br/>that'll be the first thing to go. -Not so long as I'm around.<br/>-Well, in that case, you're fired. Nice try, but only the king can do that. Well, he's the future king. Yeah, so you have to do what I tell you. Not yet, I don't. And with an attitude like that, I'm afraid you're shaping up to be<br/>a pretty pathetic king, indeed.

Simba? Nala! All right! It worked! -We lost him.<br/>-I am a genius. Hey, genius, it was my idea. Yeah, but I pulled it off. -With me!<br/>-Oh, yeah? -Pinned ya.<br/>-Hey, let me up! Pinned ya again. This is it. We made it. Whoa! NALA: It's really creepy. Yeah. Isn't it great? -We could get in big trouble.<br/>-I know! I wonder if its brains are still in there. There's only one way to know. Come on, let's go check it out. Wrong! The only checking out you<br/>will do will be to check out of here. Oh, man! We're way beyond the boundary<br/>of the Pride Lands. Look, banana beak is scared. It's Mr banana beak to you, fuzzy, and right now we are all<br/>in very real danger. Danger? Ha! I walk on the wild side. I laugh in the face of danger. Ha ha ha ha! Well, well, well, Banzai,<br/>what have we got here? I don't know, Shenzi. What do you think, Ed? Just what I was thinking. A trio of trespassers! And quite by accident,<br/>let me assure you. A simple navigational error. Whoa, whoa, wait, wait, wait. I know you.<br/>You're Mufasa's little stooge. I, madam, am the king's major-domo. And that would make you... The future king. Do you know what we do to kings<br/>who step out of their kingdom? Huh! You can't do anything to me. Technically, they can.<br/>We are on their land. But Zazu, you told me they're nothing but<br/>slobbering, mangy, stupid poachers. Ix-nay on the upid-stay. -Who are you callin' upid-stay?<br/>-My, my, my. Oh, look at the sun! -It's time to go!<br/>-What's the hurry? We'd love you to<br/>stick around for dinner. Yeah, we could have<br/>whatever's lion around! Wait, wait, wait, I got one, I got one! Make mine a cub sandwich!<br/>Whaddaya think? What, Ed? What is it? Hey, did we order this dinner to go? No, why? 'Cause there it goes! -Did we lose 'em?<br/>-I think so. Where's Zazu? The little major-domo bird hippety-hopped all the way<br/>to the birdie-boiler. Oh, no! Not the birdie-boiler! Aaaah! Hey, why don't you pick<br/>on somebody your own size? -Like you?<br/>-Oops. Boo! NALA: Simba! Here, kitty, kitty, kitty. That was it? Do it again. Come on. - Oh, please, please!<br/>- Uncle, uncle! Silence! -We're gonna shut up right now!<br/>-Calm down. We're really sorry. If you ever come near my son again... Oh, this is... This is your son? -Oh, your son.<br/>-Did you know that? No. Me? I didn't know...<br/>No, did you? -No, of course not.<br/>-No. Ed? Toodles. -Dad, I...<br/>-You deliberately disobeyed me. -Dad, I'm... I'm sorry.<br/>-Let's go home. I thought you were very brave. MUFASA: Zazu. - Yes, sire?<br/>- Take Nala home. I've got to teach my son a lesson. Come, Nala. Simba, good luck. Simba! Simba, I'm very disappointed in you. -I know.<br/>-You could've been killed. You deliberately disobeyed me, and what's worse,<br/>you put Nala in danger. I was just trying to be brave, like you. I'm only brave when I have to be. Simba, being brave doesn't mean you go<br/>looking for trouble. But you're not scared of anything. I was today. -You were?<br/>-Yes. I thought I might lose you. I guess even kings get scared, huh? Mm-hmm. -But you know what?<br/>-What? I think those hyenas<br/>were even scareder. 'Cause nobody messes with your dad. -Come here, you.<br/>-Oh, no! No! Aagh! Uhh! SIMBA: Come here! Gotcha! -Dad?<br/>-Hmm? We're pals, right? Right. And we'll always be together, right? Simba, let me tell you something<br/>that my father told me. Look at the stars. The great kings of the past look down on us from those stars. -Really?<br/>-Yes. So whenever you feel alone, just remember that those kings<br/>will always be there to guide you. And so will I. BANZAI: Man, that lousy Mufasa. I won't be able to sit for a week. It's not funny, Ed. Hey, shut up! Will you knock it off? Well, he started it. SHENZI: Look at you guys. No wonder we're dangling<br/>at the bottom of the food chain. Man, I hate dangling. Yeah? If it weren't for those lions, we'd be runnin' the joint. Man, I hate lions. -So pushy.<br/>-And hairy. -And stinky.<br/>-And, man, are they... BOTH: Ugly! Oh, surely we lions are not all that bad. -Oh.<br/>-Oh, Scar. It's just you. We were afraid it was<br/>somebody important. Yeah, you know, like Mufasa. -SHENZI: Yeah.<br/>-I see. -Now that's power!<br/>-Tell me about it. I just hear that name and I shudder. -Mufasa!<br/>-Ooh! Do it again. -Mufasa!<br/>-Ooooh! Mufasa! Mufasa! Mufasa! SHENZI: Ooh, it tingles me. I'm surrounded by idiots. Now, you, Scar,<br/>I mean, you're one of us. I mean, you're our pal. Charmed. Oh, I like that. He's not king,<br/>but he's still so proper. Yeah. Hey, did you<br/>bring us anything to eat, Scar, old buddy, old pal?<br/>Huh? Did ya, did ya, did ya? I don't think you really deserve this. I practically gift-wrapped<br/>those cubs for you, and you couldn't even dispose of them. Well, you know, it wasn't exactly<br/>like they was alone, Scar. Yeah.

Your father has<br/>a marvellous surprise for you. Ooh, what is it? If I told you, it wouldn't be<br/>a surprise now, would it? If you tell me,<br/>I'll still act surprised. Ho ho ho!<br/>You are such a naughty boy. Come on, Uncle Scar. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. This is just for you and your daddy. You know, a sort of father-son thing. Well, I'd better go get him. -I'll go with you.<br/>-No. No. Just stay on this rock. You wouldn't want to end up<br/>in another mess like you did with the hyenas. You know about that? Simba, everybody knows about that. -Really?<br/>-Oh, yes. Lucky daddy was there<br/>to save you, eh? Oh, and just between us, you might want to work on<br/>that little roar of yours, hmm? Oh. Okay. Hey, Uncle Scar,<br/>will I like this surprise? Simba, it's to die for. Shut up. I can't help it.<br/>I'm so hungry. I got to have a wildebeest. Stay put. Can't I just pick off<br/>one of the little sick ones? No. We wait for the signal from Scar. There he is. Let's go. "Little roar." Puh! Rarr! Rrrarr! Rarr! Oh, look, sire, the herd is on the move. -Odd.<br/>-Mufasa, quick. Stampede in the gorge. -Simba's down there!<br/>-Simba? Zazu, help me! Your father is on the way! Hold on! Hurry! There! There on that tree! Hold on, Simba! Dad! ZAZU: Oh, Scar, this is awful! What'll we do? What'll we do? I'll go back for help,<br/>that's what I'll do. Dad! MUFASA: Scar! -SCAR: Brother.<br/>-Brother, help me! Long live the king. No! Dad! Dad? Dad, come on. You got to get up. Dad? We got to go home. Help! Somebody! Anybody. Help. Simba. What have you done? There were wildebeests,<br/>and he tried to save me. It was an accident.<br/>I didn't mean for it to happen. Of course.<br/>Of course you didn't. No one ever means for<br/>these things to happen. But the king is dead. And if it weren't for you,<br/>he'd still be alive. Oh, what will your mother think? What am I going to do? Run away, Simba. Run. Run away and never return. Kill him. Whoa! Yow! Aah! Ohh! Yeow! Hey, there he goes.<br/>There he goes. So go get him. There ain't no way<br/>I'm going in there. What, you want me to come out<br/>looking like you, cactus butt? But we got to finish the job. Well, he's as good as<br/>dead out there anyway. And if he comes back, we'll kill him. Yeah! You hear that? If you ever come back, we'll kill you! Mufasa's death is a terrible tragedy. But to lose Simba,<br/>who had barely begun to live... For me, it is a deep, personal loss. So it is with a heavy heart<br/>that I assume the throne. Yet out of the ashes of this tragedy<br/>we shall rise to greet the dawning of a new era in which lion and hyena come together in a great and glorious future. Yaaaah! Get out! Get out!<br/>Get out of here! I love this! Bowling for buzzards. Hee hee hee!<br/>Gets 'em every time. Uh-oh.<br/>Hey, Timon, you better come look. I think it's still alive. Eeeuw. All righty, what have we got here? Jeez, it's a lion! Run, Pumbaa, move it! Hey, Timon, it's just a little lion. Look at him. He's so cute and all alone. -Can we keep him?<br/>-Pumbaa, are you nuts? You're talking about a lion. Lions eat guys like us. -But he's so little.<br/>-He's going to get bigger. Maybe he'll be on our side. That's the stupidest thing<br/>I ever heard. Maybe he'll... Hey, I've got it. What if he's on our side? You know, having a lion around<br/>might not be such a bad idea. So we're keeping him? Of course.<br/>Who's the brains of this outfit? -Uh...<br/>-My point exactly. Jeez, I'm fried. Let's get out of here<br/>and find some shade. -You okay, kid?<br/>-I guess so. You nearly died. I saved you. Well, Pumbaa helped. A little. Thanks for your help. Hey, where you going? Nowhere. Gee, he looks blue. I'd say brownish gold. No, no, no.<br/>I mean he's depressed. -Kid, what's eating you?<br/>-Nothing. He's at the top of the food chain. The food chain! Ahem. So, where you from? Who cares? I can't go back. Ah, you're an outcast. That's great. So are we. What'd you do, kid? Something terrible. But I don't want to talk about it. Good. We don't want to hear about it. Come on, Timon. Anything we can do? Not unless you can change the past. You know, kid, in times like this, my buddy Timon here says, "You got to put your<br/>behind in your past." No, no, no. -I mean...<br/>-Amateur. Lie down before you hurt yourself. It's,<br/>"You got to put your past behind you." Look, kid, bad things happen, and you can't do anything<br/>about it, right? -Right.<br/>-Wrong! When the world turns its back on you, you turn your back on the world. Well, that's not what I was taught. Then maybe you need a new lesson. Repeat after me. Ahem. -Hakuna matata.<br/>-What?

I only mentioned it<br/>to illustrate the differences in your royal managerial approaches. BANZAI: Hey, boss. Oh, what is it this time? We got a bone to pick with you. I'll handle this. Scar, there's no food, no water. Yeah. It's dinner time and we ain't got no stinking entrées. It's the lionesses' job to do the hunting. Yeah, but they won't go hunt. Oh... Eat Zazu. Oh, you wouldn't want me. I'd be so tough and gamey and... Oh, Zazu, don't be ridiculous.<br/>All you need is a little garlic.

Pumbaa, I don't wonder, I know. Oh? What are they? They're fireflies. Fireflies that got stuck<br/>up in that big bluish-black thing. Oh, gee. I always thought they were balls of gas burning billions of miles away. Pumbaa, with you, everything's gas. Simba, what do you think? Well, I don't know. Oh, come on.<br/>Give, give, give, give. Come on. We told you ours. - Please?<br/>- Well... Somebody once told me that the great kings of the past<br/>are up there watching over us. Really? You mean a bunch of royal dead guys<br/>are watching us? Pfff! Who told you something like that? Yeah, yeah. -What mook made that up?<br/>-Yeah. Pretty dumb, huh? -Aw, you're killing me.<br/>-Yeah. Was it something I said? Hmm. Hmm. Simba? He's... He's alive?<br/>He's alive!

Don't worry, buddy. I'm here for you. Everything's going to be okay. Get her! Bite her head! Go for the jugular! The jugular! See, I told you he'd come in handy. Nala? Is it really you? Who are you? It's me. Simba. Simba? Whoa! How did you... -Wow!<br/>-Where did you come from? This is gr... It's great to see you! Hey, what's goin' on here? What are you doing here?

Nala, this is Pumbaa. Pumbaa, Nala. -Pleased to make your acquaintance.<br/>-The pleasure is all mine. How do you... Whoa, whoa! Time out!<br/>Let me get this straight. You know her, she knows you. But she wants to eat him, and everybody's okay with this? -Did I miss something?<br/>-Relax, Timon. Wait till everyone finds out<br/>you've been here all this time. And your mother, what will she think? She doesn't have to know.<br/>Nobody has to know. Of course they do.<br/>Everyone thinks you're dead. They do? Yeah. Scar told us about the stampede. He did? What else did he tell you? What else matters? You're alive. And that means, you're the king. King? Lady, have you got<br/>your lions crossed! King? Your Majesty, I gravel at your feet.<br/>Mwah! Mwah! Mwah! Stop it. It's not gravel, it's grovel. And don't! He's not the king. Are you? -No.<br/>-Simba! No, I'm not the king.<br/>Maybe I was gonna be, but that was a long time ago. Let me get this straight. You're the king?<br/>And you never told us? -Look, I'm still the same guy.<br/>-But with power. Could you guys excuse us<br/>for a few minutes? Hey, whatever she has to say, she can say in front of us, right, Simba? Mm... Maybe you'd better go. It starts.<br/>You think you know a guy. Timon and Pumbaa,<br/>you learn to love 'em. What? What is it? It's like you're back from the dead. You don't know how much<br/>this will mean to everyone. What it means to me. -Hey, it's okay.<br/>-I've really missed you. I've missed you, too. I tell you, Pumbaa.<br/>This stinks. Oh, sorry. Not you! Them! Him, her, alone.

It is beautiful. But I don't understand something. You've been alive all this time. Why didn't you<br/>come back to Pride Rock? Well, I just needed<br/>to get out on my own, live my own life. And I did, and it's great. We've really needed you at home. No one needs me. Yes, we do. You're the king. Nala, we've been through this.<br/>I'm not the king. Scar is. Simba, he let the hyenas<br/>take over the Pride Lands. -What?<br/>-Everything's destroyed. There's no food, no water. Simba, if you don't do something soon, everyone will starve. -I can't go back.<br/>-Why? -You wouldn't understand.<br/>-What? No, no, no. It doesn't matter. Hakuna matata. -What?<br/>-Hakuna matata. It's something I learned out here. Sometimes bad things happen... Simba... ...and there's nothing you can do<br/>about it. So why worry? Because it's your responsibility. Well, what about you?<br/>You left. I left to find help, and I found you. Don't you understand? You're our only hope. -Sorry.<br/>-What's happened to you? You're not the Simba I remember. You're right. I'm not. -Now are you satisfied?<br/>-No. Just disappointed. You know, you're starting<br/>to sound like my father. Good. At least one of us does. You think you can just show up<br/>and tell me how to live my life? You don't even know<br/>what I've been through. I would if you'd just tell me. -Forget it!<br/>-Fine! She's wrong. I can't go back. What would it prove, anyway?<br/>It won't change anything. You can't change the past. You said you'd always be there for me! But you're not. And it's because of me. It's my fault. It's my fault. <i>♪ Asante sana,<br/>squash banana ♪</i> <i>♪ We we nugu, imi mi apana ♪</i> <i>♪ Asante sana, squash banana ♪</i> <i>♪ We we nugu, imi mi apana ♪</i> <i>♪ Asante sana, squash banana ♪</i> <i>♪ We we nugu, imi mi apana ♪</i> <i>♪ Asante sana, squash banana<br/>We we nugu, imi mi apana ♪</i> Come on, will you cut it out?

You knew my father? Correction, I know your father. I hate to tell you this, but he died a long time ago. Nope. Wrong again! Ha ha ha! He's alive, and I'll show him to you.

That's not my father.<br/>That's just my reflection. No. Look harder. You see? He lives in you. MUFASA: Simba. Father? Simba, you have forgotten me. No. How could I? You have forgotten who you are,<br/>and so have forgotten me. Look inside yourself, Simba. You are more than<br/>what you have become. You must take your place<br/>in the circle of life. How can I go back? I'm not who I used to be. Remember who you are. You are my son<br/>and the one true king. Remember who you are. No! Please, don't leave me! MUFASA: Remember. -Father!<br/>-Remember! Don't leave me. Remember. What was that? Ha ha! The weather. Very peculiar, don't you think? Yeah. Looks like the winds are changing. Ahh, change is good. Yeah, but it's not easy. I know what I have to do, but... going back means<br/>I'll have to face my past. I've been running from it<br/>for so long. Ow! Jeez!<br/>What was that for? It doesn't matter.<br/>It's in the past. Yeah, but it still hurts. Oh, yes, the past can hurt. But the way I see it<br/>you can either run from it or learn from it. Ah! You see?<br/>So what are you going to do? First, I'm gonna take your stick. No, no, no, no! Not the stick! -Hey! Where are you going?<br/>-I'm going back! Good! Go on! Get out of here! Whoo! Ha ha ha! Whoooo! Whoooo! Grubs! Grubs! Hey. Hey, wake up. It's okay! Whoa, whoa!<br/>It's okay! It's me! Don't ever do that again. Carnivores! Oy! -Have you guys seen Simba?<br/>-I thought he was with you. He was, but now I can't find him. Where is he? Ho ho! You won't find him here! The king has returned. I can't believe it. He's gone back! Gone back? What do you mean? Hey, what's goin' on here? -Who's the monkey?<br/>-Simba went back to challenge Scar. -Who?<br/>-Scar. -Who's got a scar?<br/>-No, it's his uncle. -The monkey's his uncle?<br/>-No! Simba's gone back to challenge<br/>his uncle to take his place as king. BOTH: Oh. NALA: Simba, wait up! It's awful, isn't it? I didn't want to believe you. What made you come back? I finally got some sense<br/>knocked into me, and I've got the bump to prove it. Besides, this is my kingdom. If I don't fight for it, who will? -I will.<br/>-It's gonna be dangerous. Danger? Ha! I laugh in the face of danger. Ha ha ha! I see nothing funny about this. Timon! Pumbaa!<br/>What are you doing here? At your service, my liege. Aww! We're gonna fight your uncle for this? Yes, Timon. This is my home. Oh. Talk about your fixer-upper! Well, Simba, if it's important to you,<br/>we're with you to the end. Hyenas. I hate hyenas. So what's your plan<br/>for getting past those guys? -Live bait.<br/>-Good idea. Hey! Come on, Timon. You guys<br/>have to create a diversion. What do you want me to do,<br/>dress in drag and do the hula?

You could be a big pig, too! Oi! Nala, you find my mother<br/>and rally the lionesses. I'll look for Scar. Sarabi! Yes, Scar? Where is your hunting party?<br/>They're not doing their job. Scar, there is no food.<br/>The herds have moved on. No, you're just not<br/>looking hard enough. It's over.<br/>There is nothing left. We have only one choice.<br/>We must leave Pride Rock. We're not going anywhere. You have sentenced us to death. -Then so be it.<br/>-You can't do that. I am the king. I can do whatever I want. If you were half the king Mufasa was... I'm ten times the king Mufasa was! Mufasa? No, you're dead. Mufasa? No. It's me. Simba! You're alive? How can that be? It doesn't matter.<br/>I'm home. Simba? Simba! Oh, I'm a little surprised<br/>to see you alive. Give me one good reason why I shouldn't rip you apart. Oh, Simba, you must understand. The pressures of ruling a kingdom... Are no longer yours.<br/>Step down, Scar. Oh, well, I would, naturally. However, there is one little problem. You see them? They think I'm king. <i>Well, we don't.</i> Simba's the rightful king. The choice is yours, Scar. Either step down or fight. Oh, must this all end in violence? I'd hate to be responsible<br/>for the death of a family member. -Wouldn't you agree, Simba?<br/>-That's not gonna work, Scar. I've put it behind me. But what about your faithful subjects? Have they put it behind them? Simba, what is he talking about? Ah, so you haven't told them<br/>your little secret. Well, Simba,<br/>now's your chance to tell them. Tell them who is responsible<br/>for Mufasa's death. I am. It's not true. Tell me it's not true. It's true. You see? He admits it! -Murderer!<br/>-No! It was an accident. If it weren't for you,<br/>Mufasa would still be alive. It's your fault he's dead! -Do you deny it?<br/>-No. Then you're guilty. No, I'm not a murderer! Oh, Simba, you're in trouble again, but this time<br/>daddy isn't here to save you, and now everyone knows why! Simba! Now, this looks familiar. Hmm. Where have I seen this before?<br/>Let me think. Hmm. Oh, yes. I remember. This is just the way<br/>your father looked before he died. And here's my little secret. I killed Mufasa. No! Murderer! -No, Simba, please.<br/>-Tell them the truth. Truth? But truth is in<br/>the eye of the behold... All right. All right. I did it. So they can hear you. I killed Mufasa! Hee-yah! Excuse me. Pardon me.<br/>Comin' through. Hot stuff. Whoo! Aagghh! -Let me out! Let me out!<br/>-Let me in! Let me in! Please, don't eat me. Drop 'em! -Hey, who's the pig?<br/>-Are you talkin' to me? -Uh-oh. He called him a pig.<br/>-Are you talkin' to me? -Shouldn't have done that.<br/>-Are you talkin' to me? -Now they're in for it.<br/>-They call me Mr Pig! Aaaaggghhh! <i>Take that, you stupid...</i> <i>Take that and that!</i> Run, you yellow-belly! Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! -Murderer.<br/>-Simba. Simba, please. Please, have mercy. I beg you. You don't deserve to live. But Simba, I am family. It's the hyenas who are the real enemy. It was their fault.<br/>It was their idea. Why should I believe you? Everything you ever told me was a lie. What are you going to do? You wouldn't kill your own uncle. No, Scar. I'm not like you. Oh, Simba, thank you. You are truly noble.<br/>I'll make it up to you, I promise. And how can I prove myself to you? Tell me. I mean, anything. Run. Run away, Scar, and never return. Er... Yes. Of course. As you wish, your Majesty! Ah, my friends! Friends? I thought he said<br/>we were the enemy. Yeah. That's what I heard. Ed? No. Let me explain.<br/>No, you don't understand! No, I didn't mean... No! No! It is time.
