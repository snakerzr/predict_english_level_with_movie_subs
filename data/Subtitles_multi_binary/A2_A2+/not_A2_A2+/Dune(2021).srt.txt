[man speaks Sardaukar] [slow dramatic music playing] [rhythmic thumping music\Nplaying] [girl in English]  My planet\NArrakis is so beautiful when the sun is low. Rolling over the sands... you can see spice in the air. [inhuman growl] At nightfall,\Nthe spice harvesters land. The outsiders\Nrace against time to avoid the heat of the day. [thumping music tempo\Nincreasing] They ravage our lands\Nin front of our eyes. Their cruelty to my people\Nis all I've known. [dramatic music playing] These outsiders,\Nthe Harkonnens, came long before I was born. By controlling\Nspice production, they became obscenely rich. Richer than\Nthe Emperor himself. [exhales sharply] -[stabs]\N-[man screaming] [gunshot] [explosions] [screaming] Our warriors couldn't free\NArrakis from the Harkonnens, but one day, by Imperial decree,\Nthey were gone. Why did the Emperor\Nchoose this path? And who will\Nour next oppressors be? [inhales deeply] [breathes deeply] [soft music playing] [Lady Jessica]\NIt's good you're up early. Your father wants you\Nin full dress before the Emperor's Herald\Narrives. Full dress? Military? -Ceremonial.\N-[Paul sighs] Why do we have to go\Nthrough all this when it's already\Nbeen decided? Ceremony. Mm. Thank you. If you want it,\Nmake me give it to you. Use the Voice. Mom, I just woke up. Give me the water. The glass can't hear you.\NCommand me. [wind chimes tinkling] [distorted voice]\NGive me the water. [wind chimes stops tinkling] Almost. [normal voice] Almost? Bene Gesserit skills\Ntake years to learn, Paul. -[Paul] Mm-hmm.\N-You look tired. More dreams? No. [narrator over speakers]\NExtreme temperatures and treacherous weather events make life outside the cities\Nof Arrakis truly hostile, with sandstorms\Npowerful enough to cut through metal. Only the native tribes\Nknown as the Fremen have adapted\Nwell enough to survive. Preferring to inhabit the\Nremotest regions of Arrakis, the Fremen share\Nthe deep desert with the giant sandworms known to the Fremen\Nas  Shai-Hulud. Long exposure to spice\Nhas given the tribe their characteristic\Nblue eyes, the Eyes of Ibad. Little else is known\Nof the Fremen, except that they are\Ndangerous and unreliable. Fremen attacks\Nmake spice harvesting extremely hazardous. For the Fremen, spice\Nis the sacred hallucinogen which preserves life and brings\Nenormous health benefits. For the Imperium, spice is used\Nby the navigators of the Spacing Guild to find safe paths\Nbetween the stars. Without spice, interstellar travel\Nis impossible, making it by far the most valuable substance\Nin the universe. [slow dramatic music playing] [slow dramatic music\Ncontinues] Smile, Gurney. I am smiling. How much will it cost them, traveling all this way\Nfor this formality? Three Guild Navigators. A total of 1.46 million,\N62 solaris, round trip. By the grace of\NShaddam IV of House Corrino, ascendant to\Nthe Golden Lion Throne of Padishah Emperor\Nof the Known Universe, I stand before you\Nas Herald of the Change. We are witnessed by members\Nof the Imperial Court, representatives\Nof the Spacing Guild and a sister\Nof the Bene Gesserit. The Emperor has spoken. "House Atreides\Nshall immediately take control of Arrakis and serve as its steward." Do you accept? [Leto] We are House Atreides. There is no call\Nwe do not answer, there is no faith\Nthat we betray. The Emperor asks us\Nto bring peace to Arrakis. House Atreides accepts. [officers chanting]\NAtreides! Atreides! Atreides! Atreides! Atreides! Atreides! Your seal. So, it's done? It's done. [Lanville] How was it? [Duncan over mask]\NStabilizers are too loose. -We'll dial it in.\N-Thank you, my friend. [Lanville] Got it. [Paul] Duncan. [Duncan]  My boy. -[Duncan chuckles]\N-Hey. Hey. [Duncan]  Paul, my boy. So, you're going\Nto Arrakis tomorrow. With the advance team. Yes, I'm going\Nto Arrakis tomorrow with the advance team. I'd like you\Nto take me with you. You would? Well, that's too bad.\N'Cause no. [Paul] Duncan. Are you trying\Nto get me court-martialed? What's going on? Can I trust you\Nwith something? Always. You know that. [sighs] I've been having dreams. About Arrakis and the Fremen. [ethereal music playing] [Duncan] Okay. So? I saw you. With the Fremen. Ah. So, I do find them. There you go. That's a good\Nomen right there, right? Lanville! I saw you lying dead. Fallen in battle. It felt like\Nif I had been there, you'd be alive. First off, I'm not gonna die. You're not\Ntaking me seriously. That's why\Nyou want to come with me. Listen. Dreams make good stories, but everything important\Nhappens when we're awake. 'Cause that's when\Nwe make things happen. Look at you.\NPut on some muscle? I did? No. Hey. See you on Arrakis, my boy. [sighs] [animal chirping] Father, I'd like to ask\Nto join Duncan Idaho on his scout mission\Nto Arrakis tomorrow. I've studied the Fremen\Nlanguage, I'd be an asset. Out of the question. You'll travel\Nin a few weeks to Arrakis, like the rest of us. I've been training\Nmy whole life. What is the point if I'm not allowed\Nto face some actual risk? You know why, Paul. You're the future\Nof House Atreides. And Grandfather\Nfought bulls for sport! Yes. And look where that got him. I need you by my side. When we get to Arrakis,\Nwe'll face enormous danger. What danger? The Fremen? The desert? Political danger. The Great Houses\Nlook to us for leadership, and this threatens\Nthe Emperor. By taking Arrakis from the\NHarkonnens and making it ours, he sets the stage for a war which would weaken\Nboth houses. But if we hold firm, and tap the true power\Nof Arrakis, we could be stronger\Nthan ever. What does that mean? Mining spice, keeping the Fremen\Nin their place? We'd be no better\Nthan Harkonnens. No. By making an alliance\Nwith the Fremen. That's what I've sent\NDuncan Idaho to arrange. Here on Caladan, we've ruled by air power\Nand sea power. On Arrakis, we need\Nto cultivate desert power. I want you sitting in\Non my Council. Learn what I do. What if I'm not, Dad? Not what? The future of House Atreides. [Leto sighs] I told my father\NI didn't want this either. I wanted to be a pilot. You never told me that. Your grandfather said, "A great man\Ndoesn't seek to lead. He's called to it,\Nand he answers." And if your answer is no... you'll still be the only thing\NI ever needed you to be... my son. I found my own way to it.\NMaybe you'll find yours. In their memory... give it a try. [grunting] [Gurney] Don't stand\Nwith your back to the door. How many times\Ndo we have to tell you? [Paul grunts]\NI could tell it was you by your footsteps,\NGurney Halleck. [Gurney] Someone\Nmight imitate my stride. [Paul] I know the difference. Are you the new\NWeapons Master? With Duncan Idaho gone,\NI must make do as best I can. Choose your blade. I've had quite a day, Gurney. Give us a song instead. [smacks lips] That's rude. [Paul grunts] [powers up] [device beeps] [Paul groans] [panting] [Gurney] Come on. Come on. Old man. [exhales forcefully] [Paul grunts] [device beeps] Ah, the slow blade\Npenetrates the shield. [groans] I guess I'm not\Nin the mood today. -Mood?\N-Yeah. What's mood to do with it? You fight\Nwhen the necessity arises, no matter the mood. Now fight! [both grunting] Come on! -[device beeps]\N-I have you. Aye. But look down, my lord. You'd have joined me in death. I see you found the mood. [Gurney panting] [devices deactivate] Will it be that bad? You don't get it, do you? You don't really understand the grave nature\Nof what's happening to us. For 80 years, Arrakis belonged\Nto House Harkonnen. 80 years of owning\Nthe spice fields. Can you imagine the wealth? Your eyes.\NI need to see it in your eyes. You never met\NHarkonnens before, I have. They're not human,\Nthey're brutal! You have to be ready. [dramatic ominous music\Nplaying] [Rabban] Lord Baron. [Vladimir] Rabban. The last of our ships\Nhave left Arrakis. It's done. [Vladimir] Very good. Uncle, how can we\Nlet this happen? How can the Emperor [shouting]\Ntake everything we've built and give it to that Duke? How? Don't be too sure\Nit's an act of love. [breathes heavily] What does he mean? When is a gift not a gift? The Atreides' voice is rising, and the Emperor\Nis a jealous man. A dangerous, jealous man. [ominous music playing] [voices chanting indistinctly] [voices continue chanting] [voices fade] Paul. [softly] Paul, wake up. What's wrong? Get dressed and come with me. What is this? The Reverend Mother\NGaius Helen Mohiam is here. She was my teacher\Nat the Bene Gesserit school. She's now Truthsayer\Nto the Emperor himself. She would like to meet you. Why? She wants to know\Nabout your dreams. How does she know\Nabout my dreams? And why is Dr. Yueh here? He only needs a moment. [Dr. Yueh] Hello, young master. Your mother asked me\Nto check your vitals. What's happening? [whispering in Mandarin] [in English] His heart\Nis strong as ever, my lady. [in sign language] Paul... [in sign language] [eerie voices]  Who are you? Defiance in the eyes. Like his father. Leave us. [whispers]\NYou must do everything the Reverend Mother tells you. You dismiss my mother\Nin her own house. [Mohiam in distorted voice]\NCome here. Kneel. How dare you use\Nthe Voice on me? [in normal voice] Put\Nyour right hand in the box. Your mother bade you obey me. [Paul breathes heavily] I hold at your neck\Nthe Gom Jabbar. A poison needle. Instant death. The test is simple. Remove your hand from the box and you die. What's in the box? Pain. -[scoffs]\N-No need to call the guards. Your mother stands\Nbehind that door. No one would get past her. [Paul]\NWhy are you doing this? An animal caught in a trap will gnaw off\Nits own leg to escape. What will you do? [high-pitched whirring] [groans] [exhales sharply] [sobbing softly] [shudders] -[grunts in pain]\N-Silence. [Paul breathing raggedly] -[Paul grunts in pain]\N-[shuddering] I must not fear. I must not fear. [stifles grunt, whimpers] [suppressed groan] Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little death\Nthat brings obliteration. -[whirring intensifies]\N-[Paul grunts] And I'll face my fear\Nand I'll permit it to pass over me\Nand through me. [ominous music playing] [dramatic lamentation music\Nplaying] [searing] And when it has gone past... I will turn the inner eye\Nand see its path. [gasps] [sobs] And where the fear\Nhas gone, there will be nothing. Only I will remain. Enough. -[panting]\N-[whirring fading] Like sifting sand\Nthrough a screen, we sift people. If you had been unable\Nto control your impulses, like an animal, we could not let you live. You inherit too much power. What, because\NI'm a duke's son? Because you are Jessica's son. You have more\Nthan one birthright, boy. Jessica? You've been training him\Nin the Way. Tell me about these dreams. -I had one tonight.\N-What did you see? A girl. On Arrakis. Have you dreamt of her before? Many times. Do you often dream\Nthings that happen just as you dreamed them? Not exactly. Goodbye, young human. I hope you live. [Lady Jessica]\NDid you have to go that far? [Mohiam] You chose\Nto train him in the Way, in defiance of our rule. He wields our power. He had to be\Ntested to the limits. So much potential,\Nwasted in a male. You were told\Nto bear only daughters. But you, in your pride, thought you could\Nproduce the  Kwisatz Haderach. Was I wrong? You're lucky he didn't die\Nin that room. If he is The One,\Nhe has a long way to go. His Sight is barely awakened,\Nand now he goes into the fire. But our plans\Nare measured in centuries. We have other prospects if he fails his promise. Do you see so little hope? [Mohiam] On Arrakis,\Nwe have done all we can for you. A path has been laid. Let's hope\Nhe doesn't squander it. [voices murmuring\Nindistinctly] [breathes heavily] [Lady Jessica] Paul. [Paul] What does it mean? That I could be The One? [Lady Jessica] You heard. The Bene Gesserit serve as powerful partners\Nto the Great Houses, but there's more to it. You steer the politics\Nof the Imperium from the shadows. I know. You don't know everything. For thousands of years, we've been carefully\Ncrossings bloodlines -to bring forth...\N-The One? A mind... powerful enough\Nto bridge space and time. Past and future. Who can help us\Ninto a better future. We think he's very close now. Some believe he's here. All part of a plan. [slow dramatic music playing] [slow dramatic music\Ncontinues] [spaceship lands] Shield. [metallic groan] [metallic thudding] [door opens] "My lungs taste\Nthe air of Time, Blown past falling sand..." [bagpipe playing] [band playing\Npatriotic music] Thufir Hawat. Young master! How does it feel\Nto walk on a new world? Exciting, to say the least. My lord. How are you, old friend? My advance team\Nhas secured the city. We're still smoothing out\Na few rough spots. My lady. [woman]  Lisan al-Gaib! [crowd clamoring] [man]  Lisan al-Gaib!\NLisan al-Gaib! [woman 2]  Lisan al-Gaib! [crowd chanting]\NLisan al-Gaib! Lisan al-Gaib! Lisan al-Gaib! Lisan al-Gaib! Lisan al-Gaib! Lisan al-Gaib! Lisan al-Gaib! Lisan al-Gaib! Don't be fooled\Nby the welcome. They follow\Ntheir old masters' rules. Mandatory attendance. That's Harkonnen love\Nout there. [crowd continues chanting] Atreides! [soldiers chanting]\NAtreides! Atreides! Atreides! Atreides! Atreides! Atreides! Atreides! Atreides! [Thufir] Let's get you\Nout of the sun. The heat can kill\Nin this place. [ornithopters powering up] They were pointing at us. What are they shouting? Lisan al-Gaib.\N"Voice from the Outer World." It's their name for "messiah." It means the Bene Gesserit\Nhave been at work here. Planting superstitions. Preparing the way, Paul. These people\Nhave waited for centuries for the  Lisan al-Gaib. They see you, they see the signs. They see\Nwhat they've been told to see. We're good to go. [Thufir] Shield Wall. Protects the city\Nfrom the weather and the worms. [eerie dramatic music playing] [Gurney] The locals call\Nthe big one the Hand of God. [Leto] Well, the Hand of God\Nis wreaking havoc on our comms system. It's so quiet. [Gurney] Yeah. That's what worries me, too. [Leto] There's the spaceport and that plume of dust there\Nis the spice refinery. Our two\Nmost vulnerable points. I want you guarding them. If we can't refine spice\Nand ship it off-world, -we're dead here.\N-[Lanville] My lord. The sun's getting too high.\NWe need to seal the doors. [Leto sighs] What do they say\Nabout this hellhole again? "To shower, you scrub your ass\Nwith sand," my lord. That's what they say. That's what they say. [Thufir] Candidates\Nfor a housekeeper, my lady. What is your name? Shadout Mapes, my lady. [Lady Jessica]\NThe rest of you may go. Thank you. Shadout. It's an old Chakobsa word. "Well-dipper." [speaking Chakobsa] [in English]\NYou know the ancient tongues? I know many things. I know that you have a weapon\Nconcealed in your bodice. [in sign language] [speaking]\NIf you mean to harm me, I must warn you,\Nwhatever you're hiding, it won't be enough. The weapon is meant as a gift if you are truly The One. Do you know this? It's a crysknife. Do you know its meaning? [in sign language] It's a maker... [wailing] A maker of the deep desert. When you have lived\Nwith prophecy for so long, the moment of revelation\Nis a shock. Lisan al-Gaib. The mother and the son. It is yours. Tooth of  Shai-Hulud. [ancient meditation music\Nplaying] [men chanting in distance]\NLisan! Lisan al-Gaib! Lisan al-Gaib! Lisan al-Gaib! [Paul] Hello. You shouldn't be out here\Nat this hour of the day. They're out here. [gardener] Hmm.\NFremen pilgrims. They don't care\Nabout heatstroke. I didn't know date palms\Ncould even be found out here. [gardener] Oh,\Nthese aren't indigenous. They can't survive without me. Each one of these drinks every day\Nthe equivalent of five men. Twenty palm trees. A hundred lives. Should we remove them?\NSave the water? No, no, no. These are sacred. Old dream. [narrator over speakers]\NThe largest and most dangerous organism on Arrakis\Nis the sandworm, capable of reaching\N400 meters in length. To avoid making\Nrhythmic noises, which attract the sandworms, the Fremen cross desert spaces\Nusing the sandwalk, a dance-like motion\Nwith irregular rhythm which emulates the natural\Nsounds of the desert. What scant plant life\Nexists on Arrakis is thanks to the Fremen, who have cultivated\Ndeep-rooted terranic plants such as saguaro, burrobush, sand-verbena and incense bush. The shepherd's tree has\Nthe deepest documented roots, stretching more than\N450 feet deep. These plants cling to life in a parched,\Nnutrient-poor landscape. [slow suspenseful music\Nplaying] [music building up] [both gasp] [Paul] It's a hunter-seeker. The operator must be nearby. [dramatic music playing] [Thufir]  The Harkonnen agent\Nwas cemented into that hole six weeks ago. Ran the hunter-seeker\Nthrough a water pipe inside the walls. Sire, I failed you today.\NThere's no excuse. You have my resignation. You would deprive us\Nof your talents at this time? Sire, my honor demands... They tried to take\Nthe life of my son! I don't give a damn\Nabout your honor. You want absolution?\NGo catch some spies. Your Grace. [Mohiam] The thing must leave. [man] You can speak\Nwithout fear. Our pet doesn't understand\Nyour language. [Mohiam in distorted voice]\NGet out. [normal voice] It understands. Activate silence. [low, muffled speech] [Mohiam] It must\Nnever be known. [Vladimir] There's\Nno satellites over Arrakis. The Atreides\Nwill die in the dark. [Mohiam] On that matter, Duke Leto Atreides\Nmeans nothing to our order. But his wife\Nis under our protection and by extension, her son. Allow them\Nthe dignity of exile. [sighs] House Harkonnen\Nwould never dream of violating\Nthe sanctity of your order. I give you my word. We will not harm them. If the Duke's son lives... No Atreides will live. My lord, you gave your word\Nto the witch. She sees too much. I said I would not harm them. And I shall not. But Arrakis is Arrakis. And the desert takes the weak. My desert. [sinister music playing] My Arrakis. My Dune. [Gurney] Your first\Nstrategy meeting. Paul Atreides, who catches hunter-seekers\Nin his bare hands like a hero of old. [laughter] [whispers] Thanks\Nfor the humiliation, old man. Gotta keep an eye on you. Attention! Let's get started. Thufir. Operations. I secured a copy of\Nthe Harkonnens' account books. [men murmuring] The Harkonnens were taking 10 billion solaris\Nout of here every year. "They shall suck of\Nthe abundance of the seas, and the treasure\Nhid in the sand." [Thufir] We won't see profits\Nlike that for a while. Not with the equipment\Nthey left us. How bad is it? [Thufir] These are spice silos. We're meant\Nto fill every crate. [Paul] All of them? Every 25 standard days. Harkonnen sabotage\Nslows us down. [Paul] But who's\Nmeant to arbitrate? Isn't there\Na Judge of the Change to oversee the transition? Who did the Emperor appoint? Dr. Liet Kynes.\NImperial Ecologist. Been here 20 years. Eccentric, from what I'm told. I want to see these\Nharvesting fields myself. I wouldn't recommend it,\Nmy lord. Have this Judge of the Change\Naccompany us. A meeting's long overdue. And we'll get\Na bit of Imperial protection. A hostage. [chuckles] I love it. Hmm. -[engine roaring]\N-He's here, my lord. [Duncan well-wishing\Nin Chakobsa] [in English] Take care\Nof them. They are friends. [Paul] Duncan! [Duncan] Ah! My boy! [both laughing] I swear you're getting taller. [Paul] Well,\Nyou smell much worse. For four weeks,\NI lived with the Fremen. Hidden in the desert, in a community\Ncalled a  sietch. Stilgar, the leader\Nof that  sietch, has come with me\Nto meet you, sire. This  sietch,  how is it hidden? It's underground. Arrakis is filled\Nwith caverns. How big was the place? I'd say 10,000 people. And there are\Nhundreds of  sietches. Millions of Fremen. You were right. The Harkonnen estimate was\N50,000 on the whole planet. The Fremen watched me\Nsearch for them for days. I never saw them. Finally, they sent\Na warrior out to kill me. And I gotta tell you, I have never come\Nso close to dying. There's no finer fighter\Nin the Imperium. They fight like demons. Desert power. Duncan. -Well done.\N-Thank you, my lord. [man] Sire. Their leader has a knife\Nhe won't surrender, sire. It's a crysknife.\NIt's sacred to his people. Let him pass. [Gurney] Stop there. Hey! Hey! Mm. [Leto] Stilgar. Welcome. Sir, I respect\Nthe personal dignity of any man that respects mine. [inhales deeply] [Stilgar] Hmm. [inhales deeply] [Duncan] Hold. [clears throat]\NThank you, Stilgar, for the gift\Nof your body's moisture. We accept it in the spirit\Nin which it was given. [Leto snorts] [Leto] I'm glad you've come. I believe your people and mine have much\Nto offer one another. No, no, you are Outworlders. You come here for the spice, you take it,\Ngiving nothing in return. That's true. I know you've suffered\Nat the hands of the Harkonnen. Name what you want. If it's in my power to grant, I'll give it\Nand ask for nothing. Mm. I ask for this.\NDo not seek our  sietches. Do not trespass in our lands. The desert was ours\Nlong before you came. So, come and dig your spice, but when you have it, go back to this side\Nof the Shield Wall and leave the desert\Nto the Fremen. You will address the Duke\Nas "my lord" or "sire." [Leto] Gurney, just...\NJust a moment. The Emperor has given me Arrakis\Nas my fief to rule and protect. I cannot promise\Nnot to travel into the desert if duty compels me. But your  sietches\Nwill be yours forever. And you will never be hunted\Nwhile I govern here. That's very honorable. I must go. That's all\NI have to say to you. [Paul] Won't you stay? We would honor you. Honor requires\Nthat I be elsewhere. [speaking Chakobsa] I don't like him. Our plan bears fruit. But it will take time? Yes. It will take time. Here, this is for you. It's a paracompass. The moons here\Nhave a magnetic field, so... a simple compass needle\Nwon't point north. Takes a clever piece\Nof clockwork to sort it out. [Paul] The Fremen make these? And stillsuits,\Nand sand compactors, and all kinds\Nof ingenious things. [Gurney] What the hell\Nis a sand compactor? [Duncan]\NThat's a sand compactor. [all chuckle] My God, man,\Nyou've gone native. You admire them. I do. They're fierce but loyal. They're attuned to the desert. Part of it. It's part of them. You wait till you see it. It's beautiful out there. [announcer]\NSunrise warning, all workers. Temperature today\Nwill reach 140 degrees. We are currently 90 degrees, and in 10 minutes,\Nwe will hit 120 degrees. Last warning call. [dramatic music playing] [dramatic music continues] The Judge of the Change, sire. Dr. Liet Kynes. My lord Duke. Welcome to Arrakis. [Paul] You're\Nthe Imperial Ecologist. Thank you for the stillsuits. They are of Fremen make. The best. With your permission, sire, I must check\Nthe integrity of your suit... [Leto] Whoa. It's all right. It's all right. [chuckles lightly] Dr. Kynes,\Nwe're in your hands. A stillsuit is a high-efficiency\Nfiltration system. Even this early\Nin the morning, you wouldn't survive two hours\Nwithout one of these. It cools the body and recycles\Nthe water lost to sweat. Your body's movements\Nprovide the power. Inside the mask,\Nyou'll find a tube to allow you to drink\Nthe recycled water. [Leto] Mm. In good working order,\Nyour suit won't lose more than a thimbleful\Nof water a day. [Leto] Most impressive. Let's have a look at you, lad. You've... worn a stillsuit before? No, this is my first time. Your desert boots are fitted\Nslip-fashion at the ankles. Who taught you to do that? It seemed the right way. [speaking Chakobsa] [in English] Are you Fremen? I am accepted\Nin both  sietch  and village. Now, come and see\Nthe spice sands on which\Nyour livelihood depends. [dramatic music playing] What would you do if your ornithopter\Nwent down out here? You wouldn't want\Nto go down out there. It's worm territory. Dust cloud. [Leto] I see it. That's one of your harvesters. [dramatic music continues] [machinery clunking] [Dr. Kynes]\NYou can see the spice scattered over the surface. A rich spice bed by the color. If you get a little higher,\Nyou'll have a better view. You see these spotter aircraft\Nlooking for wormsign. [Paul] Wormsign? A sand wave\Nmoving toward the crawler. Worms travel deep\Nbut get closer to the surface\Nwhen they attack. If you are patient, we should see one. A worm always comes? Always. They're drawn\Nby rhythmic noises. Why don't we just shield\Nthe crawlers? A shield's a death sentence\Nin the desert. It attracts the worms and drives them\Ninto a killing frenzy. Is that a worm? [Dr. Kynes] Big one. You have good eyes. Calling crawler\NDelta Ajax niner. Wormsign warning. Acknowledge. [Crawler over radio]\NWho calls Delta Ajax niner? Over. They seem pretty calm\Nabout it. [Dr. Kynes] Unlisted flight.\NImperium business. Wormsign north\Nand east of you. 3.7 kilometers. [Spotter over radio]\NDelta Ajax niner, this is Spotter One.\NWormsign confirmed. Stand by for contact fix. Worm is on intercept course\Nto your position. Contact in five minutes. So, what happens now? They'll call a carryall\Nto lift the crawler. They'll harvest right up\Nto the last minute. [Crawler]  Calling\Ncarryall Alpha Zero. Ready for docking sequence. Contact five minutes. Over. [Spotter]  Anybody got a visual\Non the carryall? [Dr. Kynes] There it is. [Carryall over radio]\NThis is carryall Alpha Zero to Delta Ajax niner. Approaching from your east. Correcting altitude and\Npreparing docking equipment. [Crawler]  Copy, Alpha Zero.\NInitiating docking sequence. [Carryall]  T-5. [man]  Copy that. [Crawler]  Prepare\Nto be airborne in 30 seconds. [Carryall]  Docking sequence\Ninitiated. Brace yourselves. [explosion] [man]  Alpha Zero, we're short\None point of contact. [Crawler]  What is going on? [Carryall]  It's one of\Nthe anchors. It's dead. [Dr. Kynes] Shit. [Carryall]  Carryall\Nunable to receive. Unable to lift\Nwithout that anchor. [Crawler]  All call! All call! Any carryall in the sector,\Nplease respond! Spotter One,\Ngive us an update. Over. [Carryall]  Hydraulics are dead. We won't make it.\NYou have to evacuate. [announcer over radio]\NContact in four minutes. [Crawler]  Try it again! How many men on that crawler? Crew of 21. [Leto] Our ships\Ncan take six each. That's still three short. We'll find a way. [over radio]\NThis is Duke Leto Atreides. We're coming down to extract\Nthe crew of Delta Ajax niner. We'll set down on the west. Shield generators\Nweigh 100 kilos each. Yes, Gurney, have our escorts throw out\Nthe shield generators. [Gurney] Yes, sire. [Leto] And, Paul, I want you\Nat the back of the thopter. Guide them in. Delta Ajax niner, put seven men each\Nin my ships now. [suspenseful music playing] [ethereal music playing] [machinery clanking] [announcer over radio]\NContact in two minutes. [indistinct radio chatter] [Spotter]  Getting close, guys.\NWe better abandon ship now. [indistinct radio chatter] Where are they? [Crawler]  Sir,\Nthere's protocol for a reason. If we take one step out there,\Nwe're as good as dead. Besides, we've got\Na full load of spice. -We can't just leave it.\N-Damn the spice! I want every man\Noff that crawler now! [tense music playing] Hey! Hey! Seven over here,\Nseven over there. Go! Go! Go! [tense music stops] [ethereal music playing] [eerie voices murmur] [eerie voices]\NKwisatz Haderach. [eerie voices murmuring\Nindistinctly] Kwisatz Haderach  awakes. [tense music playing] [Gurney] Hurry! Get on! [men shout hurriedly] [Dr. Kynes] It's here! [Leto] Paul! Paul! [quietly] I recognize\Nyour footsteps, old man. Get up! Let's go! What's the matter with you?\NCome on! Let's go! Run! [tense music continues] [grunting] [Gurney] Hey! Bless the Maker and His Water. Bless the coming\Nand going of Him. May His passage\Ncleanse the world and keep the world\Nfor His people. [sandworm roars] Hey! -You cannot take such risks.\N-[Paul] Yes, sir. You have responsibilities. I... I'm sorry, sir.\NIt won't happen again. Go. Dr. Kynes. You saw it. With your own eyes.\NIt's plain to see. Everything they've left us\Nis in shambles. We've been set up to fail. That carryall was just old. The desert\Nisn't kind to equipment. You know what will happen if I don't get spice\Nproduction back on track. [scoffs] I'm not here\Nto take your part. Arrakis has seen men like you\Ncome and go. Take good care of your family. The desert's not kind\Nto humans either. Spice is a psychoactive\Nchemical. You seem to be sensitive. You'll be fine. Thank you, Dr. Yueh. That wasn't\Nan allergic reaction. I had a vision. My eyes were wide open. What did you see? [eerie ethereal music playing] [eerie voices]\NKwisatz Haderach. You can see. [Paul]  It's confusing. I thought I saw my death, only it wasn't. I know a knife is important,\Nsomehow. Someone will hand me a blade, but I don't know who,\Nor when, or where. Some things, though,\Nare crystal clear. I can feel it. I know you're pregnant. You can't know that. I barely know that. It's only been a few weeks. [priest throat-singing\Nin Sardaukar] [Bashar speaking Sardaukar] [Piter in English]\NAtreides legions are the finest\Nin the Imperium. Trained by Gurney Halleck\Nand Duncan Idaho. [speaking Sardaukar] [in English] Just so. Three battalions. As agreed. [continues throat-singing] [all grunt] [speaking Sardaukar] [whimpering] [crying softly] There is something\Nyou need to know about Paul. [Leto] No. Don't think I want to know. Ever since you brought him\Nbefore your Reverend Mother, he hasn't been the same. He's distracted. Jessica, you gave me a son. And from the moment\Nhe was born, I never questioned you. I trusted you completely. Even when\Nyou walked in shadows. Now I'm asking you\Nthis one thing. If anything happens... will you protect our son? With my life. I'm not asking his mother.\NI'm asking the Bene Gesserit. Will you protect Paul? Why are you\Nhaving these thoughts? Leto, this is not you. I thought we'd have more time. [Dr. Yueh] Have a good night,\NMaster Paul. [Paul] Good night, Dr. Yueh. [Lady Jessica]\NYou need to sleep. No. Not like that. [Leto sighs deeply] I should have married you. [footsteps] [weapon firing] [guards groaning] [wheezing] [shield powering down] [low tense music playing] [soft grunt] [softly] Hawat. Security. [normal tone] Security.

[all grunting in unison] [synchronized grunting] [all grunting] -[Atreides guard 1] Sardaukar!\N-[Atreides guard 2] Sardaukar! [groaning] I'm sorry, my lord. But I've made a bargain\Nwith the Baron. [Leto breathing raggedly] Why? I had no choice. The Harkonnens\Nhave my wife, Wanna. They take her apart\Nlike a doll. I will buy her freedom. And you are the price. For Paul.\NI will do what I can. And you will kill a man for me. I'm going to replace\Nyour peg tooth. If you bite down hard,\Nthis tooth will crush. Breathe out, and you will\Nfill the air with poison. It will be your last breath. But if you choose\Nyour moment well, it will also be the Baron's. [tense music playing] [yelling] [soldiers speak indistinctly] [soldier groans] [grunts] Paul. [door closes] [trooper 1 speaking Harkonnen] [trooper 2 speaking] [trooper 1 speaking] [in sign language] [all grunting] [Duncan] To hell, dogs! [grunts] [alarm beeping] [trooper 1 in English]\NI've never had a highborn. You? Bene Gesserit\Nain't all highborn. [trooper 1]\NShe's highborn enough for me. Let's feed the kid\Nto the worms. And give her a long goodbye. Don't you dare\Ntouch my mother. Don't talk. [in sign language] [Paul sighs] [sternly] Remove her gag. [retches] [trooper 1] Shut up. [in sign language] [panting] [trooper 1 speaking Harkonnen] [Paul breathing deeply] [in distorted voice]\NRemove her gag. [in distorted voice] Kill him. [in distorted voice]\NSet us free. [speaking Harkonnen] [trooper 1 groans] [Lady Jessica grunting] [in distorted voice] Stop! Cut the rope. Give me the knife. [stabs] [grunts] [in normal voice]\NYour pitch was too forced. [Paul] It's a fremkit. [man speaks Harkonnen\Nover radio] [engine shuts off] They've crippled the ship. [distant explosions] [gasping] [sighs] [explosions continue] [wheezing softly] [man] Mmm. [Vladimir grunts softly] [cutlery clinking] [Vladimir grunts] Ah. [munching] You have a wonderful kitchen,\Ncousin. [wind howling] [Paul grunts] This is Dr. Yueh's\Nhandwriting. "If anyone makes it out\Nof Arrakeen alive, there's an Atreides beacon\Nin the fremkit. God willing,\Nthey'll be able to find you." [wheezing weakly] My lord Baron. Dr. Yueh. [Vladimir] The traitor. What do you want? I jammed their comms and lowered their shields. [Vladimir] Hmm. [Dr. Yueh] I delivered\Nthe Duke and his family. [Vladimir] The bargain\Nto the letter. And what was I to do for you? Deliver my wife\Nfrom her agony. [Vladimir] Yes. [slow sinister music playing] [chewing loudly] I said I'd set her free. That you could join her. [Dr. Yueh grunts] So, join her. -[knife slices]\N-[body thuds] What do you think is next? [Paul] It's a thumper. No stillsuits. The one thing\Nwe actually need. For hundreds of years,\Nwe've traded blood for blood. But no more. Your son is dead.\NYour concubine is dead. Tonight\Nthe House of Atreides falls. And your bloodline\Nends forever. [Leto mumbling] What did you say? [softly] Here I am... here I remain. [tooth crunches] [exhales forcefully] -[gasping]\N-[dramatic music playing] [Piter coughs] [cries softly] [soft music playing] [dramatic lamentation music\Nplaying] [engine roaring in distance] [Duncan] Kynes! It's not safe for you here. [Duncan] Will you tell\Nthe Great Houses of the Landsraad\Nhow we were betrayed? How the best of them\Nwere murdered? I am commanded to say nothing. To see nothing. The Emperor\Nsent us here to die. [lamentation music continues] [man choking] [strained breathing] [coughing] [Paul] There's spice\Nin the tent. [coughing] [clears throat] [slow dramatic music playing] [voices whispering\Nindistinctly] [soldiers clamoring] [panting] [slow ominous music playing] That's the future.\NIt's coming. [ominous music continues] Holy war\Nspreading across the universe like unquenchable fire. [voices continue whispering] [thunder rumbling] Paul, you're scared.\NI can see it. Tell me, please,\Nwhat do you fear? [voices continue whispering] Somebody help me, please. Paul. It's coming. I see a holy war spreading across the universe\Nlike unquenchable fire. A warrior religion\Nthat waves the Atreides banner in my father's name. [Lady Jessica] Paul. Fanatical legions worshipping at the shrine\Nof my father's skull. A war in my name! Everyone's shouting my name! Paul. Paul Atreides. You are your father's son.\NYou are my son. You are\Nthe Duke Paul Atreides. You know who you are.\NYou know who you are. [in distorted voice]\NGet off me! [normal voice]\NYou did this to me! You Bene Gesserit\Nmade me a freak! [breathing heavily] [Paul crying] My father is dead. [Paul sobbing] [mournful music playing] [device beeping] [Paul softly] Someone's near. You need to drink. It's recycled water\Nfrom the tent. Sweat and tears. All right,\Nlet's get out of here. [device whirring] [shield buzzing] [shield buzzing] [squeaks] [whimpers] [muffled whirring] [grunting and panting] [squeaks] [Paul grunts] [Lady Jessica panting] [engine roaring] That's Duncan. Duncan. [panting] My lady. Paul. I'm so sorry. Your father... We know. My lord Duke. Here. Drink this. [Duncan] Harkonnens hit\Nevery population center on the planet at once. There must have been\N10 legions, hundreds of ships. There were Sardaukar\Nwith them. -At least two battalions.\N-What? Are you sure? You cross swords\Nwith a Sardaukar, you know it. [Lady Jessica sighs] So,\Nthe Emperor's taken a side. What says\Nthe Judge of the Change? The Emperor forbids me\Nfrom saying anything at all. And yet you risk your life\Nto help us. [thunder rumbling] [man shouting] -[thunder continues rumbling]\N-[clamoring] [worker] Storm's coming. [workers shouting\Nindistinctly] [Dr. Kynes] The storm\Nwill be here in a few hours. We'll be safe here. Do you know\Nwhat this place is? It's an old\Necological testing station. They were meant\Nto tame the planet. Free the water\Nlocked beneath the sands. Arrakis could have been\Na paradise. The work had begun, but then the spice\Nwas discovered. And suddenly no one\Nwanted the desert to go away. Tanat, will you find stillsuits\Nto fit our visitors? TANAT: Yes, Liet. [Dr. Kynes] Shamir,\Na coffee service, please. SHAMIR: Of course, Liet. [door unlocks] Who are you to the Fremen? [indistinct chatter] [wind howling] [Paul] You know what\Nthe Great Houses fear most, Dr. Kynes? Exactly what has happened\Nto us here. The Sardaukar coming and picking them off\None by one. Only together\Ncan they stand a chance against the Imperium. Would you bear witness? Testify that the Emperor\Nhas moved against us here? If they believe me, there would be general warfare between the Great Houses\Nand the Emperor. Chaos across the Imperium. Suppose I presented\Nthe Emperor with an alternative to chaos. The Emperor has no sons. And his daughters\Nhave yet to marry. You'd make a play\Nfor the throne? The Emperor\Nfeared the Atreides. He brought you here\Nto kill you. What don't you understand? You're a lost boy hiding\Nin a hole in the ground. The Fremen speak\Nof the  Lisan al-Gaib. Careful. The Voice from the Outer World who will lead them\Nto paradise. Superstition. I know you loved\Na Fremen warrior and lost him in battle. I know you walk in two worlds\Nand are known by many names. I've seen your dream. As emperor, Dr. Kynes, I could make\Na paradise of Arrakis with a wave of my hand.

Above 5,000 meters,\Nit's mostly dust. Climb into it. Stay on top.\NHead south. Find the Fremen. Are you not coming with us? It only seats two. I'll go to the next station and report this attack\Nto the Landsraad. [Lady Jessica] How? I'm Fremen. The desert's my home. Good luck. [Paul] Good luck.

Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little death\Nthat brings obliteration. [rumbling and clanking stop] [voices whispering]\NSee the friend. See the friend. [Jamis]  The mystery of life\Nisn't a problem to solve... but a reality to experience. A process\Nthat cannot be understood by stopping it. We must move\Nwith the flow of the process.

We don't want\Nthe price to fall. You have no idea\Nhow much it cost me to bring such a force\Nto bear here. Now I only have\None requirement. Income. So, squeeze, Rabban. Squeeze hard. Yes, Uncle. And the Fremen? Kill them all. [wind gusting] [alarm beeping rapidly] [Paul] We're above\N5,000 meters.

[Lady Jessica]  Yeah. [slow suspenseful music\Nplaying] [voices echoing]  Paul... Don't be frightened. [girl]  Even a little\Ndesert mouse can survive. [voices]  Don't be frightened. [girl]  You'll need\Nto face your fears. [voices]  A friend... A friend will help you. Follow the friend. [Jamis]\NYou have much to learn. And I will show you\Nthe ways of the desert. Come with me.

We'll cross after dark. That's how the Fremen do it. [Paul]  We're about to enter\Nworm territory. We can't walk\Nlike regular humans. If we do, we're dead. We'll have to walk\Nlike the Fremen do. It's called a sandwalk. At least according\Nto the filmbooks back home. [Lady Jessica]\NYeah. Yeah, okay. [Paul]  Okay. Follow me. Do the same moves. [compass ticking] I think this is\Nthe right direction. [both grunting] [panting] [distant rumbling] [rumbling fades] [Paul]  It's close by.

We can't touch him. [woman speaking Fremen] [Jamis in English]\NThey are weaklings. [Stilgar] Jamis. That was a brave crossing\Nthey made in the path of  Shai-Hulud. He does not speak\Nor act like a weakling. Nor did his father. [Jamis] My thumper\Nsaved his life. Go back to reason, Stilgar. He's not The One. [sighs] We have powerful friends. You help us off-world,\Nto Caladan, you will be well rewarded. What wealth can you offer\Nbeyond the water in your flesh? [Stilgar] Hmm... The boy is young. He can learn our ways. He may have sanctuary. But the woman is untrained... and too old to learn. [low tense music playing] [sniffles] [grunting] [groans] -[both grunt]\N-[Stilgar] back, you dogs. She'll cut my throat.

See that they are safe\Non the journey. Let's go. [Jamis] I will not have them. [Stilgar] Jamis, I have spoken. Be still. [Jamis] You talk like a leader. But the strongest leads. She bested you. I invoke the amtal. [Stilgar] You may not challenge\Na  Sayyadina. Then who will fight\Nin her name? Jamis, don't do this. Don't. The night is fading. Then the sun\Nwill witness this death. Where is her champion? I accept her champion. [slow dramatic music playing] [grunting] [voices]  Paul Atreides\Nmust die... for  Kwisatz Haderach  to rise. Don't be frightened. Don't resist.
