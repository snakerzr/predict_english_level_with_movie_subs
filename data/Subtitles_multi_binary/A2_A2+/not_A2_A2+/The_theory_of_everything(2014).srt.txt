Oh, it's a sort of mildly\Nterrifying face-to-face thingy. Like an interview?\NAn interrogation. And I told them that if they\Ngave me a second-class degree, then I would stay with them\Nand do my research at Oxford. But if they gave me\Nthe first that I needed\Nto get into Cambridge, then they would never\Nhave to see me again. They gave you the first. They gave me a first.\NOf course.

Um, Michael,\Nthat's so illegible, I can't quite decipher\Nhow wrong it is.\NI suspect enormously. And, Brian,\Nthat's just baffling. Have you even\Nbothered, Stephen? Oh, sorry. Uh... SCIAMA: Right.\NTrain timetables. STEPHEN: Ah.\N(CHUCKLES) That's, uh,\Ntotally unacceptable. These expired a month ago. (CHUCKLES) It's on the back,\NI had a little accident. Ah. I could only do nine. SCIAMA: Good Lord. Oh, thank God. Bravo. (MOUTHING) Nine? SCIAMA: Come in. Ah, Stephen,\Ntake a seat. (DOOR CLOSES) I wanted to talk to you\Nabout your subject. We're all rather concerned\Nas to what it's going to be. I can't decide. Do you have any ideas? No. So, this is where J.J. Thomson\Ndiscovered the electron, and where Rutherford\Nsplit the atom. You know, one of the\Ngreat rewards of this job\Nis one never knows from where the next\Ngreat leap forward is going to come,\Nor from whom. Listen, next Friday,\NI'm taking a few graduates\Nof merit to London to attend a talk by the\Nmathematician Roger Penrose. Do come along,\Nif you're interested. Oh, and close the door\Nas you leave. (DOOR OPENS) (DOOR CLOSES) (INDISTINCT TALKING) So, I gather you've\Nnever been to church. Once upon a time. Tempted to convert? I have a slight problem\Nwith the whole\N"celestial dictator" premise. Now, what are you\Ndoing for lunch? Ma makes a cracking roast. Ah, so, Jane,\Nwhat are you studying?\N(CLEARS THROAT) Arts.\NSpuds? Thank you. Um, French and Spanish. I'm hoping to do\Na PhD eventually. Oh, what on? Medieval poetry of\Nthe lberian Peninsula. FRANK: Medieval poets? What painters do you like? Well, I like Turner. (CHUCKLES) Mmm.\NTurner, really? You know, I always feel\Nthat his paintings look <i>as</i> if they've been\Nleft out in the rain. Oh.\NSTEPHEN: Pa. (PHILIPPA LAUGHS)\NAnd William Blake. FRANK: Thank you, Mother.\NOh, good heavens,\Nsurely not. FRANK: Jane, have some of my\Nelderflower wine. (CORK POPS) Oh, yes, thank you.\NSTEPHEN: Don't touch it. Don't touch it, Jane.\NThank you. Mother? Stephen doesn't like\Nmy home-made wine. Philistine. I'm going to send you back with\Na couple of bottles. (CHUCKLES) So, Stephen, you have come\Nfrom church with a good woman. Are you feeling holier\Nthan thou? Positively saintly.\NThank you. (CHUCKLES)\NYou haven't said why\Nyou don't believe in God. A physicist can't allow his\Ncalculations to be muddled by a belief in\Na supernatural creator. Sounds <i>less</i> of an\Nargument against God\Nthan against physicists. (PHILIPPA LAUGHS)\NLight or dark? Jane, light meat or dark?\NOh, light, please. I'm inviting Jane to be my\Npartner to the May Ball. FRANK: Really? Ah. PHILIPPA:\NVery impressive. (MOUTHING)\NISOBEL: You'll have\Nto dance this year, Stephen. (PHILIPPA CHUCKLES) FRANK: Make way for Mother's leg.\NHere we go. Hello. Hello. (MUSIC PLAYING) Ooh. Sorry.\N(CHUCKLES) You okay?\NYeah. Do you dance, Stephen?\NNo. (BOTH LAUGH) No. I don't dance. It's a phenomenon\NI'm very happy to observe, but I can't possibly\Nimagine participating. I absolutely agree. I mean, who would\Nwant to dance?\N(CHUCKLES) No, I'm serious.\NI don't dance. No dancing, then. You see how the men's\Nshirtfronts and their bow ties, how they glow more\Nthan the women's dresses? JANE: Yes. Do you know why?\N(CHUCKLES) Why? Tide. The washing powder? The fluorescence in\Nthe washing powder\Nis caught by the UV light. Why do you know that?\N(CHUCKLES) When stars are born,\Nand when they die, they emit UV radiation. So if we could see the night\Nsky in the ultraviolet light, then almost all the <i>stars</i>\Nwould disappear and all that we would see are these spectacular\Nbirths and deaths. I reckon it would\Nlook a little... Like that. (ALL CHEERING) (WHOOPING) Wow! Oh! Did you see?\N(LAUGHING) Like those.\NLike those ones... (ALL CHEERING) (BAND PLAYING) Why? Why what? Why Spanish medieval poetry? I suppose I like\Nto time-travel. Like you. Are there any particular time\Nperiods that you like to visit? I imagine the Twenties\Nwas fun. The Roaring Twenties.\NMmm.

What's wrong with\Nyou, man? Chop-chop. (TRAIN HORN HOOTING) A star, more than three\Ntimes the size of our sun, ought to end its life how? With a collapse. The gravitational forces\Nof the entire mass overcoming the electromagnetic\Nforces of individual atoms, and so collapsing inwards. If the star is\Nmassive enough, it will continue\Nthis collapse, creating a black hole, where the warping\Nof space-time is so great\Nthat nothing can escape. Not even light. It gets smaller. Smaller. The star, in fact,\Ngets denser, <i>as</i> atoms,\Neven subatomic particles, get literally crushed into\Nsmaller and smaller space. And at its end point,\Nwhat are we left with? A space-time singularity. Space and time\Ncome to a stop. (INDISTINCT TALKING) I wonder what would happen\Nif you applied Penrose's\Ntheory about black holes to the entire universe. If Einstein is right, or if\Ngeneral relativity is correct, then the universe\Nis expanding, yes? Yes.\NOkay. So, if you reverse time,\Nthen the universe\Nis getting smaller. All right. So, what if I reverse the\Nprocess all the way back, to see what happened at the\Nbeginning of time itself? At the beginning of time itself?\NYes. So the universe,\Ngetting smaller and smaller, getting denser and denser,\Nhotter and hotter as we... You mean wind back\Nthe clock? Exactly.\NWind back the clock. Wind back the clock.\N(CHUCKLES) Is that what you're doing?\N(CHUCKLING) Are you winding back the clock?\NThat is what I'm doing. STEPHEN: Well, keep winding. And you've got quite\Na long way to go.\NKeep winding. JANE: I don't want to fall in. You've got to get back\Nto the beginning of time. You've got\Na long way to go.\NKeep winding. Keep winding\Nuntil you get... A singularity?\NA space-time singularity. So, the universe born\Nfrom a black hole exploding. Keep going.\NWhat do you mean,\N"Keep going"? Before the universe began? No, no, no, no. Keep going,\Ndevelop the mathematics. (FLATLINING) (INAUDIBLE) (COT SQUEAKING) DOCTOR: Okay, all right,\Nvery good. Push it as hard\Nas you can. Push it. Push it.\NAs hard as you can. STEPHEN: I am pushing\N<i>as</i> hard as I can. Why... Come on.\NOne, two... Why won't it... All right, all right. Fourth finger,\Nfourth peg. <i>DOCTOR: It's called\Nmotor neuron disease.</i> It's a progressive\Nneurological disorder that destroys\Nthe cells in the brain that control essential\Nmuscle activity, such <i>as</i> speaking, walking...\N(INHALES DEEPLY) ...breathing, swallowing. The signals that muscles\Nmust receive in order\Nto move are disrupted. The result is\Ngradual muscle decay. Wasting away. Eventually, the ability to control\Nvoluntary movement is lost. Entirely. I'm afraid average life\Nexpectancy is two years. There's nothing\NI can do for you. What about the brain? The brain isn't affected. Your thoughts won't change,\Nit's just that... Well, eventually,\Nno one will know\Nwhat they are. I'm ever so sorry. (BELL TOLLING) MAN: Hello, Brian.

Well, I'm just trying\Nto work out the mathematical\Nprobability of happiness. Are you close? Some integer of zero, but no,\Nnot quite there yet. Stephen. You just missed him,\Nhe was here earlier. JANE: Don't do this. Go. Croquet. Play a game with me. Go. If you don't get up\Nand play a game with me, I won't come back\Nhere again. Ever. Come on. (JANE SOBBING) Leave me now.

I can't.\NI have two years to live. I need to work.\NI love you. (STUTTERING)\NThat's a false conclusion. I want us to be together\Nfor as long as we've got, and if that's not\Nvery long, well,\Nthen that's just how it is. It'll have to do.\NYou don't know what's coming. It'll affect everything. (EXHALES) Your glasses\Nare always dirty. (CHUCKLES) There. That's better, isn't it? Yes. Yes, it is. SCIAMA: Now the solutions\Nto the Schrödinger equation must vanish at the boundary\Nof the box, and so we have... Time. Oh, time,\Nthat's your subject? Any aspect in particular? Time. Come in, come in.\N(CHUCKLING) (CLEARS THROAT) (CLEARS THROAT) I... I don't think you realize\Nwhat lies ahead, Jane. His life is going\Nto be very short. So, be careful.

SCIAMA: Welcome, Stephen.\NMorning. Would you like\Nto take a seat? No, I'm fine. Thank you. SCIAMA: You're sure?\NYeah. So, Stephen,\Nin summary, um, as we know, chapter one,\Nfull of holes, uh, lacks mathematical support. Professor Thorne?\NChapter two, not really original. Uses a lot of Roger's ideas. Well, at least\Nyou run with them. Uh, chapter three, too many\Nunanswered questions. SCIAMA: I agree. And then, of course,\Nwe have chapter four. This black hole at\Nthe beginning of time. Space-time singularity.\NIndeed. It's brilliant.\NBrilliant, Stephen. Superb. Therefore, all there is\Nto say is well done. Or perhaps I should say,\Nto be more precise, well done, Doctor. PENROSE:\NBravo, Stephen. SCIAMA: An extraordinary theory.\N(CHUCKLES) (CHUCKLES)\NThank you. So, what next? Prove it. To prove with\Na single equation that time has a beginning. Wouldn't that be nice,\NProfessor? The one simple,\Nelegant equation to explain everything. Yes, it would. It would indeed. Thank you. JANE: <i>To the esteemed\Nand formidable</i> Doctor...\NWho?

So, black holes\Nare not, in fact,\Nblack at all, but glow\Nwith heat radiation. The steady emission\Nof heat energy causes the black holes\Nto lose mass and eventually they disappear\Nin a spectacular explosion. It's very, very simple, in the\Nway that a body loses heat. Second law of thermodynamics.\NBRIAN: Right, it's thermodynamics. (STUTTERING) If we can imagine\Nthat a black hole is, indeed,\Nlosing particles and over time,\Nwill diminish in size,\Nit will evaporate, it will... Disappear. So first a star vanishes\Ninto a black hole. And then the black hole itself vanishes. Gone, nothing. From nothing to nothing! You owe me another beer.

"Irrelevant in physics." Oh. (CLEARING THROAT) I see. Stephen's done a U-turn. The big new idea is that the\Nuniverse has no boundaries at all. No boundaries,\Nno beginning. And no God. Oh.

The two great pillars\Nof physics are quantum theory, the laws that govern\Nthe very small particles,\Nelectrons and so on, and general relativity. Ah, yes, Einstein.

If the world were all\Npotatoes, then, easy. You could trace\Na precise beginning as Stephen once did. A moment of creation. Hallelujah. God lives. If you incorporate peas\Ninto the menu, well, then it all\Ngoes a little... Tits up.\NOh. (CHUCKLING) Yes. Haywire. It just all becomes\Na godless mess.\NOh, dear. (CHUCKLING)\NEinstein hated peas. Quantum theory. He said,\N"God doesn't play dice\Nwith the universe." STEPHEN: Seems\Nhe not only plays dice, but he throws them\Nwhere we can't find them. God is back on\Nthe endangered species list.\N(JONATHAN CHUCKLING) Well, I expect he'll cope. And physics\Nis back in business. JANE: Yes. <i>Physics is</i> back <i>in business.</i> I was, uh, married,\Nactually. Um... But, sadly,\Nshe passed. Almost a year ago now. (EXHALING) it was, uh, leukemia. Um, she fought it\Nand I nursed her. But, uh, in the end... Um...\N(SIGHING) I do get quite lonely. The, uh, (INHALING DEEPLY)\Ntyranny of the empty room and all that. But music is my salvation.\NTeaching and playing. Not really as a career,\Nbut I'm not very ambitious. Though that's not... (SIGHING) Is that a sin?\NI don't know. Wrong man to ask. Thank you so much\Nfor having me. Thank you for coming.\NIt was really, really wonderful. If there's anything\NI can do to be of service, um, to you, to the family,\NI mean, I would consider it a privilege. I have no children\Nor commitments, so... I only mean that\Nif I could be of help, I believe I might\Nfind a purpose that would help alleviate my own,\Num, situation. (CHUCKLES) Good night. Night. I understand if you need help. If someone is prepared\Nto offer it, I won't object. (LAUGHING) Chilly? (CHUCKLING) (CHUCKLING)\NYeah, it's very bracing. (CHUCKLES)\NCome on. Ready? Yeah.\N(GRUNTING) All right. 17,18... There we go. Right. I'm\Ngoing to put the kettle on. (PIANO PLAYING) <i>(SINGING) Calls you one\Nand calls you all</i> <i>To gain his everlasting hall</i> <i>Christ was born to save</i> JONATHAN: Great, lovely, okay.\NWe can go. Just gone 7:45. (CHUCKLES) Um, could you all\Nleave your copies?\NGoodbye. There's something\NI need to tell you. What? I'm pregnant. (CHUCKLES) Gosh, I, um, assumed\Nthat you and Stephen, um... Well, that's really wonderful. It is.\NYes, wonderful. (CHUCKLES)\NCongratulations, Jane. Thank you. Everyone say, "Cheese."\NReady? On the count of three.\NOne, two, three. ALL: Cheese! Cheese. JANE: (GASPING) Is that your brother?\NOn his bike? LUCY: Mummy!\NJust coming. Oh, come on, sweetie.\NCome on... Now, you know\N(CLEARING THROAT) I've always been supportive\Nof your choice not\Nto have home help, but we need to find\Na permanent solution. This, uh, situation\Ncannot continue. You need to have a proper\Nlive-in nurse immediately. We have help. Look, you know\Nwhat I'm talking about. We can't afford\Na live-in nurse. Stephen, you need\Nto find a way for your family's sake. You're world-famous. For black holes,\Nnot for rock concerts. Stephen, this isn't funny. I believe it's urgent. (WATER RUSHING) We do have\Na right to know. We have a right\Nto know, Jane. Know what? ISOBEL: Whose child\NTimothy is. Stephen's or Jonathan's. That's what\Nyou think of me. There's no way that Timothy\Ncould have any other father\Nthan Stephen. None. (DOOR CLOSING) Jonathan. Please don't go.\NI have to go. Come on.\NEveryone is talking... So, what does it matter? It's difficult for me because\NI'm just trying to help. I know you're trying to help,\Nand your help is valued. The best thing for me\Nright now is...\NI think maybe if (STAMMERING) I just step back for now. Please, Jonathan.\NWe need you. The children need you,\Nand I need you,\Nand Stephen needs you. Jonathan.\NThere's other things as well. Jane, I... (SIGHING) I have feelings for you. And I have feelings\Nfor you, too. Thank you, Jane. I've been invited\Nto the Bordeaux Opera. Invited where? Bordeaux. To Bordeaux?\NMmm. Wagner. The students can take me. I know you hate flying. (CHUCKLING) I do hate to fly. Bring the car. Meet me in Bordeaux. Take the children camping. It'll be too difficult\Nto manage, Stephen. Bring Jonathan. I doubt he would\Nbe willing. (DOOR OPENING) Hello, Stephen. Is this okay? Well... I won't tell if you won't. Just bearing in mind\Nyou have to drive. (LAUGHING) Jane needs help. Sarah, you won't forget a\Nvitamin B injection...\NYes? ...as soon as you land.\NNo. Of course. And you'll call me\Nwhen you get to the hotel?\NI will. Yes? Promise? Good.\NYes. Stephen. Mum will take the baby. (KISSING) She'll be here any minute.\NSee you in Bordeaux. And be good. Are they asleep? (WHISPERING) Yeah. (CHUCKLING) Okay. It's okay.\NI'm all right.\NWhere are the children? I think we've done\Nrather well.\NMmm. Right. Children? Get your sleeping bags. Thank you. (GIGGLING) Thank you. Thanks. (FASTENING ZIPPER) (BREATHING HEAVILY) Jonathan? (GRUNTING) (CHOKING) PERSON: Shh! (COUGHING) Oh, God! Excuse me, sorry. Jonathan? Jonathan. Stephen's been taken ill. He's in hospital and he, uh... He's in a coma.\NStephen's been taken ill? (EQUIPMENT BEEPING) (JANE SPEAKING FRENCH) What are you talking about? This way would be\Na painless end. If we try to bring him round\Nfrom the anesthetic, it's not sure\Nhe will survive resuscitation. You have to bring him round\Nfrom the anesthetic. Are you sure\Nit's what you want? The only way of weaning him\Noff the ventilator will be to give him\Na tracheotomy. A hole in the neck,\Nbypassing the throat. He will never speak again. There's no question. Stephen must live. I will see he gets\Neverything he needs. I will have him transferred\Nback to Cambridge. He may not survive\Nthe journey. Yes, he will. I know. l'll Step back. Did you get everything\Nin the car? His chair and his equipment\Nand everything? (MOUTHS) (ENGINE STARTING) Goodbye. (CHATTERING) Stephen? This is a spelling board. Firstly, you tell me\Nwhat letter you want by blinking when I say\Nthe color of the group that contains the letter. Once I know the group,\Nyou can choose the character\Ninside that group by blinking again\Nwhen I say the color of each letter\Nwithin that group. Apparently. Let's just try. Green. Blue. Pink. Black. Red. Blink to choose\Nthe color of the group of the letter you want,\NStephen. Green. Blue. Pink. Black. Red. (DOOR OPENS) ELAINE: Hello.\NJANE: Hello, Elaine. JANE: Shall I take your coat?\NOkay. (CHUCKLES) Thank you, Jane. Just wait here.\NGreat. She's here. She comes\Nhighly recommended. Promise not to eat\Nher alive. Okay? Here we are. Elaine, Stephen. Stephen, Elaine. Lovely to meet you,\NProfessor. Now, you should have\Neverything you need. But if there's anything else,\NI'll be just next door. Great. I think\Nwe'll get straight to work. Thank you, Jane. Oh, if you could\Nclose the doors.\NOf course. (CLEARS THROAT) ELAINE: We'll get started,\Nthen. Okay. Red. Yellow. T. Green. Black. E. Green, green. A. Tea. You want a cup of tea. Okay. Any preference? You've memorized the board,\NI know you have. I haven't got all day. Green, green. Green, yellow. Yellow. B. Green, blue, pink,\Nblack, red. Red. Green, yellow, blue, blue. <i>U.</i> So, B, U.\N(CHUCKLES) Oh. Builder's tea, right? (LAUGHS) So, how did you get on? You know... I think he's\Nthe most brilliant man\NI've ever met. You're very lucky. Thank you. You must worship\Nthe ground beneath... His wheels? And he's\Nthe perfect patient. He's so funny! When you read about him... Let's see how you get on,\Nshall we, Elaine? TECHNICIAN: That's\Ntightened up. As you can see,\Nit's height-adjustable and we can change the angle\Nto whatever Steve wants it at. You know, it's cutting-edge. JANE: So,\Nhow does it work? It uses\Na very simple interface that scans\Nthrough the alphabet, selects each letter\None at a time. I mean,\Nusing this technique,\Nthe Professor can expect to write about\Nfour words per minute. Good. Better than\None a minute. (LAUGHS) Yes,\Nand what I've done is taken the components\Nfrom a telephone\Nanswering system, actually, to convert\Nthe written text into synthesized speech. I mean, the voice sounds\Na little bit robotic, but, um,\Nshall we give it a try? Great.\NHere's the clicker. JANE: Right hand? TECHNICIAN: There you go. (CLEARS THROAT)\NWelcome to the future. (STEPHEN SPEAKING\NTHROUGH MECHANIZED VOICE) It's American. Is that a problem? Oh, my goodness. Well,\Nis there another voice? That's the only one\Nthey have at the moment. I think it's great. (LAUGHS) (CLICKING) (STEPHEN SPEAKING) <i>Frankly, my dear,\NI don't give a damn.</i> <i>(LAUGHING)\NExterminate.</i> <i>Exterminate.</i> <i>Exterminate.</i> <i>I will write a book.</i> About what? (CLICKING) Time. (STEPHEN SPEAKING) <i>What is the nature of time?</i> <i>Will it ever come to an end?</i> (SPEAKING) <i>Someday, these answers\Nmay seem as obvious to us</i> <i>as the Earth\Norbiting the sun,</i> <i>or perhaps as ridiculous\Nas a tower of tortoises.</i> <i>Only time,\Nwhatever that may be,</i> <i>will tell.</i> Professor? (CLICKING QUICKLY) <i>It is for a friend.</i> Of course it is. That's what they all say. You don't have to be\Nembarrassed in front of me,\NProfessor. I know what men are like. Shall we take a look? There you go. (CLEARS THROAT) (DOOR OPENS) Oh! I'm sorry. Next one? What? <i>STEPHEN: So I said, "I have\Nlong been looking for\Na model of the universe.</i> <i>"I finally found her."\N(LAUGHING)</i> I bet you did. (LAUGHING) Stephen, I need to steal you.\NThe contract's arrived. Could you just give us\Na minute, please, Jane? There we go. Like new. (ELAINE CHUCKLES) "Who are we? "Why are we here? "If we ever learn this, "it will be the ultimate\Ntriumph of human reason, "for then we would know\Nthe mind of God." Do you mean this? Yes. <i>Of course.</i> So, you're acknowledging him? However... "However" what? Are you actually going to\Nlet me have this moment? <i>You are welcome.</i> <i>I have asked Elaine to travel\Nwith me to America.</i> <i>She will look after me.</i> Will she? Yes. You always used to tell me\Nwhen an invitation came in. <i>Another award.\NWhat can you do?</i> <i>I am sorry.</i> <i>How many years?</i> They said two. You've had so many. (SOBS) <i>Everything will be okay.</i> I have loved you. (WHISPERS) I did my best. (SOBS) Careful. That... That's staying. All right. (INDISTINCT CHATTERING) Bye, Jonathan. (BREATHING HEAVILY) (PIANO MUSIC STARTS) (REPORTERS CLAMORING) WOMAN: Professor,\NI love your book! (AUDIENCE APPLAUDING) <i>Thank you.</i> <i>I first met the Professor</i> <i>in 1963.</i> <i>Now there you are. Time!</i> <i>Where does it go?</i> <i>It has been\None of the great joys</i> <i>of my life to watch this man\Ndefy every expectation,</i> <i>both scientific and personal.</i> <i>Please welcome onto the stage\Nmy esteemed colleague,</i> <i>my dear friend,\NProfessor Hawking.</i> (AUDIENCE APPLAUDING) <i>Thank you.\NCould we please have</i> <i>the first pre-selected\Nquestion? Thank you.</i> <i>Can you hear me?</i> (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) Now you are\Nrecognized everywhere. How do you deal\Nwith all the attention? <i>I was stopped recently\Nby a tourist in Cambridge,</i> <i>who asked if I was\Nthe real Stephen Hawking.</i> <i>I replied I was not\Nand said the real one\Nwas much better looking.</i> In 1979, you talked\Nabout the possibility of a theory of everything\Nbeing discovered\Nbefore the end of the century. <i>I now predict\Nthat I was wrong.</i> Professor Hawking, you have said you do not\Nbelieve in God. Do you have a philosophy of life\Nthat helps you? (FADES OFF) You have said\Nyou do not believe in God. Do you have a philosophy\Nof life that helps you? <i>It is clear that we are\Njust an advanced breed\Nof primates</i> <i>on a minor planet orbiting\Naround a very average star</i> <i>in the outer suburb of one\Namong 100 billion galaxies.</i> <i>But,</i> <i>ever since\Nthe dawn of civilization,</i> <i>people have craved\Nfor an understanding</i> <i>of the underlying order\Nof the world.</i> <i>There ought to be\Nsomething very special</i> <i>about the boundary conditions\Nof the universe.</i> <i>And what can be more special\Nthan that\Nthere is no boundary...</i> <i>And there should be no\Nboundary to human endeavor.</i> <i>We are all different.</i> <i>However bad life may seem,</i> <i>there is always something\Nyou can do and succeed at.</i> <i>While there is life,\Nthere is hope.</i> (AUDIENCE APPLAUDING) That came. It's from Stephen. Gosh. Your glasses are always dirty. EQUERRY: Professor and Mrs.\NHawking, Her Majesty the Queen. Congratulations... My Companion of Honour. Not bad\Nfor an old liberal socialist. (WHISPERS) Don't worry, you\Ncan decline the knighthood. Thank you, for today. It was extraordinary. It's all been rather\Nextraordinary though, hasn't it?
