Okay, you're probably going, "ls this\Na Noxzema commercial or what?" But seriously, I actually have\Na way normal life for a teenage girl. I get up, I brush my teeth,\Nand I pick out my school clothes. Daddy's a litigator.\NThose are the scariest kinds of lawyers. Even Lucy, our maid, is terrified of him. And Daddy's so good, he gets\N$500 an hour to fight with people. He fights with me for free\Nbecause I'm his daughter. -Daddy.\N-Cher, please don't start -with the juice again.\N-Daddy, you need your vitamin C. Where's my briefcase? lt's been a couple of months now,\Nso l said we'd go out to Malibu. Don't tell me those brain-dead lowlifes\Nhave been calling again. They are your parents.\NAnd don't try sneaking out of the office. Dr. Lovett's coming by\Nto give you a flu shot. Josh is in town, he's coming for dinner. -Why?\N-He's your stepbrother. You were hardly even married to\Nhis mother and that was five years ago. -Why do l have to see Josh?\N-You divorce wives, not children. -Here.\N-Forget it! Did I show you the loqued-out jeep\NDaddy got me? It's got four-wheel drive, dual side\Nairbags, and a monster sound system. I don't have a license yet,\Nbut I needed something to learn on. Boy, they came out of nowhere. Here's where Dionne lives. She's my friend because we both know\Nwhat it's like to have people be jealous of us. Dude! Girlfriend! And I must give her snaps\Nfor her courageous fashion efforts. Hey, Cher. Dionne and I were both named\Nafter great singers of the past who now do infomercials. So? Go shopping with Dr. Seuss? At least l wouldn't skin a collie\Nto make my backpack. lt's faux. -Hello! That was a stop sign.\N-l totally paused. Yeah. Okay. lt's not even 8:30\Nand Murray is paging me. -He is so possessive.\N-Tell me about it. This weekend he called me\Nand he's all, "Where were you?" l'm like, "l'm at my grandmother's..." Dionne and her boyfriend Murray\Nare in this dramatic relationship. I think they've seen\Nthat Ike and Tina Turner movie just too many times. Now I have to say to her... De, why do you put up with it?\NYou could do so much better. l know. Here he comes. Woman, why don't you be answering\Nany of my pages? -l hate when you call me "woman."\N-Where you been all weekend? -You jeeping behind my back?\N-Jeeping? Jeeping. Know what l'm saying? No, but speaking of vehicular sex perhaps you can explain\Nhow this cheap K-Mart hair extension -got into the back seat of your car.\N-l don't know where that came from. That looks like one of your little stringy\Nthings you got up in your hair. l do not wear polyester hair, okay? Unlike some people l know,\Nlike Shawana. -De, l'm Audi.\N-Bye. -Why do you gotta go there?\N-That's it! l've had it with you! ls it that time of the month again? I don't know why Dionne's going out\Nwith a high-school boy. They're like dogs. You have to clean them\Nand feed them and... They're just like\Nthese nervous creatures that jump and slobber all over you. Get off of me. As if! Should all oppressed people\Nbe allowed refuge in America? Amber will take the con position.\NCher will be pro. Cher, two minutes. So, okay. Like right now, for example, the Haitians\Nneed to come to America. But some people are all, "What about\Nthe strain on our resources?" But it's like, when l had this garden\Nparty for my father's birthday, right? l said RSVP\Nbecause it was a sit-down dinner. But people came that, like, did not\NRSVP. So, l was like totally bugging. l had to haul ass to the kitchen,\Nredistribute the food, squish in extra place settings, but by the end of the day\Nit was, like, the more the merrier. And so, if the government could just\Nget to the kitchen, rearrange some things, we could\Ncertainly party with the Haitians. And in conclusion,\Nmay l please remind you that it does not say "RSVP"\Non the Statue of Liberty. Thank you very much. Amber, a reply? Mr. Hall, how can l answer that? The topic is Haiti\Nand she's talking about some little party. Hello! lt was his 50th birthday. Whatever. lf she doesn't\Ndo the assignment, l can't do mine. Ladies. So, does anyone have\Nany further thoughts on Cher's oration? Elton, comments? Yeah, l can't find my Cranberries CD.\Nl gotta go to the Quad -before somebody snags it.\N-l'm afraid l can't permit that. -Any further insights?\N-l had an insight, Mr. Hall. l'm all ears. Okay. Like, the way l feel\Nabout the Rolling Stones is the way my kids are gonna feel\Nabout Nine lnch Nails, so l really shouldn't torment my mom\Nanymore, huh? Yes. Well, it's a little off the subject\Nof Haiti but tolerance is always a good lesson. -Thank you.\N-Even when it comes out of nowhere. And with that in mind,\Nl'm going to distribute your report cards. Now, is there a Christian Stovitz\Nin this class? Mr. Hall, the buzz on Christian is\Nthat his parents have joint custody, so he'll be spending one semester\Nin Chicago and one semester here. l think it is a travesty\Non the part of the legal profession. Thank you for that perspective, Cher. Now, could all conversations\Nplease come to a halt? And could the suicide attempts please be postponed\Ntill the next period? Suddenly, a dark cloud\Nsettled over first period. I got a C in Debate? -De?\N-What's up? -Did you get your report card?\N-Yeah. I'm toast. How did you do? l totally choked.\NMy father is gonna go ballistic on me. Mr. Hall was way harsh. He gave me a C-. He gave me a C,\Nwhich drags down my entire average. -Bye.\N-l'll call you, okay? Yeah. Isn't my house classic? The columns date\Nall the way back to 1972. Wasn't my mom a Betty?\NShe died when I was just a baby, a fluke accident\Nduring a routine liposuction. I don't remember her, but I like\Nto pretend she still watches over me. Ma, 98 in Geometry. Pretty groovy, huh? Yuck. The maudlin music\Nof the university station? What is it about college\Nand crybaby music? Who's watching the galleria? So, the flannel shirt deal, is that a nod\Nto the crispy Seattle weather or you trying to stay warm\Nin front of the refrigerator? Oh, my, you're filling out there. Wow. Your face is catching up\Nwith your mouth. -l went by Dad's office.\N-He is not your dad. Why don't you torture a new family? Just because my mother\Nmarried someone else doesn't mean he's my father. Actually, Kato,\Nthat's exactly what it means. l hope you're not thinking\Nof staying here. -l sure want to.\N-l'm sure you do. l got a place in Westwood near school. Shouldn't you go to school\Non the East Coast? l hear girls at NYU\Naren't at all particular. You're funny. What's your problem, Beavis? ...infantry furiously trading\Nmachine gun fire. You just got here and already\Nyou're playing Couch Commando. ln some parts of the universe,\Nmaybe not in Contempo Casual but in some parts, it's considered cool\Nto know what's going on in the world. Thank you, Josh. l so need lessons\Nfrom you on how to be cool. Tell me that part about Kenny G again. Come on, you chuckleheads,\Nget in here. Josh, are you still growing?\NYou look taller than you did at Easter. l don't think so. -Doesn't he look bigger?\N-His head does. Josh, have you given any thought\Nto our little discussion about corporate law? Yeah, but l think l'd really like to\Ncheck out environmental law. What for? You want to have\Na miserable, frustrating life? Josh will have that\Nno matter what he does. At least he knows what he wants to do and he's in a good college. l'd like\Nto see you have a little bit of direction. -l have direction.\N-Yeah. Towards the mall. Which reminds me,\Nwhere's your report card? -lt's not ready yet.\N-What do you mean, it's not ready yet? Well, some teachers\Nwere trying to lowball me, Daddy. And l know how you say\Nnever accept a first offer, so l figure these grades are just\Na jumping off point to start negotiations. Very good. Whose is that? De? Hello? Yeah, Jake, what? No, not the afternoon! You are such a brownnoser. And you are\Nsuch a superficial space cadet. What makes you think you'll get\Nteachers to change your grades? Only the fact that l've done it\Nevery other semester. I told my P.E. teacher\Nan evil male had broken my heart, so she raised my C to a B. -Miserable.\N-They're horrible. -l can't eat, l can't sleep.\N-Don't feel bad. l know. And you see, they're all like that. Then I promised Miss Geist\NI'd start a letter-writing campaign to my congressman\Nabout violations of the Clean Air Act. But Mr. Hall was totally rigid. He said my debates\Nwere unresearched unstructured, and unconvincing. As if! I felt impotent and out of control,\Nwhich I really hate. I needed to find sanctuary in a place\Nwhere I could gather my thoughts and regain my strength. Dude, what's wrong? Are you suffering\Nfrom buyer's remorse or something? God, no, nothing like that. lt's just that we've been shopping all day and l still\Ndon't know what to do about Mr. Hall. l tried everything to convince him\Nof my scholastic aptitude but l was brutally rebuffed. Get over it. He's a miserable little man\Nwho wants to make everyone else miserable, too. De, that's it. We've got to figure out a way\Nto make Mr. Hall sublimely happy. Here's the 41 1 on Mr. Hall. He's single, he's 47, and he earns\Nminor ducats at a thankless job. What that man needs\Nis a good, healthy boink fest. Unfortunately, there was\Na major babe drought in my school. The evil trolls from the\NMath Department were actually married. Snickers. And in the grand tradition\Nof P.E. teachers Miss Stoeger seemed to\Nbe same-sex oriented. Of course,\Nthere was always Miss Geist. Something told me not to discount\NMiss Geist. Sure, she has runs in her stockings\Nand her slip is always showing and she has more lipstick on her teeth\Nthan on her mouth. Popular uprisings from Estates\Nto the general assembly. God, this woman is screaming\Nfor a makeover. I'm her only hope. "Rough winds do shake\Nthe darling buds of May "But thy eternal summer shall not fade" Phat! Did you write that? -Duh! lt's like a famous quote.\N-From where? Cliffs Notes. l know you're going to be\Ndoing better, Travis. No, if you run along,\Nl'll see you third period. And we'll try to remember to bring\Nour textbooks. Okay. My God, she actually looked happy! Classic. -Paroudasm Banafshein.\N-Here. Sixteen tardies to work off. Janet Hong, no tardies. Travis Birkenstock, 38 tardies.\NBy far the most tardies in the class. Congratulations. This is so unexpected,\Nl didn't even have a speech prepared. But l would like to say this: Tardiness is not something you can do\Nall on your own. Many people\Ncontributed to my tardiness. l'd like to thank my parents\Nfor never giving me a ride to school. The LA City bus drivers for taking\Na chance on an unknown kid. And last, but not least,\Nthe wonderful crew at McDonald's for spending hours\Nmaking those Egg McMuffins without which l might never be tardy. lf Mr. Birkenstock\Nhas no political messages to include in his speech, l'll go on. Cher Horowitz, two tardies. l object. Do you recall the dates\Nof these alleged tardies? One was last Monday. Mr. Hall,\Nl was surfing the crimson wave. l had to haul ass to the ladies'. l assume you're referring to women's\Ntroubles and so l'll let that one slide. Thank you, Mr. Hall.\NMiss Geist was right about you. What do you mean? She said that you were the only one\Nin the school with any intelligence. Cher, get in here. Yes, Daddy? Would you tell me what the hell this is? A second notice\Nfor three outstanding tickets. l don't remember getting a first notice. The ticket is the first notice. l didn't even know you can get tickets\Nwithout a license. Sure you can.\NYou can get tickets anytime. ls that so? Not around here, you can't. From this moment on,\Nyou will not drive, sit, do anything in that jeep\Nwithout a supervised driver present. No cruising around with Dionne,\Nall right? Two permits do not equal a license.\NDo l make myself clear? Yes, Daddy. l expect you to become a good driver.\Nl wanna see you apply yourself. -l will. l'm gonna practice real hard.\N-Okay. A licensed driver with nothing to do?\NWhere would I find such a loser? Granola breath,\Nyou got something on your chin. -l'm growing a goatee.\N-That's good. You don't wanna be the last one\Nat the coffee house without chin pubes. l can't tell you how much l enjoy\Nthese little chats of ours but in the interest of saving time,\Nwhy don't you tell me what you want? Okay. So, actually l have a permit and l can drive and all but Daddy says l can't take the jeep out\Nwithout a licensed driver. And since you're not doing\Nanything and all... What are the chances of you\Nshutting up till you get your way? Slim to none. Come on! James Bond, in America we drive\Non the right side of the road. l am. You try driving in platforms. l got to get back to school.\NWanna practice parking? What's the point?\NEverywhere you go has valet. What class are you going to? Actually, l'm going\Nto a tree people meeting. We might get Marky Mark to plant\Na celebrity tree. How fabulous. Getting Marky Mark to take time from\Nhis busy pants-dropping schedule to plant trees? Josh, why don't you\Njust hire a gardener? Well, maybe Marky Mark wants to use\Nhis popularity for a good cause. Make a contribution. ln case you've never heard of that,\Na contribution is the giving of... Excuse me, but l have donated\Nmany expensive ltalian outfits to Lucy. ...time and funds. And, as soon as l get my license,\Nl fully intend to brake for animals. And l've contributed many hours helping\Ntwo lonely teachers find romance. Which, l'll bet, serves your interests\Nmore than theirs. lf l ever saw you do anything\Nthat wasn't 90% selfish, l'd die of shock. That'd be reason enough for me. -Would you call me selfish?\N-No, not to your face. Really? ls Josh giving you shit\N'cause he's going through his post-adolescent idealistic phase? Look, there's Mr. Hall. Mr. Hall. Do you drink coffee? Not from this cafeteria. But, yes, under normal circumstances. l am such a retard. When l was packing\NDaddy's lunch this morning l gave him my lemon Snapple\Nand l took his sucky ltalian roast. Do you want it? -Are you sure you don't want it?\N-lt might stunt my growth. And l wanna be 5'1 0"\Nlike Cindy Crawford. l thought maybe you\Nor Miss Geist might like it. Maybe you could share it. -Thanks.\N-Sure. -Miss Geist.\N-Hi, girls. Did you sign up\Nfor the environmental fair? Yeah, we will. You have such pretty eyes.\NDon't hide them. -These clips are so cute.\N-This top is so '80s. And this tiny little waist. You girls are sweet. Don't forget to sign up\Nfor the environmental fair. Not a total Betty,\Nbut a vast improvement. We did our best. We gotta book\Nif we're gonna make it to P.E. Come on, De. l feel like bailing, dude. Come on. l know what you mean, but at least\Nit's exercise. l feel like such a heifer. l had two bowls of Special K,\Nthree pieces of turkey bacon, a handful of popcorn,\Nfive peanut butter M&M's -and like three pieces of licorice.\N-My God. Look. ls that a photo op or what? Would you look at that body language? Legs crossed toward each other.\NThat's an unequivocal sex invite. -Cher, he's getting her digits.\N-Look at Geist. She's so cute. Old people can be so sweet. The entire student body was\Nutterly grateful for the improvement in their grades. -Cher, what's this all about?\N-My report card. The same semester? What'd you do,\Nturn in some extra-credit reports? No. Did you take the midterms over? You mean to tell me\Nthat you argued your way from a C+ to an A-? Totally based on my\Npowers of persuasion. Are you proud? Honey, l couldn't be happier\Nthan if they were based on real grades. -Fabulous.\N-Thank you. I felt so satisfied,\NI wanted to do more good deeds. De, when your allergies act up,\Ntake out your nose ring. Follow through. There you go. All right, Cher. Earth to Cher! Come in, Cher! Miss Stoeger. l would just like to say that physical\Neducation in this school is a disgrace. l mean, standing in line for 40 minutes\Nis hardly aerobically effective. l doubt l worked off the calories\Nin a stick of Carefree gum. Well, you certainly exercised\Nyour mouth, Cher. Now hit the ball. Miss Stoeger, that machine is just\Na lawsuit waiting to happen! Thanks for the legal advice. Dionne, you're up. Miss Stoeger, l have a note\Nfrom my tennis instructor and he would prefer it\Nif l didn't expose myself to any training that might derail his teachings. Fine. Amber? Miss Stoeger, my plastic surgeon\Ndoesn't want me doing any activity where balls fly at my nose. Well, there goes your social life. Miss Stoeger. Got another one. Ladies, we have a new student with us.\NThis is Tai Fraiser. Tai, you don't have time to change, but\Nyou can hit a few balls in those clothes. She could be a farmer in those clothes. -All right, Amber, that's enough.\N-De, my mission is clear. Would you look at that girl?\NShe is so adorably clueless. -We've got to adopt her.\N-Cher, she is tore up. Our stock would plummet. De, don't you want to use\Nyour popularity for a good cause? -No.\N-Come here. Yeah, come here. -Hang with us.\N-Thank you. -How do you like California?\N-Man, l'm freaking. l could really use some sort of\Nan herbal refreshment. We do lunch in 1 0 minutes.\NWe don't have any tea -but we have Coke and stuff.\N-No shit! You guys got coke here? -Yeah.\N-Yeah, this is America. So we decided to show Tai the ropes\Nat Bronson Alcott High School. That is Alana's group over there.\NThey do the TV station. They think\Nthat's the most important thing on earth. And that's the Persian Mafia. You can't hang with them\Nunless you own a BMW. And there's Elton in the white vest. And all the most popular boys\Nin the school. -lncluding my boyfriend. Ain't he cute?\N-Yeah. lf you make the decision\Nto date a high-school boy they're the only acceptable ones. Cher, which one of them's\Nyour boyfriend? As if! Cher's got attitude\Nabout high-school boys. lt's a personal choice every woman\Nhas got to make for herself. Woman, lend me $5. Murray, l've asked you repeatedly\Nnot to call me "woman." -Excuse me, Miss Dionne.\N-Thank you. Street slang is an increasingly\Nvalid form of expression. Most of the feminine pronouns\Ndo have mocking but not necessarily\Nmisogynistic undertones. You guys talk like grownups. Well, this is a really good school. l'm gonna go get a soda.\NYou guys want? -Yeah, sure.\N-All right. She's nice. Project. That's disgusting. That's nice representation there. Thanks. Those are really nice stickers. You like them?\Nl was thinking it was too cluttered. l wanna wipe all this out\Nand concentrate on one main decorative statement,\Nlike Marvin the Martian right there. Get out of town!\Nl can do Marvin the Martian. Really? l mean,\Nthere's not really a lot to him, but -you wanna see?\N-Yeah. Here. -Wow. That's really cool.\N-Thanks. -You drew that?\N-Yeah. And wait, l got -one here.\N-You didn't trace this? No. Here's another one over here. And lots of little guys. -That is so cute.\N-l love to draw. You're really good at it. -No.\N-No, really, you are. -No.\N-Yeah. -Are you sure that's fat-free?\N-Yes. And you lose weight by doing it like this,\Ncutting it really small. -l met a really cool guy.\N-Describe. All right, he's got long hair,\Nhe's really funny. Straight off, right, he offers me\Nsome smoke. There he is. -Are you talking about drugs?\N-Yeah. -Tai, how old are you?\N-l'll be 1 6 in May. My birthday's in April,\Nand as someone older can l please give you some advice? lt is one thing to spark up a doobie\Nand get laced at parties but it is quite another to be fried all day. Do you see the distinction? -Yeah.\N-Loadies generally hang on the grassy knoll over there. Sometimes they come to class\Nand say bonehead things and we all laugh, of course but no respectable girl\Nactually dates them. You don't wanna start off\Non the wrong foot now, do you? l've got an idea. Let's do a makeover. No. Come on, let us. Cher's main thrill\Nin life is a makeover, okay? lt gives her a sense of control\Nin a world full of chaos. Please? Sure. Why not? Shit, you guys.\Nl've never had straight friends before. Now squeeze your buttocks\Nwhen you come up. -Squeeze here.\N-Cher. l don't wanna do this anymore. And my buns,\Nthey don't feel nothing like steel. Okay, it will get easier, l promise. Just as long as we do it every day,\Nnot just sporadically. How do you know\Nif you're doing it sporadically? That's another thing, Tai. We've got to\Nwork on your accent and vocabulary. See, "sporadic" means once in a while.\NTry and use it in a sentence today. -All right.\N-Okay, from now on we're alternating Cindy Crawford's\NAerobicize and Buns of Steel and reading\None non-school book a week. My first book is Fit orFat. Mine is, Men are from Mars,\NWomen are from Venus. Good. That takes care of our minds\Nand bodies. But we should do something good\Nfor mankind or the planet for a couple of hours. Hey, brainiac. The dreaded ex. Tai, this is Josh. Nice to meet you. You know about this stuff. l wanna do something good\Nfor humanity. How about sterilization? -What do you think?\N-l'm amazed. That l am devoting myself so generously\Nto someone else? No. That you found someone even more\Nclueless than you are to worship you. l am rescuing her from teenage hell.\NDo you know the wounds of adolescence\Ncould take years to heal? And you've never had a mother,\Nso you're acting out on that poor girl like she was your Barbie doll. Freshman psych rears its ugly head. -l am not taking psych.\N-Whatever. l'm going to take that lost soul in there\Nand make her well-dressed and popular. Her life will be better because of me.\NHow many girls can say that about you? Mentos better, Mentos fresher Fresh goes better with Mentos\Nfresh and full of life Mentos. The freshmaker. -Be seeing you.\N-Yeah, l hope not sporadically. My God, do you see how boys\Nare responding? -My heart is totally bursting.\N-l know. l'm kvelling. -Cher, you have Diemer, right?\N-Geist. Tai, did you get a flyer? Thanks. A party. lt's in the Valley. The cops usually\Nbreak them up in less than an hour. -lt takes that long to get there.\N-Besides, it's just local loadies. Do you guys think\Nthat Travis is gonna be there? -Tai, l thought we moved on from there.\N-Don't sell yourself short now. You've got something going\Nthat no one in this school has. l'm not a virgin. l mean mystery.\NAs far as everyone's concerned you were the most popular girl\Nin your school. And the fact\Nthat you hang with De and l, well... Speaks very highly of you. lf you strike while the iron is hot,\Nyou can have any guy that you want. -Yeah.\N-Like who? Let's see, who's available?\NThere's Bronson, Brandon. l got it! -Elton. He just broke up with Valette.\N-Yes! Who's Elton? My God, he's way popular.\NHe's like the social director of the crew. And his dad\Ncan get you into any concert. And l noticed him scoping you out. -He was looking at me?\N-Says you gave him a toothache. How'd l do that? lt's an expression.\Nlt means he thought you were sweet. Yeah? -ls that true?\N-No. You are so bad. Okay, you guys, let's all get together.\NThat is great. Smile. Tai, get a little closer. Closer, Tai. Elton, why don't you put your arm\Naround Tai? All right. Yeah, that's good. Okay. Okay. Tai, come here. -Hold that.\N-Okay. Cool picture. -Doesn't she look classic?\N-Yeah, she's beautiful. She looks\Nlike one of those Botticelli chicks. Why don't you make me\Na copy of this, okay? Sure. -Hi, Daddy, this is my friend Tai.\N-Get out of my chair. Thank you, Lucy. lt looks great. What is this crap? Daddy, it's from\Nthe Cut Your Cholesterol cookbook. Dr. Lovett says you've got to get down\Nto 200. -No calls tonight.\N-But it's Dionne. -l'm sorry.\N-lt might be important. We're gonna have a nice family dinner. So, what did you do in school today? Well, l broke in my purple clogs. Yeah, hello? Jake. Yeah. No. De, what up? So check it. Murray's Geometry class\Nis right by Elton's locker and taped up inside was\Nthe picture you took of Tai. -My God!\N-What? Elton's got a picture of you\Nhanging up in his locker. Oh, no shit! Hello! So anyway, the whole crew is going\Nto this party in the Valley. Bye. Looks like we're gonna have to make\Na cameo at the Val party. l told you l wanted it in the morning! No! Just look at the top of the map.\NSun Valley is north. No. All l see is Bel Air, okay? That's it. -Then you're on the wrong map.\N-l'm not on the wrong map. Look at the number on the top. There are no numbers on the top.\NThere's letters. -Murray, shut up.\N-Do you think it's gonna frizz out? Listen, Tai, when we get there,\Nmake sure Elton sees you but don't say hi first. Look like you're having fun\Nand you're really popular. Talk to someone in his eye line,\Npreferably a guy. Make him come to you. And find an excuse to leave\Nwhile he's still into the conversation. The key is always have him\Nwanting more. You got it? -l got it.\N-Okay. Heads up! Did you just see that? God, skateboards.\NThat is like so five years ago. You guys came. That's great.\NYou want a beer? l'll get you one. All right. Yeah. This shit is whack. This is raging. Let's do a lap before we commit\Nto a location. Who was that? Cher, ain't that the same dress\Nthat you were wearing yesterday? Say, Ambular. Hi! Was that you going through my laundry? As if. Like l would really wear something\Nfrom Judy's. Do you prefer "fashion victim"\Nor "ensemble-y challenged?" A clone. Cher, you look much better in that dress\Nthan she did. Ruin my satin shoes, why don't you? l'm sorry. Excuse me, my shoe. This is so not fixable. lt's a small price to pay to\Nthe party gods. Look, l'll make amends. How about some chronic shit? -lt's the least you can do.\N-Okay. Spark it. Elton is over there. Act like Travis is saying\Nsomething funny. Sorry. -What's so funny?\N-Nothing. -Here.\N-Hey, everyone. Let's play Suck and Blow. God, Elton, can't you suck? lt's De. Come on. What have you done? My God. -Why did you do this to your head?\N-'Cause l'm keeping it real. What? Look what he's done to his head. -Can you believe this?\N-Look at Lawrence's head. -lt's the bomb.\N-Know what l'm saying? You look good! As will you. What do you care what he thinks?\Nl'm the one that has to look at you! That was a big mistake!\NWhat am l gonna do with you now? And right before the yearbook pictures.\NWhat am l gonna tell my grandchildren? You know what? Okay. That's it.\NYou wanna play games? -l'm calling your mother.\N-No, wait, hold on. No. -Wait, don't call my mom.\N-Come on. Chill, man. Chill! Don't call my mom! The same thing happened\Nat the spring dance. She spent the entire after-party\Nin the bathroom. That almost destroyed my buzz. l'm still baked. What do you say\Nwe go bump into people? Yeah, l'm cool with that. Tai, wait up. -Are you okay?\N-Yeah. Where's your sense of pit hospitality? That was so cool the way you did that.\Nl wish l could do it. -No, don't.\N-Why not? 'Cause if girls did it, what would guys do\Nto impress them? l don't know, like, stuff. -You know?\N-What kind of stuff? -Tai, l need you.\N-Okay. Elton's over there. Tai. Elton, help me! -You guys should use ice.\N-No, Travis, we've got it under control. Tai, are you okay? Travis, Tai would have wanted you\Nto enjoy the party. lf it's a concussion, you have to keep\Nher conscious, okay? Ask her questions. -What's seven times seven?\N-Stuff she knows. -That's some bump you've got there.\N-Yeah. -You ready to go back out there?\N-Yeah, l am. All right. You sure? Can you do this? Rolling with the homies Yeah, let's do it. You're ready. I had to give myself snaps\Nfor all the good deeds I was doing. It was so great. Love was everywhere. Even though I was alone,\NI was really happy for Tai. It's like that book I read in ninth grade\Nthat said, "'Tis a far, far better thing doing stuff\Nfor other people." -Hello?\N-Do you know what time it is? A watch doesn't really\Ngo with this outfit, Daddy. Where are you? l'm just having a snack\Nwith my girlfriends. -Where, in Kuwait?\N-ls that in the Valley? Cher, I expect you to walk in this door\Nin 20 minutes. Well, it might take\Nlonger than that, Dad. Everywhere in LA takes 20 minutes. Sorry to make you leave. Dionne's bucking for\NBest Dramatic Actress at a Val Party. Hey, Summer. Hi. Pretty random fiesta.\NDo you need a ride home? -That'd be great. Thanks.\N-No, l got her. l'm right below\NWilshire and Linden, so... That's right near me.\Nl'm above Olympic. Great. Then, Tai, you'll go with Summer\Nand, Cher, you'll come with me. Actually, you could take Wilshire\Nto Canon and that turns into Benedict. Well, then she'd have to go back south\Nand l'm already going north. But you could take Tai on your way\Nup to Sunset. -Yeah.\N-That doesn't make any sense. l'd have to get off the freeway.\Nl hate that. Tai, go with Summer. Cher, you'll come with me.\NWatch your feet. Didn't Tai look cute tonight? Turn away l really love her hair\Nwhen it's all wild, you know. lt's also very pretty when it's all up\Nwith that curly tendrils like in that picture l took. You know,\Nyou're one of my best friends. And l do not have friends that are girls. Well, l'm glad because your happiness\Nmeans a lot to me. lt does? Sure. l saw how hard your breakup\Nwith Valette was. Yeah. l think we both know\Nwhat it feels like to be lonely. Whatever. The thing is\Nl'd really like to see you settled already. Where are we going? l knew it. You knew what? -That you were totally sprung on me.\N-Hello! Don't you mean Tai? -Tai?\N-You have her picture in your locker. l have the picture you took in my locker. l'm having a Twin Peaks experience. -l knew it. l knew when you kissed me.\N-Suck and Blow is a game, Elton. No, it's not. Stop it. Fine. You know, l don't get you, Cher.\Nl mean, you flirt with me all year. As if. l have been trying to get you together\Nwith Tai. Tai? Why would l go with Tai? -Why not?\N-Why not? Why not? Don't you even know who my father is? You are a snob and a half. Cher, listen to me. Me and Tai. We don't make any sense. Right? Me and you. Well, l mean, that makes sense. -Cut it out!\N-Come on, Cher. Stop it! Cher. Where you going? You're only hurting yourself here, baby.\NCome on. You gonna walk home?\NGet back in the car, please. Get back in the car. Leave me alone. Fine. Where are you going? Shit. Valley Information. Do you have the number\Nof a cab company? Which one? l don't know which one.\NWhat do you have out here? -We have Valley Cab.\N-Hand it over. Give me the phone. Okay. Your bag, too. Come on! All right. Now, get down on the ground.\NFace down. -Come on!\N-Oh, no. You don't understand. This is an Alaia. An A-what? lt's like a totally important designer. And l will totally shoot you in the head. Get down. That's good. That's good right there.\NAll right. Count to 1 00. Thank you. One, two... The evening had turned into\Na royal mess. Sexually harassed. Robbed. I didn't know the number of the party,\Nso I couldn't call Dionne. And Daddy would kill me\Nif he knew where I was. There was just one person left to call and I really, really didn't want\Nto call him. Come on. -Hello?\N-Josh, you busy? -Who is it?\N-lt's Mel's daughter. So, okay, l was at this party\Nand my designated driver tried to attack me,\Nso l got out so he'd stop. But then he drove off and deserted me. And then this guy with a gun\Nheld me up, took my money and my phone and he yelled at me\Nand he forced me to ruin my dress. Okay. Look, where are you? Sun Valley. Man, you owe me. Look, the man is ridiculous.\NHe doesn't have one unique thought in his little, puny brain. l think that there's some merit\Nin learning forms straight off. Josh, please. He's taken our minds\Nat their most fecund point. -What?\N-And restrained them before they've wandered through the garden of ideas. lt's just like Hamlet said,\N"To thine own self be true." No, Hamlet didn't say that. l think\Nthat l remember Hamlet accurately. l remember Mel Gibson accurately\Nand he didn't say that. That Polonius guy did. l'm gonna walk Heather to her door.\NTry and stay out of trouble. My life is turning into a bigger disaster\Nthan Malibu. I didn't know\Nwhat I was going to say to Tai. I felt really nervous. And even Fabianne, my masseuse,\Nsaid I had a lot of tension in my back. lt's my hips, isn't it? -No, of course not.\N-Yes. Don't be stupid.\NYou could do so much better. -He thinks he's all that, Tai.\N-Yeah, God's gift. You're too good for him. lf l'm too good for him,\Nthen how come l'm not with him? l have got an idea.\NLet's blow off seventh and eighth go to the mall, have a calorie fest,\Nand see the new Christian Slater. Yes! You guys. Look at him. Baby! Break me off a piece of that. -Survey says?\N-Doable. Puny. l like them big. l hate muscles. You know what,\Nl don't really care either way. Just as long as his you-know-what\Nisn't crooked. l really hate that. What? -Don't scare her.\N-Why, what's wrong? Cher's saving herself for Luke Perry. Cher, you're a virgin? God, you say that like it's a bad thing. Besides, the P.C. term\Nis "hymenally challenged." l am just not interested in doing it\Nuntil l find the right person. You see how picky l am about\Nmy shoes, and they only go on my feet. Yeah. -God, you're one to talk, De.\N-Wait a minute here. Wait. l thought that, like,\Nyou and Murray were... My man is satisfied.\NHe's got no cause for complaints. But technically, l am a virgin.\NYou know what l mean. Oh, God. -What's wrong, Tai?\N-They're playing our song. You know, the one that Elton and l\Ndanced to. Rolling with the homies -Tai. Don't cry.\N-l'm sorry. Oh, God. Stop! I could tell Tai's grieving period\Nwould be considerable unless I found someone\Nto take Elton's place right away. So, okay, I don't want to be a traitor\Nto my generation and all but I don't get how guys dress today. I mean, come on,\Nit looks like they just fell out of bed and put on some baggy pants\Nand take their greasy hair and cover it up with a backwards cap\Nand, like, we're expected to swoon? I don't think so. Searching for a boy in high school is\Nas useless as searching for meaning in a Pauly Shore movie. So this must be the elusive Christian. -Where should l park?\N-There's one, third back. Okay. Now I know I said I'd find\Na guy for Tai but I suppose there's no harm\Nin finding one for myself also. Nice stems. Thanks. -Cher?\N-Present. l guess we established that\Nduring attendance. -lt's time for your oral.\N-Excuse me? Your original oral.\NThe topic is violence in the media. So, okay. The Attorney General says there's too much violence on TV\Nand that should stop. But even if you took out all the violent\Nshows, you could still see the news. Until mankind is peaceful enough\Nnot to have violence on the news there's no point in taking it out of shows\Nthat need it for entertainment value. Thank you. Any comments? Elton? My foot hurts. Can l go to the nurse? Travis? Two very enthusiastic thumbs up.\NFine holiday fun. Hello! Was l the only one listening? l mean, l thought it reeked. l believe that was your\Ndesigner imposter perfume. l dug it. During the next few days,\NI did what any normal girl would do... I sent myself love letters and flowers and candy... just so he'd see how desired I was,\Nin case he didn't already know. Christian. And anything you can do\Nto draw attention to your mouth is good. Also, sometimes\Nyou have to show a little skin. This reminds guys of being naked,\Nand then they think of sex. -Hey, duchess?\N-Yes? You rationed this weekend? Like Saturday. l'm new, but l thought maybe\Nyou had an in on the heavy clambakes. My ex-stepbrother's friends\Nare having a party. Solid. Suddenly Daddy had a case\Nthat had to be solved right away so some clerks and Josh came to help\Nhim go through a gazillion depositions. -Daddy!\N-What? l can't just open it,\Nl have to make him wait a while! Then he can wait outside. Josh, please? Come on, Josh! Come on! What do you hear? She's not ready. Hey, man. Nice pile of bricks you got here. -You drink?\N-No, thanks. l'm cool. l'm not offering.\Nl'm asking you if you drink. You think l'd give alcohol to\Nteenage drivers taking my daughter out? Hey, man, the protective vibe, l dig. What's with you, kid? You think the death of Sammy Davis\Nleft an opening in the rat pack? Christian. Doll face. Handsome. Stunning. You're not letting her go out like that,\Nare you? -Cher, get in here.\N-What's up, Daddy? -What the hell is that?\N-A dress. -Says who?\N-Calvin Klein. lt looks like underwear!\NGo upstairs and put something over it! l was just going to. Hey, you! Anything happens to my daughter,\Nl got a .45 and a shovel. l doubt anybody would miss you. Bye, Daddy. Come on. -lt's so killer.\N-Thank you. -Your dad is pretty scary.\N-lsn't he? -You like Billie Holiday?\N-l love him. Right. -l didn't like him.\N-What's to like? -Maybe l should go to the party.\N-lf you feel like you should go. -You don't need me, do you?\N-No. -l mean, unless you want me to stay...\N-Josh, go to the party. Go. Okay. -l'll watch her for you.\N-Okay. You do that. Tai! Oh, my God! Tai, are you okay? God, shit, that is so embarrassing. No, no one saw. Good. Now all night long l'll be known\Nas "that girl who fell on her butt." Tai, no one noticed. Wow, are you okay?\NThat looked really bad. Yeah, thanks. Oh, my God, Cher, look. He's going with Amber? No, he's probably just dancing with her. -Do you think she's pretty?\N-She's a full-on Monet. -What's a Monet?\N-lt's like the paintings, see? From far away it's okay,\Nbut up close it's a big old mess. Let's ask a guy. Christian, what do you think ofAmber? -Hagsville.\N-See? Dig this, they're charging for brewskies. -Pass me a fin, l'll pay you back?\N-Sure. Thanks. Oh, he is so cute. Oh, my God, do you see\Nhow he's falling in love with me? Excuse me. l mean, look how he ignores\Nevery other girl. What's it all about?\NWhat am l gonna do with that? l wouldn't know. Oh, God, look. There's Josh. l didn't even see him come in. But it's\Nlike he finds the only adult in here. Like he's deliberately trying\Nto not have fun. Cher, l have a question. What should l do with this,\Nshould l tie it around -or put it over my shoulders?\N-Tie it around your waist. -Ready to slide?\N-Thanks. Let's go. The band was kicking\Nand Christian was the hottest guy there. But my enjoyment was put on pause\Nwhen I saw how unhappy Tai was. -Hi.\N-Hi. When l see a beautiful girl,\Nl think we were born to move. What? Look! Josh is dancing with Tai!\NHe never dances. l can see why. No, he's doing her a prop\Nso she won't be left out. Oh, l dig you. -How are you guys holding up?\N-l'm so ready to leave. Tired. Let's get Christian and go. Christian -you wanna go?\N-Now? These guys right here got the skinny\Non the happening after-hours. My trainer's coming really early\Nthis morning. -Look, l could take the girls home.\N-No, that's all right. -No, it's fine, stay.\N-You sure? Yeah, sure. Thanks, man. You got my marker. You are a down girl.\Nl'll call you tomorrow. lt was really decent of you\Nto dance with Tai tonight. My pleasure. Did you notice\Nany positive changes in her? Yeah. Under your tutelage, she's exploring\Nthe challenging world of bare midriffs. So you didn't want to make a night of it\Nwith the ring-a-ding kid? Yeah, Daddy wouldn't go too ballistic. lt's not like he's going to sleep. No. Not if they're going\Nto finish those depos. Hey, you know what would be so dope?\Nlf we got some really delicious takeout. l bet they haven't eaten all night. Yeah, that would be pretty dope of us. Let's do it. The midnight snack totally revived the\Nlawyers and Daddy was way grateful. Meat. Eat oranges, you get a lot of vitamin C.\NDaddy, no! -You know you can't have that.\N-Cher, come on! Don't be silly. I know it sounds mental but sometimes I have more fun\Nvegging out than when I go partying. Maybe because my party clothes\Nare so binding. Look, l'm just curious. How many hours a day do you spend\Ngrooming yourself? Some people are not lucky enough\Nto be as naturally adorable as you are. Stop it, you're making me blush. Hello. Hi, Cher, how are you? Hi, Gail. Is my son there\Ncleaning out your refrigerator? No, he's not here. You should try the dorms. All right. Bye, hon. Bye-bye. What was that all about? She wants me to come home\Nfor spring break. What's the big deal?\NNobody will be in school. Yeah, but Husband Number 4\Nis at home and his whole idea\Nof acting like a family is to criticize me. So what, you're gonna roam around\Ncampus for two weeks all by yourself? l don't mind. That is stupid.\NWhy don't you just come here, you can have your old room, and\Nthere are gonna be some great parties. -No.\N-Why not? You got your whole social world\Ngoing on. l don't want to get in the way. You won't be in the way. How much fun would it be\Nhaving a brother-type tagging along? Josh, you are not my brother. Look, you know what l mean. Come on, you need some excitement\Nin your life. lt will replenish you for your finals. -Okay.\N-Good. l can't believe l'm taking advice\Nfrom someone who watches cartoons. Be quiet, you idiot! That's Ren and Stimpy. They are way existential. Do you have any idea\Nwhat you're talking about? No. Why, do l sound like l do? Christian said he'd call the next day,\Nbut in boy time that meant Thursday. You can imagine my astonishment to hear from him\Nwhile I was packing Daddy up. Hello? He said he'd come over with\Nsome videotapes and we'd watch them. A night alone with Christian?\NI sent for reinforcements. De! Then De and I\Nhad to design a lighting concept. And costume decisions. I don't rely on mirrors\Nso I always take Polaroids. Whenever a boy comes, you should\Nalways have something baking. Oh! l'm still all red! l'm trying to make you\Nas white as l can, Cher. Look, you're all flushed.\NYou have to calm down. Okay, calm. You know, l am so glad l never did it with someone\Nl had lukewarm feelings for 'cause Christian is brutally hot. And l am gonna\Nremember tonight forever. Blot. Hi. Something burning? Oh, my God! Oh, honey, you baked. l tried. Come on. Show me the rest of your pad. Your father\Nhas a well-rounded collection. Daddy says it's a good investment. He's absolutely right. Claes Oldenburg. Oh, he's way famous. But this is older, see? Transitional. A very important piece. You want to go swimming? -Let's watch the movies.\N-Oh, okay. Christian had a thing for Tony Curtis so he brought over Some Like lt Hot\Nand Sparaticus. Singer of songs. For whom did you practice\Nthis wondrous talent? For the children of my master\Nwhom I also taught the classics. Classics, indeed? What position have we, I wonder,\Nfor a boy of such varied gifts? You shall be my body servant.\NInstruct him. All of you, come with me. My feet are cold. Thanks. Oh, watch this part. This is good. Are you okay? l'm fine. Do you want something to drink?\NYou know, l could get you some wine. No. You notice how wine makes people\Nwant to feel, like sexy? That's okay. l'm actually getting tired. But l can make you some coffee\Nif you'd like. Oh, no, thanks. Got the ulcer. You had all those cappuccinos before. Well, you know, that was, like, foam. You're great. We're friends, right? Knock me a little kiss. l'll see you. I don't get it. Did my hair get flat? Did I stumble into some bad lighting? What's wrong with me? Nothing! Maybe he really was tired. l suppose it wasn't meant to be.\Nl mean, he does dress better than l do. What would l bring to the relationship? Get back into the right lane.\NWhat's the first thing you do? The first thing l do is l put on my blinker. Oh, wait, shit. -Watch the road!\N-All right! Stop! Then l look in my mirror. Okay. Then l glance at my blind spot. You glance with your head\Nnot the whole car! l swear to God... l swear to God, woman,\Nyou can't drive for shit! -l'm not trying to hear that. No.\N-Hear me! You... Actually, going all the way\Nis like a really big decision. l can't believe\Nl was so capricious about it. De, l almost had sex with him. You almost had sex with who? Christian. What? Look, are you bitches\Nblind or something? -Your man Christian is a cake boy.\N-A what? He's a disco-dancing,\NOscar Wilde-reading, Streisand ticket-holding,\Nfriend of Dorothy. You know what l'm saying? -No way.\N-He's gay. -Not even.\N-Yes, even. He does like to shop, Cher.\NAnd the boy can dress. Oh, my God, l am totally bugging. l feel like such a bonehead. What the hell?\NYou're getting on the freeway! -What?\N-No, turn right! Get out of the lane! No! Forget procedure,\Njust get out of the lane! A truck! We're on the freeway! What do l do, Murray? Just go straight! Go straight! Go! Oh, shit! Just relax and drive, baby.\NJust relax and drive. Okay. l'm here with you. Shut up! Whatever you do, keep your hands\Non the wheel at all times! Oh, my God! Just go! -Turn to the right!\N-Okay. Oh, there it is. All right, we're off. You did wonderful. -lt's all right, baby. Relax.\N-You did it, De. Honey, relax. Baby, relax. Breathe, breathe in.\NBreathe and let it out. Breathe, honey, breathe. Relax. Boy, getting off the freeway makes\Nyou realize how important love is. After that, Dionne's virginity\Nwent from "technical" to "nonexistent" and I realized how much\NI wanted a boyfriend of my own. Not that Christian wasn't a blast\Nto hang out with, he was becoming one of my favorite\Nshopping partners. The black one was, but so is the red. Where's Tai? She met some random guys\Nat the Foot Locker and escorted them right over there. Oh, my God, did you? l don't know where she meets\Nthese Barneys. -l have a question, all right?\N-What? The jacket, is it James Dean\Nor Jason Priestley? Carpe diem, okay? You looked hot in it. Really? -lf l fall...\N-Don't worry. -...would you guys catch me?\N-Yeah! Could they please be more generic? Stop it! Please! Put me back up! Please put me back! Put me down! Thank you. -You asshole!\N-Hey, man, we're just joking. Oh, really? Somebody could get killed. -Oh, my God.\N-lt's okay. Cher, you don't understand,\Nl was sitting there and l was talking to those guys\Nand all of a sudden we were laughing and they were... -Hey, you okay?\N-Yeah. -You sure?\N-l'm fine. -Let's get you home for some R and R.\N-What's that? Boy, considering\Nhow clueless she was Tai certainly had\Nthat damsel in distress act down. Meanwhile, back at school,\Neveryone was talking about Tai's brush with death at the mall. Was it like a montage of all the scenes\Nin your life? Not exactly a montage. Cher, is it true some gang members\Ntried to shoot Tai in the mall? No. Well, that's what everyone is saying. Whatever. When l was 9, l fell off this jungle gym. That G-spot\Nthat they talk about in Cosmo... Wait, move down for Cher. Hi. Tell me more. Where was l? You were thinking\Nabout what was really important. Right. Okay, right before you die,\Nyour mind just sort of gets very clear. lt's a very intense spiritual feeling... l know when l was held at gunpoint... -Excuse me. You were saying?\N-lt's spiritual. l don't know, l can't pinpoint\Nthe spirituality of it for you if you've never experienced\Nanything quite... Tai, l was planning on going to Tower\Nand getting something for Christian. You know, like some kind of present\Nor something. You want to come? Sure. l mean, l owe him my life. So l'll get you after school. Yeah. You know, not today,\Nl'm going over to Melrose with Amber. We're going to Melrose. How about tomorrow? Do you think\Nwe could do it next Monday? l mean my week's filling up\Npretty fast here. So when we got back from the lHOP\Nit was 8:00. Oh, swoon. Here comes your boyfriend. Hey, Tai, check it out. Could you shove down a little bit? No. Hello, don't the slackers\Nprefer that grassy knoll over there? Tai. -Well, so anyway...\N-What? Have you ever done it in water? -Oh, yeah.\N-Really? Does the sponge work in water? What was happening? Dionne asking Tai for sex advice? Tai being the most popular girl\Nin school? It was like some sort of\Nalternate universe. On top of everything else,\NI was going to take the driving test. So I had to find\Nmy most responsible-looking ensemble. Where's my white collarless shirt\Nfrom Fred Segal? -Lucy, where's my shirt?\N-Probably at the cleaner. But today's the driving test.\Nlt's my most capable-looking outfit. Okay, l call them. lt's too late now. We got another notice\Nfrom the fire department saying we have to clear out the bush. You said you were gonna get\NJosé to do it. He's your gardener,\Nwhy you don't tell him? Lucy, you know l don't speak Mexican. l not a Mexican! -Great. What was that all about?\N-Lucy's from El Salvador. So? lt's an entirely different country. What does that matter? You get upset if someone thinks\Nyou live below Sunset. Okay. So everything is all my fault.\Nl'm always wrong, right? You're such a brat. I had an overwhelming sense\Nof ickiness. Even though I apologized to Lucy,\Nsomething was still plaguing me. Like Josh thinking I was mean\Nwas making me postal. Move into the right lane. Anyway, why should I care\Nwhat Josh thinks? Why was I letting it\Nthrow me into such turmoil? -Watch out for the bike rider!\N-Hey! Oops, my bad. What are you doing?\NYou can't take up both lanes. Get in the right lane. Not so close! Should l write them a note? Pull over up here\Nand turn off the engine. Yeah, right there. Are you gonna take me somewhere\Nto make left-hand turns? We're going back to the DMV. -lt's over?\N-lt's over. -Well, how did l do?\N-How'd you do? Well, let's see, shall we? You can't park. You can't switch lanes. You can't make right-hand turns.\NYou've damaged private property and you almost killed someone. Offhand, l'd say you failed. Failed? Well, can't we just start over? l'm kind of having a personal problem. My mind was somewhere else. You saw how that biker\Ncame out of nowhere, right? l swear l'll concentrate. l drive really good usually. lsn't there somebody else l can talk to?\NA supervisor or something? You can't be the absolute and final word\Nin drivers' licenses. Girlie, as far as you're concerned,\Nl am the messiah of the DMV. Now get out of the car. I can't believe I failed. I failed something\NI couldn't talk my way out of? All right. Put your legs into me.\NThank you. Okay. -Hey.\N-Hey. -You're home.\N-How does it feel to have a license? l wouldn't know. l failed. Oh. Bummer. And, Josh, spare me your lectures on how driving\Nis such a big responsibility you can't B.S. your way through it, okay? l didn't say anything. l know what you're thinking. l got to tell you something. l'm really sorry about your test and all. l'm so glad you're here. There's something l got to do and\Nl need you here with me while l do it. -Does this thing work?\N-Yeah. Sure. What is this stuff? This is a bunch ofjunk\Nthat reminded me of Elton. But l want to burn it\Nbecause l am so over him. -Well, what stuff?\N-All right. Do you remember\Nwhen we were at the Val party and the clog knocked me out\Nand Elton got a towel of ice to cure me? Yeah. l didn't tell you at the time,\Nbut l took the towel home as a souvenir. -You're kidding.\N-No. And then, do you remember that song\Nthat was playing when we danced? Remember that?\NYou know, the Rolling with the Homies? Anyways, l got the tape, right?\Nl listened to it like every single night. Don't burn that. Okay. Tai, l'm really happy for you but what brought on\Nthis surge of empowerment? lt's like l met this guy\Nwho's so totally amazing that he makes Elton look like a loser. That is so great. Look, you've got to help me get Josh. Get Josh what? You know what l mean. l like him. Do you think that he likes you? Yeah. How do you know? Like little things, you know? He always... He finds some sort of way\Nto touch me or tickle me. Do you remember the time at the frat\Nwhen l was totally depressed and he asked me to dance with him\Nand he was really flirty? You okay? Yeah. Actually, l was really bad today. l had two mochaccinos.\Nl feel like ralphing. l know exactly how that feels. Like, the other day,\Nl was talking to Josh and we were discussing the difference between high-school girls\Nand college girls. College girls wear less makeup\Non their face and that's why guys like them more. But, Tai, do you really think\Nyou'd be good with Josh? l mean, he's like a school nerd. What, am l some sort of\Na mentally challenged airhead? No, not even. l didn't say that. What, l'm not good enough\Nfor Josh or something? l just don't think you'd mesh well together. You don't think that we mesh well? Why am l even listening\Nto you to begin with? You're a virgin who can't drive. That was way harsh, Tai. All right. Look, l'm really sorry. Let's just talk when we've mellowed,\Nall right? l'm Audi. What did I do? I've created some sort of a monster. I could feel the chunks\Nstart to rise up in my throat. I had to get out. Everything I think\Nand everything I do is wrong. I was wrong about Elton,\NI was wrong about Christian... now Josh hated me. It all boiled down\Nto one inevitable conclusion: I was just totally clueless. Oh, and this Josh and Tai thing\Nwas wigging me more than anything. I mean, what was my problem?\NTai is my pal. I don't begrudge her a boyfriend.\NI really... I wonder if they have that in my size. What does she want with Josh anyway? He dresses funny,\Nhe listens to complaint rock he's not even cute\Nin a conventional way. I mean, he's just like this slug who hangs around the house\Nall the time. And he's a hideous dancer. Couldn't take him anywhere. Wait a second,\Nwhat am I stressing about? This is, like, Josh. Okay, so he is kind of a Baldwin. But what would he want with Tai? She couldn't make him happy. Josh needs someone with imagination,\Nsomeone to take care of him. Someone to laugh at his jokes,\Nin case he ever makes any. Then suddenly... Oh, my God! l love Josh. I am majorly, totally,\Nbutt crazy in love with Josh! But now I don't know\Nhow to act around him. Ordinarily, I'd strut around him\Nin my cutest little outfits and send myself flowers and candy but I couldn't do that stuff with Josh. -What's with you?\N-What do you mean? You're so quiet. Haven't made me watch\NThe Real World. l care about the news. -Since when?\N-Since now. ...retaliation for recent government\Nsuccesses in central Bosnia. You look confused. Well, l thought they declared peace\Nin the Middle East. -Cher, get in here.\N-What's up, Daddy? What are you doing\Ndancing in front of my office? Nothing. l just wanted to see\Nif you need any help with anything. Yeah, you could help me\Nwith something. Come over here. All right. Every time that you see\Na telephone conversation that took place on September 3,\Nhighlight it. -Just September 3.\N-Okay. lt's fun? Yeah. Okay. Daddy, did you ever have a problem\Nthat you couldn't argue your way out of? Tell me the problem\Nand we'll figure out how to argue it. -l like this boy...\N-Yes? ...and he likes someone else. -How could that be?\N-l don't know, but l feel wretched. Obviously this boy is a complete moron. You are the most beautiful girl\Nin Beverly Hills. To tell you the truth, l'm not sure\Nl want you with a stupid fellow like that. Actually he is a smart guy and, you know,\Nhe's one of those do-gooder types and now l feel like all my after-school\Ncommitments are just not good enough. How can you say that? Who takes care of everyone\Nin this household? Who makes sure that Daddy eats right? To tell you the truth,\Nl have not seen such good doing since your mother. -Really?\N-Really. Now get back to work. Later, while we were learning\Nabout the Pismo Beach disaster I decided I needed\Na complete makeover. Except this time I'd make over my soul. But what makes somebody\Na better person? And then I realized all my friends\Nwere really good in different ways. Like Christian, he always wants things\Nto be beautiful and interesting. Or Dionne and Murray, when they think no one is watching,\Nare so considerate of each other. And poor Miss Geist always trying to get us involved,\Nno matter how much we resist. Oh, this is just... That doesn't even show, every\Nsingle possession, every memory everything you've had your whole life,\Ngone in a second. Can you imagine\Nwhat that must feel like? -Elton?\N-Can l use the pass? Yeah. We'll be collecting blankets,\Ndisposable diapers, canned goods. Miss Geist? -Cher?\N-l want to help. That would be wonderful. I felt better already. -Daddy?\N-What? You didn't like that red caviar, did you? What's she talking about? Cher, what are you doing? l'm captain\Nof the Pismo Beach disaster relief. l don't think they need your skis. Daddy, some people lost\Nall their belongings. Don't you think\Nthat includes athletic equipment? This is your influence, Josh? Hey, come here, sign up. lt's gonna be really fun. And these beans, it's so great. -Shall l leave the blanket here?\N-No. Could you please bring it to bedding? -Sure.\N-Yes, thank you very much. Miss Geist, l need more boxes,\Nthey're all filled up. Already? Great! l divided them into entrées\Nand appetizers. Okay. l'll have them picked up. Okay. -Hey.\N-Proper. This is really decent of you, Travis. Sure. l wasn't sure about that. l don't need it anymore, but far be it\Nfrom me to deny anyone else. l wanted to tell you something. -l'm sorry about your shoes.\N-What shoes? The red ones with the strappy thing. Those are so last season.\NWhat even made you think of them? lt's one of my steps.\NSee, l joined this club and they have all these steps.\NThere's like... Twelve? Yeah, 1 2. How'd you know? Wild guess. Wow, that's a good guess. Also, here. ASL? Amateur Skateboarding League. This clarity thing, it's brought me to\Na whole new level and my skating is... You got to see it.\NWould you come Saturday? Sure. Cool. Well, l guess, kitchenware? That's where l used to keep it. -Hi.\N-Hi. Cher, can l talk to you a minute? Sure. l have been in agony the past week and l can't even believe\Nthat l went off the way l did. No, l have been going down\Na shame spiral. l cannot even believe l was so\Nunsupportive of your feelings for Josh. No, you are entitled to your own opinion,\Nall right? l'm the tard here. Cher, you've been nothing\Nbut super-duper nice to me. Not even. lf it wasn't for me you wouldn't even have liked\Nthat loser, Elton. l'm so sorry, Tai. Cher, l'm really sorry. Oh, shit,\Nnow l'm gonna go ahead and cry. -Let's never fight again, okay?\N-Oh, totally. Next up, Number 14,\NTravis Birkenstock. There he is, he waved to you. All right, Travis! l had no idea he was so motivated. Oh, l did. When I saw the sparks\Nbetween Tai and Travis I knew Josh was out of the picture. You look like Pippi Longstocking. You look like Forrest Gump. Who's Pippi Longstocking? Someone Mel Gibson never played. You're funny. What happened to the August 28 files? What? Mel wanted them tonight.\NThere were twice as many. He's gonna go ballistic.\NWhere are they? l think l checked them\Nfor the September 3 conversations. -What?\N-Where'd you put them? l divided them into two piles. ls that wrong? My God! l have to redo all that.\NWhat are you, some kind of idiot? Hey, she didn't know. She just set us back a day. Who cares about the September call?\NNow we're screwed. l'm sorry. Just forget it, okay? Just go back to the mall or something. What's your problem, man?\NShe didn't mean any harm. l'm gonna get killed,\N'cause she's a moron. She's not a moron. lf you were paying attention,\Nit wouldn't have happened. lf you hadn't been playing footsie\Nwith the dumb kid she wouldn't be bothering. What the hell are you talking about? You know exactly what l'm talking about. This is a multi-million dollar lawsuit,\Nnot some excuse for puppy love. We've been working our butts off\Non this case. l'll tell you what, you do whatever you want\Nwith your butts. l'm calling in sick. Did l really ruin Daddy's lawsuit? No. Of course not. Did l set him back? There's so much work to be done\Nand he can't afford to lose that time. Don't worry about it. l'll take care of it. Your father won't lose any time. Can you imagine the nerve of that guy? l mean, making you worry like that. He's the one that screwed up,\Nand then he goes and blames us. l mean, imagine saying we were... you know. That's right.\NYou've been very dedicated to this case. Yeah, it was a good\Nlearning experience, at least for me. l want to be a lawyer. But you, l mean,\Nyou don't need to be doing this. Go out and have fun. Go shopping. You think that's all l do?\Nl'm just a ditz with a credit card? No, that's not what l meant. lt's... You're young and beautiful and... And? And, well, what? You think l'm beautiful? You know... You know you're gorgeous, all right? And popular and... But this is not why l, you know,\Nl come here. This is a good learning experience\Nfor me. You already said that. Mel. l want to help out Mel. He's the only one who cares about me. That's not true. He's not? No. Are you saying you care about me? Josh... Well, you can guess\Nwhat happened next. Therefore... As if! I am only 1 6... and this is California not Kentucky! You may kiss the bride. l know that when l have\Nmy own wedding, l want this, like,\Nthis whole entire floral motif, like very floral garlands... No. When l get married,\Nl'm gonna have a sailor dress but it's gonna be a gown. All my bridesmaids are gonna wear\Nsailor hats. -That sounds so cool.\N-With veils. My God, they're planning\Nour weddings already. Could you all stop all that\N"till death do us part" mumbo-jumbo? -l'm telling you, l'm completely bugging.\N-Jeez, l'm bugging myself. Girls, she's about to throw the bouquet.\NCome on! We got a pool going\Nto see whose girl gets the bouquet. lt's up to $200. lt's in the bag. All right, come on, girls. Over here! l got it!
