<i>I believe we have a choice in this\Nworld about how to tell sad stories.</i> <i>On the one hand,\Nyou can sugarcoat it.</i> <i>The way they do in movies\Nand romance novels...</i> <i>where beautiful people\Nlearn beautiful lessons...</i> <i>where nothing is too messed\Nup that can't be fixed...</i> <i>with an apology\Nand a Peter Gabriel song.</i> <i>I like that version as much\Nas the next girl does,</i> <i>believe me.</i> <i>It's just not the truth.</i> <i>This is the truth.</i> <i>Sorry.</i> <i>Late in the winter\Nof my seventeenth year...</i> <i>my mother decided\Nthat I was depressed.</i> She just eats like a bird,\Nshe barely leaves the house. I am not depressed, Mom. She's reading the same\Nbook over and over. She's depressed. I'm not depressed. <i>The booklets and the websites\Nalways list depression as</i> <i>a side effect of cancer.</i> <i>Depression's not\Na side effect of cancer.</i> <i>It's a side effect of dying.</i> <i>Which is what\Nwas happening to me.</i> I may switch you to Zoloft. Or Lexapro. And twice a day instead of once. Why stop there?\NHmm? Really, just keep them coming. I'm like the Keith Richards\Nof cancer kids. Have you been going to that\Nsupport group I suggested? Yeah, it's not my thing. Support groups\Ncan be a great way for you to connect\Nwith people who are... Who are... What? ...on the same journey. "Journey"? Really? Give it a chance. Who knows, you might even\Nfind it enlightening. All right. Are you guys ready? We are gathered here today literally in the heart of Jesus. We're here with J.C. Who wants to share their\Nstory with the group? I'm Angel. I have acute myeloid leukemia. Sid. Acute lymphoblastic\Nleukemia. Hi, I'm PJ.\NUm, I have neuroblastoma. I'm Patrick. Testicular. <i>I'll spare you the gory\Ndetails of Patrick's ball cancer.</i> <i>Basically, they found it\Nin his nuts...</i> <i>they cut most of it out, and he\Nalmost died, but he didn't die.</i> <i>So now, here he is,\Ndivorced, friendless...</i> <i>living on his parents' couch...</i> <i>exploiting his cancer-tastic\Npast in the heart of Jesus.</i> <i>Literally.</i> <i>To show us that one day,\Nif we 're lucky.</i> .. <i>We could be just like him.</i> Who's next? Hazel? Um... I'm Hazel. Uh, thyroid, originally... but now with\Nquite the impressive satellite colony in my lungs. And how are you doing? <i>Uh, you mean besides\Nthe terminal cancer?</i> All right, I guess. We're here for you, Hazel. Why don't I play another song? <i>Christ is our friend</i> <i>And he'll be there till the end</i> <i>Christ is our friend</i> <i>And he'll be there till the end</i> <i>Christ</i> Hey, sweet pea. So... was it awesome? "Yeah, Mom,\Nit was awesome!" <i>HAZEL". And that was my life.</i> <i>Reality shows.</i> <i>Doctor's appointments.</i> <i>Eight prescription drugs,\Nthree times a day.</i> <i>But worst, worst,\Nworst of all...</i> <i>Support group-</i> - You cannot make me.\N- Of course we can. We're your parents. Come on,\Nwe've been through this. You need to go. You need to make friends,\Nand be a teenager. Mom, if you want me\Nto be a teenager, you don't send me\Nto support group. You gotta get me a fake ID\Nso that I can go to clubs... and drink gimlets and take pot. Uh, you don't "take" pot. Well, that is the kind of thing\NI would know with a fake ID. Can you\Njust get in the car, please? <i>And</i> so <i>I</i> went. <i>Not because I wanted to, or because\NI thought it would help</i> me... <i>but for the same reason\NI did anything these days.</i> <i>To make my parents happy.</i> I really don't understand\Nwhy I can't just drive myself. It's not like you're\Ngonna do anything. You're just gonna sit here\Nand wait again. Of course I'm not. No, I've got stuff to do.\NI'm gonna do errands. Yeah. I love you. I love you, too. Have fun. <i>The only thing worse\Nthan biting it from cancer...</i> <i>is having a kid\Nbite it from cancer.</i> Hey! Make some friends. Oh, sorry. I'll take the stairs.\NNo problem. Thank you. Sorry. My bad. I'm sorry. Oh, my God. <i>So, who would like to start?</i> Does anyone want to start?\NWho wants to kick it off? Go ahead. I'm Beth. I have\Nspindle cell sarcoma. It's been an okay week. Isaac, I know that you're\Nfacing some challenges right now. Do you want to share\Nwith the group? Or maybe your friend, here? No, I'll share. Hey, guys. Uh... Hi, I'm Isaac. I have retinoblastoma. We had surgery on one eye\Nwhen I was younger... so this is a glass eye. And then I'm going in to the\Nhospital to have another surgery... to take out the other eye. So, after that surgery, I'm\Njust gonna be totally blind. But I'm lucky, because I have this\Nbeautiful, smoking hot girlfriend... who's way out of my league.\NMonica. And I have great friends like\NAugustus Waters to help me out. So, that's what's up.\NThanks. We're here for you, Isaac. Thank you. Your turn, Gus. Yeah, sure. Um, I'm Augustus Waters. I'm 18 years old and I had a touch of osteosarcoma\Nabout a year-and-a-half ago. So, I've lost this baby\Nas a result. And, uh, now I'm part\Ncyborg, which is awesome. But, really, I'm just\Nhere at Isaac's request. And how are you feeling, Gus? I'm grand, yeah. I'm on a roller coaster that\Nonly goes up, my friend. Maybe you'd like to share\Nyour fears with the group? My fears? Oblivion. Oblivion? Yeah. You see, I intend to live\Nan extraordinary life. To be remembered. So, I'd say if I have any fears, it would be to not do that. Would anyone else in the\Ngroup like to speak to that? Hazel? Unexpected. I just want to say\Nthat there's gonna come a time when\Nall of us are dead. There was a time before humans and there's gonna\Nbe a time after. It could be tomorrow, it could\Nbe a million years from now. And when it does,\Nthere will be no one left... to remember Cleopatra or\NMuhammad Ali or Mozart... let alone any of us. Oblivion's inevitable. And if that scares you, then\NI suggest you ignore it. God knows it's what\Neveryone else does. Well, that's some good advice. And I like all this because it's\Nreally nice to hear everybody... Thank you.\NMmm-hmm. Always.\NAlways. - Always.\N- Always. "Literally." I thought we were\Nin a church basement... but apparently we were literally\Nin the heart of Jesus. Oh, yeah. What's your name? Hazel. No, what's your full name? Hazel Grace Lancaster. What? I didn't say anything. Why are you looking\Nat me like that? Because you're beautiful. Oh, my God. I enjoy looking\Nat beautiful people. See, I decided a while back... not to deny myself the simpler\Npleasures of existence. Particularly, as you\Nso astutely pointed out, we're all gonna die pretty soon. Okay, well, that's great.\NBut I am not beautiful. Hey, Gus. Hi, Lisa. I like it when you say it first. I like it when you say it first. Okay- Always. Always. What is with the "always"? "Always" is, like, their thing. They'll "always" love\Neach other, and whatnot. They probably texted "always" to each\Nother 14 million times this year. He's got to be hurting her boob. Let's go watch a movie. What?\NHmm? Huh? Um... I'm free later this week,\Nwe could... No, I mean now. You could be an axe murderer. There's always that possibility. Come on, Hazel Grace.\NTake a risk. I don't... Really? That is disgusting. What? What, do you think that\Nthat's cool or something? You just ruined\Nthis whole thing. The whole thing?\NYes, this whole thing! Oh, man. Ugh. And you were\Ndoing really well, too. God! There's always\Na hamartia, isn't there? And yours is even though\Nyou had freaking cancer... you're willing to give\Nmoney to a corporation... for the chance to acquire\Neven more cancer? Let me just tell you that not\Nbeing able to breathe sucks! It totally sucks. "Hamartia"? It's a fatal flaw. Ah, a fatal... Hazel Grace, they don't actually hurt\Nyou unless you light them. Hmm? I've never lit one. It's a metaphor, see? You put the thing that does the\Nkilling right between your teeth... but you never give it\Nthe power to kill you. A metaphor. Hey, sweetheart.\NIs it Top <i>Model</i> time? No. Uh... I've made plans\Nwith Augustus Waters. Whoa! Oh, my God. Ooh! Yeah, I failed my test\Na couple times. You don't say. Actually, the fourth time\NI took the test, it was going about\Nhow this is going. And when it was over... the instructor looks over\Nat me, and she says... "Your driving, while unpleasant,\Nis not technically unsafe." Cancer perk. Total cancer perk. So, tell me about you. Um, I was 13 when they found it. <i>Pretty much\Nworst-case scenario.</i> <i>Thyroid, stage four.</i> <i>Not much they could do.</i> <i>Which didn't stop them,\Nof course.</i> <i>Surgery-</i> <i>Radiation.</i> <i>Chemo.</i> <i>More radiation.</i> <i>All of which worked for a while.</i> <i>But, then stopped working.</i> <i>And then one day, my lungs\Nstarted filling up with water.</i> Nurse!\NWe need a nurse right now! <i>I couldn't breathe.</i> <i>No one could get it\Nunder control.</i> You can let go, sweetie. Don't be afraid. <i>That should have been the end.</i> Oh, my God. <i>But then something\Nstrange happened.</i> <i>The antibiotics kicked in.</i> <i>They drained the fluid\Nfrom my lungs.</i> <i>I got some strength back.</i> <i>Next thing I know, I found\Nmyself in an experimental trial.</i> <i>You know, the ones\Nthat are famous</i> <i>in the Republic of\NCancervania for not working.</i> <i>It's called Phalanxifor.</i> <i>It didn't work in over\N70% of the patients...</i> <i>but for some reason\Nit's been working for me.</i> So, they called it\N"The Miracle." Of course, my lungs still\Nsuck at being lungs... but, theoretically, they could\Ncontinue to suck like this... for, I don't know,\Na while maybe. So, are you back in school? I got my GED, so I'm\Ntaking classes at MCC. Whoa! A college girl! Well, that explains\Nthe aura of sophistication. Oh! Careful! Oops. Welcome to my humble abode. Uh, my folks call them\N"encouragements." Don't ask. Hi, guys! Hey!\NAugustus, hi. New friend? Yeah.\NThis is Hazel Grace. Hey. Oh,\Nit's just "Hazel." How's it going, "Just Hazel"? Hi, Hazel, how are you? Yeah, we're going\Ndownstairs. Bye. Nice to meet you, too. This is it. Augusto World. This is my room. Wow. It's an impressive collection. Yeah, I used to play. Do you mind if I sit down? Yeah. Make yourself\Nat home. <i>Mi casa es tu</i> casa. Sorry, the, um, stairs... ...and the standing... Yeah, I understand. Seriously, are you okay? Yeah, yeah. All right.\NWhat's your story? I already told you. I was diagnosed when I was 13... No, no, no. Not your cancer\Nstory, your real story. Your interests, your hobbies, your passions,\Nyour weird fetishes. "Weird fetishes"? Think of something. The first\Nthing that pops in your head. Something you love. <i>An Imperial Affliction.</i> Okay. What's that? It's a novel. It's my favorite novel. Wait, does it have\Nzombies in it? Zombies? No! Stormtroopers? No, it's not that\Nkind of a book. Okay, what's it about? Uh, cancer. It's about cancer? But not like that.\NTrust me, it's amazing. The author, his name\Nis Peter Van Houten. He's the only person I've ever\Ncome across in my life... who, A, understands what\Nit's like to be dying... but, B, hasn't actually died. Okay- I will read this horrible book\Nwith this very boring title... that does not include\Nzombies or Stormtroopers. And in exchange... ...you will read this. This haunting, yet brilliant novelization\Nof my favorite video game. <i>"Counterinsurgence."</i> Yeah, don't laugh.\NIt's awesome. It's about honor, and sacrifice,\Nand bravery, and heroism. It's about embracing\Nyour destiny, and leaving a mark on the world. Well, thank you. Wait, your hands are so cold. Well, they're not so much cold\Nas just under-oxygenated. Hazel Grace?\NHmm? I love it when you\Ntalk medical to me. That's different. Did he give it to you? By "it," do you mean herpes? Wow. Yes, I did. It's a mother's dream. Hey, don't worry. Oh, my God, Mom.\NI'm not worried. It's not a big deal. Yeah. We just hung out, it's not like\NI'm waiting for him to call me. <i>- Is that</i> what... <i>?</i>\NYeah- Because I thought\Nthose were peppers. Today, in China, International Goji Berry Day. Isn't that great? I like the color. Mmm-hmm. This is the dry.\NUh-huh. Very good. They're good, right?\NMmm-hmm. So, do they eat a lot of goji\Nberries on Goji Berry Day? I did something\Nwith the dessert... just to try to keep\Nthe goji berry theme going. Because they're\Nan amazing antioxidant. Well, I like it. We should do it every year. Every year.\NWe should do it every year. I know. I really do like these. Honey, would you like\Nto be excused? What? Hazel Grace. <i>Welcome</i> to <i>the sweet torture of\Nreading An Imperial Affliction.</i> <i>But now I'm\Nbreaking all the rules!</i> Are you okay? <i>And now\NI'm breaking all the rules</i> Uh... Me? Yeah,\NI am excellent. I am, however,\Nwith Isaac, and... Isaac, does Support Group Hazel\Nmake this better or worse? <i>I've been wasting all my time</i> Isaac! Focus on me. <i>Been wasting all my time</i> How fast can you get here? Um... <i>Great. Well,\Nthe door's open.</i> I gotta run. Bye. Hello? Hazel. Isaac, Hazel Grace from the\NSupport Group is here. - Hi.\N- Hi. Uh...\NA gentle reminder... Isaac's in the midst of a\Npsychotic episode right now. You look really nice,\Nby the way. I like this color on you. Thank you. Isaac. Isaac, Hazel's here. Hey, Isaac. Hey, Hazel. How you doing? I'm doing okay. It seems Isaac and Monica are\Nno longer a going concern. Oh, Isaac, I'm so sorry. Do you want to talk about it? No, I just want to cry\Nand play video games. However, you know, it doesn't\Nhurt to talk to him... if you have any sage words\Nof feminine advice. I actually think that his\Nresponse is fairly appropriate. "Pain demands to be felt." You're quoting my book. She said she wanted to break up\Nwith me before the surgery... because she couldn't handle it. I'm about to lose my eyesight,\Nand she can't handle it. I kept saying "always" to her.\NLike, "Always." And she kept talking over me and not saying it back, and... It was like I was gone\Nalready, you know? You know, sometimes... people don't understand\Nthe promises that they're making\Nwhen they make them. I know, but... I feel like such a loser. I still have her necklace on. Take it off. Dude, take that off. Yeah. Here we go, man.\NHere we go. I just want to kick something. Don't hit that, don't hit that. Uh... Hit this.\NSorry. I've been wanting to call\Nyou for a few days now... but I've been waiting\Nuntil I could form a coherent thought about\NAn Imperial Affliction. One second. Isaac. Pillows don't break. You need to break something. Try this. The trophy?\NYeah. Are you sure? I've been looking for a way to tell\Nmy father I kind of hate basketball. Go to town! Always! <i>An Imperial Affliction.</i> Yes. I'm so glad\Nthat you liked it. Yes, I did.\NBut the ending. I know.\NIt is rather abrupt. "Rather abrupt"? Are you kidding?\NIt's evil! I mean, I understand\Nthat she dies... but there's an unwritten\Ncontract between author and... Gus?\NYeah? Cool?\NSure. Between author and reader. And I feel like ending your book\Nin the middle of a sentence... violates that contract,\Ndon't you think? Okay, yes. I know what you mean... but, to be completely honest, I think it's just so truthful. You just die in\Nthe middle of life. You die in the middle\Nof a sentence. And, I don't know... But I really would like to know what happens to everyone\Nafter Anna dies. Like Anna's mother. Yes, and the Dutch Tulip Man. And Sisyphus the Hamster. Yes! Have you tried contacting\Nthis Peter Van Houten fellow? I've written him\Nso many letters, but he's never responded. Apparently, he moved\Nto Amsterdam and became a recluse, and... Shame.\NYeah. Isaac“. You feeling better, buddy? That's the thing about pain. It demands to be felt. I'll help you clean this up. Hazel Grace. Augustus Waters. I cannot stop thinking\Nabout this goddamn book. You're welcome. However, we do need closure,\Ndon't you think? That is exactly\Nwhat I was asking Van Houten for in my letters. But he never responded. Um, nope. "Dear Mr. Waters... "I am writing to thank you for\Nyour electronic correspondence. "I am grateful to anyone\Nwho sets aside the time... <i>"to read my book."</i> Augustus? <i>Yes?</i> What are you doing? <i>I may have found...</i> Van Houten's assistant,\Nemailed her. Augustus! She may have forwarded\Nthat email on to Van Houten. <i>Shall I continue?</i> Oh, my God.\NYeah, go, go, go! "I am particularly\Nindebted to you, sir." Hazel Grace,\Nhe just called me "sir." Augustus, keep reading,\Nkeep reading! "Both for your kind words about\NAn Imperial Affliction... "and for taking the time... <i>"to tell me that the book, and\Nhere I quote you directly...</i> <i>"'meant a great deal to you and\Nyour friend Hazel Grace.".</i> <i>You did not!\NYou did not!</i> You did not, you did not! <i>Of course I did.</i> "To answer your question, no, I have\Nnot written anything else, nor will I. <i>"I do not feel like continuing to\Nshare my thoughts with readers...</i> <i>"would benefit\Neither them or me.</i> <i>"However, thank you...</i> "for your generous email. "Yours most sincerely,\NPeter Van Houten." So, yeah, that just happened. Oh, my God. I've been trying to tell\Nyou, I'm kind of awesome. Do you think that I... Check your inbox. Oh, my God. Oh, my God, Augustus. I'm freaking out.\NI'm freaking out. <i>Dear Mr. Peter Van Houten,</i> <i>my name is Hazel\NGrace Lancaster.</i> <i>My friend Augustus Waters...</i> <i>who read your book\Nat my recommendation...</i> <i>just received an email\Nfrom you at this address.</i> <i>I hope you will not mind that\Nhe shared that email with me.</i> <i>I was wondering if you wouldn't mind\Nanswering a few questions I have...</i> <i>about what happens\Nafter the end of the book.</i> <i>Specifically the following.</i> <i>Does Anna's mom marry\Nthe Dutch Tulip Man?</i> <i>And is the Dutch Tulip Man\Nup to something...</i> <i>or is he just\Ncompletely misunderstood?</i> <i>Lastly, I was hoping you could shed\Nsome light on Sisyphus the Hamster.</i> <i>These questions have\Nhaunted me for years...</i> <i>and I don't know how long I have\Nleft to get answers to them.</i> <i>I know that these are not\Nimportant literary questions...</i> "and that your book is full of\Nimportant literary questions... "but I would just\Nreally like to know. <i>"And, of course, if you ever do\Ndecide to write anything else...</i> "I would love to read it. "Frankly, I'd read\Nyour grocery lists. "Yours, with great admiration,\NHazel Grace Lancaster." <i>Not bad.</i> You think? Yeah, I mean,\Nit's a bit pretentious... <i>but then again, Van Houten\Nuses words like "tendentious"</i> and "Bacchanalia, <i>"</i> so... I think he'll like it. Is it really 1:00 AM? <i>Is it?</i> Yeah, I guess it is. I should probably go to sleep. Okay- Okay- Okay- Okay- Perhaps "okay"\Nwill be our "always." Okay- Oh, my God. "Dear Ms. Lancaster... "I cannot answer your questions,\Nat least not in writing... "because to do so\Nwould constitute a sequel... "which you might publish or\Notherwise share on the internet. "Not that I don't trust you,\Nbut how could I trust you? "I barely know you. "Should ever you find\Nyourself in Amsterdam, "do pay a visit\Nat your leisure." What? "Yours most sincerely,\NPeter Van Houten." Oh, my God! What is this life? Hazel? Mom!\NHazel, what's wrong? Mom, look at this. Come here.\NCome here, come here. Look. What?\NYeah. Peter Van Houten! Look what he said! "Should ever you find\Nyourself in Amsterdam"! I have to go! That's incredible. He invited us to Amsterdam. Amsterdam! Wow!\NCan We go? I mean, do you think\Nwe could actually go? I mean, Amsterdam! I want you to have everything\Nyou want in the world. But we don't have\Nthe money, you know? Just getting all the\Nequipment over there. How do we do that? Yeah, duh. I'm sorry. Hey, you, I am so sorry. It's okay. Why don't you just ask the Genies?\NUse your wish. I already used it.\NPre-Miracle. What'd you use it on? Not Disney. Hazel Grace, you did not\Ngo to Disney World. You did not use your last dying wish...\NI was 13. ...to go to Disney World. And Epcot Center. Oh, my God. It was actually\Na really fun trip! That's the saddest thing\NI've ever heard. I met Goofy! Now I'm just embarrassed. Why are you embarrassed? I can't believe I have a crush on\Na girl with such cliche wishes. Terrible. You coming? <i>The most important\Nthing in any MRI...</i> <i>is to lie completely still.</i> <i>But that day,\Nit was almost impossible.</i> Hey, Gus!\NHow are you? Hi, Mrs. Lancaster. Hey. Rik Smits jersey? Yeah, it is indeed.\NI loved that guy. I'm Augustus Waters. Nice to meet you.\NI'm Michael. It's good to see you.\NHi, Mrs. Lancaster. Good to see you. Hi, Hazel Grace. Hi. How would you like to go\Non a picnic with me? Um, I would love to go\Non a picnic with you. Shall we? No.\NLet me... I smell like hospital,\Nso I should just change. So, uh... you're a survivor yourself, huh? Yeah. I didn't cut this fellow\Noff for the hell of it. Although it does make an\Nexcellent weight-loss strategy. Legs are very heavy. How's your health now? It's great.\NNEC for 14 months. Really?\NYeah. That's fantastic.\NYeah. I'm very lucky. Hey, listen, Gus. You have to understand,\NHazel's still pretty sick. And she will be\Nthe rest of her life. And she's gonna want to\Nkeep up with you. She's that kind of girl. But\Nthe truth is, her lungs... Ready, Gus? Yeah. All right.\NSee you soon. All right. Oh! Such a beautiful day. Yeah. Is this where you take all\Nof your romantic conquests? Every last one of them. That's probably why\NI'm still a virgin. You are not still a virgin. Are you really? Let me show you something. See this circle? That is a circle of virgins. Uh-huh. And this... is 18-year-old dudes\Nwith one leg. Oh...\NSo, yeah. <i>Funky Bones by\NJeep Van Lieshout.</i> He sounds quite Dutch. And he is. Much like Rik Smits. And tulips. Sandwich? Let me guess. Dutch cheese and tomato. Sorry, the tomatoes are Mexican. How dare you! Hmm. How cool is this? They're using a skeleton\Nas a playground. Think about that. You do love your symbols. Speaking of which,\Nyou're probably wondering... why you're sitting here eating\Na bad cheese sandwich... and drinking orange juice with\Na guy in a Rik Smits jersey. It actually has crossed my mind. Well, Hazel Grace,\Nlike so many before you... and listen, I say this with\Nthe utmost of affection... you used your wish moronically. Okay, we've been through this.\NI was 13. Hush! lam in the midst\Nof a grand soliloquy, here. You were young,\Nimpressionable... the Grim Reaper staring\Nyou right in the face... and it led you to rush into making\Na wish you didn't really want. But, how could\Nlittle Hazel Grace, having never read\NAn Imperial Affliction... know that her one true wish was\Nto visit Mr. Peter Van Houten... in his Amsterdam exile. But I didn't save it, so... It's a good thing I saved mine. So, you're saying... I'm not gonna give you my\Nwish or anything, Hazel. If that's what you're thinking. However... I, too, have an interest in meeting\Nthis Mr. Peter Van Houten... and I don't really think\Nit would make much sense... to meet him without the\Ngirl who introduced me to the book\Nin the first place... now, would it? So I talked to the Genies,\Nand they're all for it. We leave in a month. No. Mmm-hmm. Oh, my God. Oh, my God! Augustus! Thank you! Apparently, they... I don't know\Nif they do this that often, but they're willing to\Nbring me, too, and... That's incredible. Hazel, that's so beautiful. I know. And a little insane. Oh, it's super insane. It's...\NIt's... It's... It's crazy! Well...\NIt's Amsterdam! He just met you... I know! ...and he's\Ngiving you his wish. Well, we're sharing the wish. We're... I\Nmean, he... He... Yeah. We're sharing it. That's sweet. Unless... What? Is he your boyfriend?\NIs that... Stop it! Do not...\NHe is not my... Mom, focus,\Nwe're talking about Amsterdam. I like him so much. I...\NStop. Pay attention.\NPlease! Can I go? Right, as your mom,\NI love this idea. And I... I think we\Nshould talk to Dr. Maria. Okay- I don't know. But you said that\Nthe PET scan was encouraging. Well, the PET scan\Nis encouraging, but we don't know how long\Nit will stay that way. Okay, I'm not seeking political asylum.\NIt's a few days. It's a vacation! It's true.\NWhat if you get sick? In a foreign country? They have doctors in\NAmsterdam. And cancer. Well, not all cancers are alike, and\Nyours is particularly unusual, Hazel. The only way I could ever\Nauthorize a trip like this would be if someone\Nfamiliar with your case... What if my mom came? Wait, what? What if you came? I'm... I'm sure the Genies would\Nhook it up. They're loaded. That just might work. <i>HAZEL".\NAnd then this happened.</i> Hey- Hi. Hey.\NYou're okay. So, what happened? The usual. Fluid in the lungs\Npreventing oxygenation. They put a tube in. They drained a liter\Nand a half last night. The good news is... no tumor growth. No new tumors in your body. We're so relieved. This is just a thing, Hazel. It's a thing we can live with. Mr. Lancaster. How's she doing? Better. Yeah, thank you.\NMuch, much better. Uh, they won't let me in.\NIt's family only. Yeah, sorry. Yeah, I get it. Um... Could you just\Ntell her I was here? Yeah, of course.\NOf course I will. Okay. Gus, listen, why\Ndon't you go home? Get some rest. Okay- Normally, the tumors\Nstart resisting the treatment... and that hasn't happened here... Yet. On the other hand... the drug may be\Nworsening the edema. The truth is... very few people have been on\NPhalanxifor as long as Hazel has. We really don't know\Nthe long-term effects. What we're trying to do is\Nprevent endothelial growth... which, when overexpressed, can\Ncontribute to disease, decay... vascular inhibition... and the spread of the tumors we're working so hard\Nto eradicate. The survival rate of patients\Nwith severe endothelial growth... decreases exponentially the\Nmore the condition advances. You can let go, sweetie. Don't be afraid. Oh, my God. I'm not gonna be a mom anymore. I have a question. Yes, Hazel? Can I still go to Amsterdam? That would not be wise\Nat this juncture. Why not? ls there any way we\Ncan make that trip happen? It would increase some risks. But so does going to the mall. Yes, but an airplane? But they have oxygen\Non airplanes. You're stage four. This is an opportunity\Nthat I may never get again. Even If the medication is working, I\Ndon't understand why I can't... Perhaps there's a scenario... No. I don't know any other\Nway to say this, Hazel. You're just too sick. I'm sorry. MICHAEL; Hello? Yeah, just a sec. Hi. Gus... again. Sorry, she's asleep. Yeah. Uh, okay. All right. Bye-bye. I know what you're thinking. It's not fair to him. It's not. He doesn't need this\Nin his life. Nobody does. A lot more trouble\Nthan it's worth. No, you're right. Your mom and I were just\Nsaying the same thing. I mean, it could be time we\Ntossed you out on the street. Drop you off in an orphanage\Nsomewhere, make you their problem. I'm serious. We're not sentimental people. Hazel Grace. Hi, Augustus. <i>Are you okay?</i> No. <i>What's the matter?</i> <i>Talk to me.</i> I don't know. Everything. I want to go to Amsterdam, Gus. And I want Van Houten to tell us what happens after his book. I also don't really want\Nthis particular life. I mean, it's really\Njust the sky. The sky is making me sad. And there's this pathetic\Nold swing set... that my dad built for me when\NI was a kid and... It's just everything, I guess. <i>Well, I demand to see this\Nswing set of tears.</i> I do see your point. This is one sad swing set. Hazel Grace,\NI hope you realize... that you trying to\Nkeep your distance from me in no way lessens\Nmy affection for you. All your efforts to keep me\Nfrom you are gonna fail. Look. Uh... I like you. And I like hanging out\Nwith you and everything... but I can't let this\Ngo on any further. Why not? Because I don't\Nwant to hurt you. I wouldn't mind. No, you don't understand.\NI do understand. You don't understand. I know what\Nyou're trying to say. Hazel, I'm saying\NI wouldn't mind. It'd be a privilege to have\Nmy heart broken by you. Gus, I'm a grenade. One day I'm gonna explode... and I'm gonna obliterate\Neverything in my wake and... I don't know, I feel like\Nit's my responsibility... to minimize the casualties. A grenade? I mean, that's why I\Ndon't have a hamster. Well, we gotta do something\Nabout this frickin' swing set. Okay- "Swing set needs home." "Desperately lonely swing set "needs loving home." "Lonely, vaguely\Npedophilia swing set "seeks the butts of children." No. No. No? No? I like it. That's why. In case you're wondering, that's\Nwhy I like you, Hazel Grace. You're just so busy\Nbeing you, you have no idea how utterly\Nunprecedented you are. You can't say stuff like that. What? That's howl\Nspeak to all my friends. I know, I know. Friends. Friends. Friends! You can't do that! "Dear Hazel, received word via\Nthe Genies that you will... "you'll be visiting us\Nwith Augustus Waters "and your mother\Non the fourth." Mom? Yeah? Mom! What's wrong? Sorry. No, I was just taking a bath. Did you email the Genies to tell\Nthem that the trip was off? Because Van Houten's\Nassistant just emailed me... and she said that she\Nthinks we're still coming. What? I was supposed to tell you\Nwith your dad. Mom. We're going to Amsterdam. You're se-...\NWe're going to Amsterdam? We're going to Amsterdam. We figured the whole thing out.\NWe're going. Doctor Maria, everybody knows. But only for three days, not six.\NOh, my God. But everything. An\Noncologist is set there. Everything.\NWe're just so good. I love you. I love you so much. I love you. Here, sit down.\NWe're going to Amsterdam. We're going to Amsterdam. We're going to Amsterdam.\NYou can come talk to me. You've got a phone call to make. Call him! Okay, lungs, you keep your\Nshit together for one week. You got it?\NOne more week. Oh. Oh, wait,\Nthe food. What did you forget? Do you have my passport? Yeah, I've got it. It's like I said\Nto the Genies... "I travel in style,\Nor I don't travel at all." Mom, we're going to Amsterdam! We are going to\NAmsterdam, right now. Hello, Lancasters. Gus. Hey.\NNice to see you. I'll take that, sir. Gus, you're so inventive! Okay, Hazel Grace? Okay! What's in your nose? Jackie! I'm really sorry about that. No, it's totally fine. It's called a "cannula."\NAnd it helps me breathe. See this little\Nfriend right here? He feeds oxygen\Nthrough your tube. Will it help me breath, too? Maybe. Do you want to try it? Okay- Come here. There ya go. It tickles! Wow, yeah, that's something. I think I'm breathing better. I would love to give it to you, but I kind of\Ncould use the help. Thanks for letting me try it.\NYou're welcome. All right, Jackie, let's go. Thank you. Take care.\NBye. <i>Flight 1721 is now prepared to\Nbegin boarding at gate 46...</i> I think that's us.\NThat's us. We are going to Amsterdam! Oh, my God. Come on, help me. What, are they wet?\NWet hands. I'm sorry about that. Gross!\NGet outta here! Stop it! Have you never been\Non a plane before? No. It's exciting. Sir?\NUh-huh? There's no smoking\Non this plane. Or any plane. I don't smoke. Yeah, it's just a metaphor. He puts the killing thing\Nin his mouth... but he doesn't actually give\Nit the power to kill him. Well, that metaphor, it's\Nprohibited on today's flight. <i>Flight attendants,\Nprepare for take off, please.</i> Thanks. Okay? Gus, this is what it's like\Nto drive in a car with you. Ha-ha-ha-ha... Oh... Oh! Oh, my God, we're flying. We're flying! Look at the ground! Look. Nothing has ever looked like\Nthis in all of human history! Look at the cars.\NThey're like... You two are so adorable. We're just friends. Well, she is, I'm not. Oh, my! Whoa! <i>Get away from her, you bitch!</i> Look at this, Hazel. This is so crazy. Whoa. What? Look at the stained glass. It's amazing. Oh, I'm gonna check us in. We better get you dressed... because you have reservations\Nfor two tonight, for dinner at Oranjee.\NOh. And it says, "Enjoy.\NMr. Peter Van Houten." So, I looked it up\Nand it sounds amazing. The guide book says it's\Nfancy and very romantic. Right. Fancy... Oh, God. But, okay, what... ...will you wear? Is that for me? Oh, my God.\NIt's so beautiful. I'm just saying. You're just saying? What, you're saying\Nthat you're totally fine... with your teenage daughter running\Nfree with an older boy... in a city that's famous\Nfor its vice and debauchery is\Ntotally fine with you? Yeah, that's pretty much\Nexactly what I'm saying. Gus! Oh, you look so handsome! Thank you, ma'am.\NWow. Hazel, Gus is here... looking incredible! I hear this restaurant\Nis unbelievable. Wow. What? You look gorgeous. Thanks. Whoa! Wow. This is it. Oranjee.\NYeah, this is it. Oh, yeah. Your table,\NMr. and Mrs. Waters. Thank you. Thanks, Gus. You are very welcome. The champagne\Nis our gift. Enjoy. Thank you. Good evening. <i>Voilà.</i> Okay, Okay? Whoa. That is amazing. Do you know what\NDom Pérignon said after he invented champagne? "Come quickly," he said.\N"I'm tasting the stars." Welcome to Oranjee. Would you like a menu, or will\Nyou have the chef's choice? Chef's choice sounds wonderful. - Mmm.\N- And, sir, um... something tells me we're gonna\Nneed a little bit more of this. We have bottled all the\Nstars for you this evening, my young friends. - Ooh!\N- I think that's ours. Dragon carrot\Nrisotto for the lady. Thank you. And for the gentleman. Thank you.\NEnjoy. Mmm. I want this dragon carrot\Nrisotto to become a person... so that I can take it\Nto Vegas and marry it. I like your suit. Thank you. It's the first\Ntime I've ever worn it. That's not the suit\Nyou wear to funerals? No. That one is not\Nnearly this nice. When I first got sick... they told me I had an 85 percent\Nchance of being cancer-free. Great odds. But that meant a year of\Ntorture, the loss of my leg... and, still, a 15 percent\Nchance it might fail. Just before the surgery... I asked my parents if I could\Nbuy a really nice suit. So, it's your death suit. That's what it is. I have one of those. I got it\Nfor my fifteenth birthday. A dress. I don't necessarily think I'd\Nwear it on a date, though. So, we're on a date? Hey, you watch it. We are Mr.\NAnd Mrs. Waters. Oh. That's just because\Nshe can't speak English. We should be, though, if they ask.\NYou know? Remember what you\Nsaid about Vegas? Yeah. Do you think I could\Njoin in on that deal? God? Maybe. How about angels? Mmm, no. Afterlife?\NMmm... No. Well, maybe.\NI don't know. I guess I wouldn't go\Nas far as to say "no"... but I would like some evidence. What about you? Absolutely.\NReally? I mean, not like a heaven where\Nyou ride on a unicorn all day... and live in a mansion\Nmade of clouds... but yes, I definitely\Nbelieve in something. I mean, otherwise... what's the point? Maybe there is no point. I won't accept that. I am in love with you. You heard me. Augustus... I am in love with you. And I know that love is just\Na shout into the void... and that oblivion is inevitable. And that we're all doomed... and that one day... all of our labors\Nwill be returned to dust. And I know that\Nthe sun will swallow the only Earth\Nwe will ever have. And I am in love with you. Sorry. More stars? No, thank you. I think we'll just\Nhave the check. No, sir. Your meal has been paid\Nby Mr. Van Houten. What? I don't really get that shirt. Mmm. But Van Houten will get it. There are, like, fifty Magritte\Nreferences in An Imperial Affliction. "This is not a pipe." But it is a pipe. But it's not. It is a drawing of a pipe. See? A drawing of a thing\Nis not the thing itself. Nor is a T-shirt of a drawing\Nof a thing, the thing itself. Hey, you. When did you get so grown up? Who's ready for some answers? Me! This is it. I'm so excited,\NI can barely breathe. As opposed to normal? Get out of here. Lidewij? Hi!\NHi, I'm Augustus. Lidewij.\NHazel. Please, come in. Thank you. Peter! They're here! Who the hell is "they," Lidewij? They are Augustus and Hazel... the young fans with whom\Nyou've been corresponding. The Americans? You invited them. Please, come in. You know\Nwhy I left America, Lidewij. To never have to\Nencounter Americans. You're American. Incurably so. Get rid of them. I will not do this, Peter. Please, be nice. Come in, please. Sorry, let me\Nclear this for you. Thank you. Which of you is Augustus Waters? I am. And that's Hazel. Mr. Van Houten, thank you so\Nmuch for writing back to us. Clearly an error in judgment. Yours are the first missives\Nto which I've replied, and look where it got me. Scotch? Uh... No, thank you. Just me, then, Lidewij. Another scotch and soda, please. Perhaps some\Nbreakfast first, Peter? She thinks I have\Na drinking problem. I also think the Earth is round. So, you like my book. We love your book.\NYeah. We love it. Augustus... He made his wish meeting\Nyou so that we could talk. - No pressure.\N- Yeah. Did you dress\Nlike her on purpose? Kind of. And, incidentally, sir,\Nwe both really wanted to thank you\Nfor dinner last night. And for the champagne. It was amazing. It was magical. We bought them\Ndinner last night? It was our pleasure. You've come a long way. What can I do for you? We have some questions... obviously, about what happens\Nat the end of your book. Uh, specifically to those\Nwho Anna leaves behind. Like her mom,\Nthe Dutch Tulip Man... How familiar are you\Nwith Swedish hip-hop? I would say, limited. Uh, Lidewij, play\NBomfalleralla immediately. Okay- We don't speak Swedish, sir. Who the hell speaks Swedish? The important thing is not what\Nnonsense the voices are saying... but what the voices are feeling. Are you messing with us? Like, is this some\Nsort of performance? Gus, sit down. All right, so at the end\Nof the book, Anna's... Let's imagine\Nyou're racing a tortoise. The tortoise has\Na ten-yard head start. In the time it takes you\Nto run ten yards... the tortoise has moved maybe\None yard, and so on, forever. You're faster than the tortoise, but you can never\Ncatch him, you see? You can only decrease his lead. Now, certainly, you can\Nrun past the tortoise... as long as you don't contemplate\Nthe mechanics involved. But the question\Nof "how?" turns out to be\Nso complicated... that no one really solved it... until Cantor's proof\Nthat some infinities are bigger than\Nother infinities. I assume that answers\Nyour question. Hazel, I'm sorry. I have\Nno idea what's going on. Yet you seemed so intelligent\Nin print, Mr. Waters. Has the cancer found its\Nway into your brain? Peter. Can we, for one second,\Njust focus on Anna? Please? I understand that the story ends in the middle of a sentence... because she dies, or that she\Nbecomes too sick to continue... I am not interested\Nin talking about that book. But that doesn't mean that her family\Nand friends don't have a future, right? Right? I said I'm not interested. But you promised! Nothing happens!\NThey're fiction! They cease to exist the\Nmoment the novel ends. But they can't! I get it in a literary sense\Nor whatever, but... I can't do this, Lidewij. It's impossible\Nnot to imagine what... I will not indulge\Nyour childish whims. I refuse to pity\Nyou in the manner in which you are accustomed. I do not want your pity! VAN\NOf course you do! Like all sick kids, your\Nexistence depends on it. You are fated to live\Nout your days... Peter! ...as the child you\Nwere when diagnosed. A child who believes there is\Na life after a novel ends. And we as adults, we pity this. So, we pay for your treatments,\Nyour oxygen machines. Peter, that's enough. You are a side-effect\Nto an evolutionary process... that cares little\Nfor individual lives. You are a failed\Nexperiment in mutation. Listen, douchepants... there is nothing that you're gonna\Ntell me about my disease... that I don't already know. I came here for one thing\Nand one thing only. That is for you\Nto tell me what happens at the end of this goddamn book! I can't tell you. Bullshit!\NI can't. Then make something up! I want you to leave. Have you ever stopped\Nto ask yourself... why you care so much\Nabout your silly questions? Oh, go fuck yourself. Hey, it's okay. It's okay. I'll write you a sequel. All right?\NI'll write you a sequel. It'll be better than any piece of\Nshit that drunk guy could write. It'll have blood, and\Nguts, and sacrifice. You'll love it. So sorry that I spent your\Nwish on that asshole. No, you did not spend it on him.\NYou spent it on us. Hazel and Augustus! I'm very sorry. Circumstance has made him cruel. I thought meeting you\Nwould help him... that he could see that his\Nwork has shaped real lives. But... I'm very sorry. Perhaps we can do\Nsome sightseeing? Have you been to\Nthe Anne Frank house? I'm not going anywhere\Nwith that man. No. He is not invited. I'm afraid there's no elevator. Oh. That's all right. There are many stairs. Steep stairs.\NI can do it. Hazel, we don't have to...\NI can do it. Let's go. <i>Frank's family\Ncame from Frankfurt, in Germany.</i> <i>Anne Frank's diary would\Nbecome world famous.</i> <i>It's difficult\Nin times like these.</i> <i>It's a wonder I haven't\Nabandoned all my ideals.</i> <i>They seem so absurd\Nand impractical...</i> <i>yet I cling to them\Nbecause I still believe...</i> <i>in spite of everything, that\Npeople are truly good at heart.</i> <i>It's utterly impossible\Nfor me to build my life...</i> Shall we? - Yeah.\N- Yeah. Hazel, I'll carry it\Nif you want. I got it. Wow. So this is the actual bookcase\Nthat hid the Frank family. Whoa. I got it. Thank you. <i>We're much too young\Nto deal with these problems...</i> <i>but they keep thrusting\Nthemselves on</i> us... <i>until, finally, we're forced\Nto think up a solution.</i> You okay, Hazel? Yeah. Don't worry, take your time. Sorry. Yeah? Yeah. <i>And yet,\Nwhen I look up at the sky...</i> <i>I somehow feel that everything\Nwill change for the better.</i> <i>That this cruelty,\Ntoo, will end.</i> You Okay? Yeah. Hazel, I think that's enough. You don't need...\NYou know? Uh-huh. I got this. <i>All is as it should be.</i> <i>God wishes to see people happy.</i> <i>Where there is hope...\NHazel.</i> <i>...there is life.</i> Well done.\NYeah. You Okay? Yeah. This is it, look. All right? Oh, yeah.\NOh, my God. Thanks. The only member of the\NFrank family to survive was Otto. Anne's father. <i>At</i> such moments... <i>...I can't think about\Nthe misery...</i> <i>but about the beauty\Nthat still remains.</i> <i>Try to recapture the\Nhappiness within yourself.</i> <i>Think of all the beauty\Nin everything around you...</i> <i>and be happy.</i> Bravo. <i>I fell in love with\Nhim the way you fall asleep.</i> <i>Slowly, and then all at once.</i> It just sort of ends right above\Nwhere the knee would be... and tapers off. What? My leg. You know, just so\Nyou're prepared. Gus... get over yourself. Wait. I can't, it's stuck. I love you so\Nmuch, Augustus Waters. I love you too, Hazel Grace. So, so much. Augustus, I can't breathe. It's okay. Hazel. You're so beautiful. Stop. No, you're so beautiful. I'm so lucky. I'm so lucky. <i>Oh, my God.</i> I can't believe you\Ncalled him "douchepants." - I know!\N- You did? How did you come up with that? I don't know, it just came out. I was so angry. What a monster. Mom, it was awful. Then what happened? We went to Anne Frank House. Oh, you did? It was really awesome.\NWas that incredible? It was so awesome. And after that? We just walked around. That sounds lovely. Oh, my gosh, we probably still have\Na few hours, right? Should we go to\Nthe Van Gogh Museum? Whatever you want. Probably don't have time\Nto do everything, but... You're just gonna have\Nto come back, is all. Could you just not be\Nridiculous right now, please? Hazel, I'm not being ridiculous. I'm being positive. Mrs. Lancaster? Yeah? Do you think Hazel and I can\Njust have a little time alone? Sure, Gus. Um, lam gonna run to the room... and be ready whenever you\Nguys want to do something. Want to go for a walk? What is it? Just before you went into the\Nhospital, there was this... I felt an ache in my hip. So, I had a PET scan... and it lit up like\Na Christmas tree. The lining of my chest\Nand my liver... Everywhere. I'm sorry. I should've told you. It's so unfair. Apparently, the world is not\Na wish-granting factory. Hey, listen. Don't you worry about me,\NHazel Grace, okay? I'm gonna find a way\Nto hang around here and annoy you for a long time. Are you in pain? No. I'm okay. You're okay? Okay- I don't suppose you can\Njust forget about this? You know, just treat\Nme like I'm not dying. I don't think you're\Ndying, Augustus. You've just got\Na touch of cancer. Would it be\Nabsolutely ludicrous... if we just made out? Right now? Probably. On... So how are your eyes, Isaac? They're good. They're not in my head,\Nis the only problem. Besides that... Well, um, it appears my entire\Nbody's made out of cancer now. So, sorry to\None-up you, dude. Did you, uh...\Nwrite his eulogy yet? Dude.\NWhat? What? I haven't told\Nher yet, Isaac. What are you talking about? Oh. Sorry. Augustus? I need speakers at my funeral. So, I was hoping\Nthat you and Isaac, but mostly you... would be, um, kind enough\Nto whip something up. I would love to do that. Thank you. You guys are cute. Makes me sick. You guys are gross. Have you heard from Monica? Nope, not a thing. She hasn't even texted you\Nto make sure you're okay? Not once.\NI hate that girl. But there are tons\Nof other girls. You guys don't have\Nto worry about me. In support group,\Nthere's this new girl... and she has these humongous... How do you even know that? I'm blind, but\NI'm not that blind. Hazel Grace?\NHmm. Do you happen to\Nhave five dollars? Okay, so, now what? Hey, guys? I smell eggs. That eggs? Is it there? It's there.\NMmm-hmm. I'm nervous. Nervous? Is Monica in there? It doesn't matter\Nwhere Monica is. This is not about Monica.\NThis is about you. Okay. Can I have an egg?\NHazel Grace... egg me. Egged. Isaac. All right, here we go. - You got this.\N- All right. Come on. I didn't hear anything. It's all right. A little\Nmore to your left. Wait, throw to my left, or\Nshould I aim a little left? Aim left. Okay.\NLeft-er. Gus, I think we should\Nwait until dark. It's all dark to Isaac. Dude, I'm not deaf.\NI'm just blind. So I can hear when you\Nmake fun of my disability. I'm sorry.\NAnd I don't love it. Where do I throw?\NJust throw hard. Yes. Yes!\NYeah! What? What? I hit it! I hit it! Now I know exactly\Nwhere to line it up. That was so exhilarating! Keep it going-\NKeep going- Keep throwing, keep throwing. Give me more, give me\Nmore, give me more! Oh! Oh, Stop, stop, stop! Isaac.\NOh. Hello. Are you\NMonica's mother? I am.\NHello, ma'am. Your daughter, she's done\Na great injustice. So we've come here\Nseeking revenge. You see, we may not\Nlook like much... but between the three of us, we\Nhave five legs, four eyes... and two-and-a-half\Nworking pairs of lungs. But we also have\Ntwo dozen eggs... so if I were you,\NI would go back inside. Dude, it actually worked?\NYep. That was the stupidest speech\NI've ever... That actually worked? There you go.\NHold on. This feels so good! Augustus? Hazel Grace. Hi. Oh, my God.\NHi, hi. I love you. <i>I'm at the gas station.</i> You're what? <i>Something is wrong.</i> <i>You gotta...</i> <i>Can you come?\NCan you come and help me?</i> Gus! Gus. Babe, what's going on? Look. Gus, it's infected. Take a deep breath. Gus, I have to call somebody. No, no. Please don't call\N9-1-1. Please. Don't call my parents or 9... I will never forgive you\Nif you call them. Gus, what are you doing here? What are you doing here? I wanted to buy cigarettes. I don't know what\Nhappened to my pack. I might have lost\Nit or something, or they took it, but I just... I wanted to do something\Nfor myself, you know? I wanted to do it myself. I have to call 9-1-1.\NNo! I have to. No! Hi, 9-1-1?\NUm, we need an ambulance. I hate myself! My name is\NHazel Grace Lancaster. Please hurry. We're in a silver Jeep at\Nthe gas station. <i>I wish I could say\Nthat Augustus Waters</i> <i>kept his sense of\Nhumor until the end.</i> <i>That not for a single moment\Ndid his courage waver.</i> <i>But that is not what happened.</i> It hurts so much. I'm so stupid. Baby, it's okay. It's okay. Hazel? Will you tell me a story? A story? Or, like, a poem? I do know...\NI... I know a poem. Will you tell me it? The Red Wheelbarrow\Nby William Carlos Williams. "So much depends upon\Na red wheelbarrow "Glazed with rain water "beside the white chickens." That's it? Is that all? No, no, no, of course not.\NOf course not. "So much depends upon...\NA blue sky "Cut open by\Nthe branches of trees "And so much depends upon the...\NThe transparent G-tube "erupting from the belly of\Nthe blue-lipped boy "So much depends "on this observer\Nof the universe" How's he doing?

I'm just gonna hang out for\Na while, if you don't mind. Yeah, of course. Take your time. Here we go, bud. Good?\NAll right, sweetie. Okay- Hi. What are you thinking about? Oblivion. I know it's kid's stuff\Nor whatever, but... I always thought\NI would be a hero. I always thought I'd have\Na grand story to tell. You know, something they would\Npublish in all the papers, and... I mean, I was supposed\Nto be special. You are special, Augustus. Yeah, I know. But... you know what I mean. I do know what you mean,\NI just don't agree with you. You know this obsession you\Nhave with being remembered? Don't get mad.\NI am mad. I'm mad because I think you're special.\NAnd is that not enough? You think that the only way\Nto lead a meaningful life... is for everyone to remember\Nyou, for everyone to love you. Guess what, Gus.\NThis is your life, okay? This is all you get. You get me,\Nand you get your family, and you get this world,\Nand that's it. And if that's not\Nenough for you, then I'm sorry,\Nbut it's not nothing. Because I love you. And I'm gonna remember you. I'm sorry. You're right. I just wish you\Nwould be happy with that. Hey- It's a good life, Hazel Grace. It's not over yet, you know. Oh, Augustus. <i>One of the less bullshitty\Nconventions of the cancer genre...</i> <i>is the convention known as\Nthe "Last Good Day"...</i> <i>when it seems like the inexorable\Ndecline has suddenly plateaued...</i> <i>when the pain is,\Njust for a minute, bearable.</i> <i>The problem, of course, is that\Nthere's no way of knowing...</i> <i>that your last good day\Nis your last good day.</i> <i>At the time, it's just\Nanother decent day.</i> Hello, Augustus. <i>Good evening, Hazel Grace.</i> <i>A quick question for you.</i> <i>Did you ever write that eulogy\NI asked you to prepare?</i> I may have. <i>Do you think you could\Nfind your way down...</i> <i>to the literal Heart of Jesus\Nin the next few minutes?</i> Maybe. ls everything okay? <i>I love you, Hazel Grace.</i> Can I have the keys? Oh. Where you going? We're gonna eat something.\NI have to go. Hazel, you have to be hungry.\NYou didn't even eat lunch. I'm just not hungry. Hazel, you cannot not eat. I'm aggressively\Nun-hungry. Hazel, I know Gus is sick, but you\Ngot to take care of yourself. This has nothing to do with Gus. Well, then you've\Ngot to stay healthy. Come on, just eat\Nsomething, honey. "Stay healthy"? Okay, I'm not healthy,\Nand I'm gonna die. Do you realize that? I'm dying,\Nand you're gonna be here... and you're not gonna have anyone\Nto look after, or hover around... and you're not gonna be a mother\Nanymore, and I'm sorry... but there's nothing\NI can do about that. So, can I please go? Why would you say that to me? Because you said that. What are you talking about? In the ICU. Hazel... That's not the truth.\NI was wrong. All right? Even if you died... "When." Even when you die... I'll always be your mother. It's the greatest\Nthing I'll ever be. That is my biggest fear, Mom. When I am gone... you're not gonna\Nhave a life anymore. You're just gonna sit and\Nyou're gonna stare at walls... or you're gonna\Noff yourselves or... Hazel, honey,\Nwe're not gonna do that. Losing you... That is gonna hurt like hell. But you of all people know it's\Npossible to live with pain. You just do it. I'm taking classes\Nin social work. Wait, you're what? Yeah, um... You know, if I can take\Nwhat we've been through... and help other people,\Nmaybe counsel families... Mom, how could you\Nnot tell me this? We didn't want you\Nto feel abandoned. Feel abandoned? You guys, this is... This is the best news. You go. Okay? Baby. Straight ahead, yeah. To your left, a little bit. That's a step, right? Yeah, put your hand out. There's a podium to your right. Yeah, perfect. Beautiful. Hi. You're late. How you doing? You look\Nravishing, Hazel Grace. I know, right? What's going on, guys? Tell her, Gus. I wanted to attend\Nmy own funeral. I mean, I'm hopeful that I'll be\Nable to attend as a ghost, but... However, just in case\Nit doesn't work out... I decided to plan\Nthis pre-funeral. Ready? Augustus Waters was a cocky son of a bitch. But we forgave him. Not because of his\Nsuperhuman good looks... or because he only got 19 years when he should've\Ngotten way more. 18 years, buddy.

But when the scientists\Nfrom the future... come to my house\Nwith robot eyes... and they tell me\Nto try them on... I'm gonna tell those scientists\Nto piss off, because... because Gus, I don't even want\Nto see a world without you. I don't. I don't want to see a world\Nwithout Augustus Waters. Then, having made my point, I'll\Nprobably put the robot eyes on... because, you know,\Nthey're robot eyes. Sounds awesome. And I don't know...\NUm... This is just so hard. Um... Godspeed. Yeah. Hazel, can I get a hand here? To the right, a little bit. Yeah, and turn around.\NSit down. There you go. It's down to you, Hazel Grace. Hello.

Ours was an epic love story... and I probably won't be able to\Nget more than a sentence out... without disappearing\Ninto a puddle of tears. Like all real love stories... ours will die with us. As it should. You know, I'd kind of hoped that\Nhe would be the one eulogizing me. Because there's really\Nno one else... Yeah, no. Um... I'm not gonna talk about our\Nlove story, because I can't. So, instead,\NI'm gonna talk about math. I am not a mathematician,\Nbut I do know this. There are infinite numbers\Nbetween zero and one. There's point-one, point-one-two,\Nand point-one-one-two, and... and an infinite\Ncollection of others. Of course,\Nthere is a bigger infinite set of numbers\Nbetween zero and two... or between zero and a million. Some infinities are simply\Nbigger than other infinities. A writer that we used\Nto like taught us that. You know, I want more numbers... than I'm likely to get. And, God... do I want more days\Nfor Augustus Waters than what he got. But, Gus... my love... I cannot tell you\Nhow thankful I am... for our little infinity. Hold on. You gave me a forever... within the numbered days. And for that, lam... lam eternally grateful. I love you so much. I love you, too. <i>Augustus Waters died\Neight days later in the ICU.</i> <i>When the cancer,\Nwhich was made of him...</i> <i>stopped his heart, which\Nwas also made of him.</i> <i>It was unbearable.</i> <i>The whole thing.</i> <i>Every second,\Nworse than the last.</i> <i>One of the first things\Nthey ask you in the</i> ER... <i>is to rate your pain\Non a scale from one to ten.</i> <i>I've been asked this question\Nhundreds of times...</i> <i>and I remember once...</i> <i>when I couldn't catch my breath</i> <i>and it felt like\Nmy chest was on fire...</i> <i>the nurse asked me\Nto rate the pain.</i> <i>Though I couldn't speak,\NI held up nine fingers.</i> <i>Later, when I started\Nfeeling better...</i> <i>the nurse came in\Nand she called me a fighter.</i> <i>"You know how I know?"\Nshe said.</i> <i>"You called a ten a nine."</i> <i>But that wasn't the truth.</i> <i>I didn't call it a nine\Nbecause I was brave.</i> <i>The reason I called it a nine was\Nbecause I was saving my ten.</i> <i>And this was it.</i> <i>This was the great\Nand terrible ten.</i> <i>"I will fear no\Nevil, for You are with me...</i> "Your rod and your staff,\Nthey comfort me. "You prepare a table before me\Nin the presence of my enemies. "You anoint my head with oil.\NMy cup overflows. "Surely, goodness and love will\Nfollow me all the days of my life... "and I will dwell\Nin the house of the Lord... "forever." Augustus Waters\Nfought hard for many years. His battle was a courageous\None, and his strength... What a load of shit, huh, kid? ...was a source of inspiration\Nfor each and every one of us. Let us pray. We thank You, Lord, for the\Nlife of Augustus Waters... We need to\Nfake-pray now. ...for his\Nstrength and his courage. Lord, we ask that You be with\Nus today, that You be close... that You comfort\Nhis friends and family. Thank You for\NYour presence, Lord. All this we pray in Jesus' name. Amen. Amen. Now, we are going to hear\Nfrom Gus' special friend... Hazel Lancaster. Not that it really matters,\Nbut I was his girlfriend. There's a beautiful quote\Nin Gus' home that reads... "if you want the rainbow, you\Nhave to deal with the rain." Even in his last few days... Um... <i>I didn't believe a word.</i> He was always able\Nto crack a smile. <i>But that's okay.</i> <i>I knew this was\Nthe right thing to do.</i> <i>Funerals, I'd decided,\Nare not for the dead.</i> <i>They're for the living.</i> Hey, want some company? No, I'm okay. I'm just gonna drive\Nfor a bit by myself. Love you. Love you. You spoke beautifully. I'll see you soon.\NDrive safe. Okay- May I? <i>Omnis cellula e cellula.</i> Your boy Waters and I corresponded\Nquite a bit in his last days. Oh. So, you read\Nyour fan mail now? I wouldn't exactly\Ncall him a fan. He detested me. But he was quite insistent\NI attend his funeral... and tell you what became\Nof Anna and her mother... so here I am. And that's your answer,\N"Omnis cellula e cellula." "Life comes from life." I'm really not in the mood. You don't want an explanation? No, I don't. Thank you, though.\NHave a great life. You remind me of her. I remind a lot of people\Nof a lot of people. My daughter was eight. And she suffered\Nbeautifully for so long. She had leukemia like Anna? Just like Anna. I'm very sorry for your loss. And I'm sorry for yours. And\Nsorry for ruining your trip. You didn't ruin our trip. We had an amazing trip. Are you familiar\Nwith the Trolley Problem? There's a thought experiment\Nin the field of ethics... known as the Trolley Problem. Philippa Foot was\Nan English philosopher... Oh, my God. Hazel, I'm trying to\Nexplain something to you. I'm trying to give you\Nwhat you wanted. No, you're not! You are a drunk,\Nand you're a failure... and I need you to get out\Nof my car right now... so that I can go home, and\Nbe by myself and grieve! You'll want to read this. I don't want to read anything. Can you just get out of my car? Please get out of my car! Fine. Can I come in? I'm so, so sorry. Yeah. It was a privilege,\Nthough, wasn't it? To love him? Gives you an idea\Nhow we feel about you. Hazel? There's a friend\Nhere to see you. Do you know if\Nit hurt or whatever? Apparently he was struggling\Nfor breath for a long time... and then eventually\Nhe just went unconscious. It wasn't great or anything. Dying sucks. Gus really loved you, you know? I know. He wouldn't shut up about it. Yeah. It was annoying. He\Ntalked about you so much. I didn't find it that annoying. I know.\NI know you didn't. Did you get that letter\Nfrom your author friend? Ew. He's not my friend. How do you know about that? Well, I was talking\Nto him at the cemetery... and he said he came all this way\Nto give that letter to you. Yeah, well, I'm over it. I have no interest in reading another\Nword of that asshole's again. No, he didn't write it.\NGus wrote it. What? Apparently Gus wrote\Nsomething down and then sent it to Van Houten. Oh, my God. <i>Mr. Van Houten, I'm a good\Nperson, but a shitty writer.</i> <i>You're a shitty person,\Nbut a good writer.</i> <i>I think we'd make a good team.</i> <i>I don't want to ask you\Nfor any favors...</i> <i>but if you have the time, and from\Nwhat I saw, you have plenty...</i> <i>please fix this for me.</i> <i>It's a eulogy for Hazel.</i> <i>She asked me to write one,\Nand I'm trying.</i> <i>I just...\NI could use a little flair.</i> <i>See, the thing is, we all\Nwant to be remembered.</i> <i>But Hazel's different.</i> <i>Hazel knows the truth.</i> <i>She didn't want a million admirers.\NShe just wanted one.</i> <i>And she got it.</i> <i>Maybe she wasn't loved widely,\Nbut she was loved deeply.</i> <i>And isn't that more\Nthan most of us get?</i> <i>When Hazel was sick,\NI knew I was dying...</i> <i>but I didn't want to say so.</i> <i>She was in the ICU, and I\Nsnuck in for 10 minutes...</i> <i>and I sat with her,\Nbefore I got caught.</i> <i>Her eyes were closed.\NHer skin, pale.</i> <i>But her hands\Nwere still her hands.</i> <i>Still warm, and her nails were painted\Nthis dark blue-black color...</i> <i>and I just held them.</i> <i>And I willed myself to imagine\Na world without us...</i> <i>and what a worthless world\Nthat would be.</i> <i>She's so beautiful.</i> <i>You don't get tired\Nof looking at her.</i> <i>You never worry if she's\Nsmarter than you...</i> <i>because you know she is.</i> <i>She's funny without\Never being mean.</i> <i>I love her.</i> <i>God, I love her.</i> <i>I'm so lucky to love her,\NVan Houten.</i> <i>You don't get to choose if you\Nget hurt in this world...</i> <i>but you do have a say\Nin who hurts you.</i> <i>And I like my choices.</i> <i>I hope she likes hers.</i> <i>Okay, Hazel Grace?</i> Okay-
