Morning, Mr. Thrombey. Mr. Thrombey, you up there? Mr. Thrombey, I'm coming in. Shit! <i>You killed him! You bastard!\NYou murdered him!</i> <i>I didn't murder nobody.</i> <i>You slashed his face open and you left him\Nbleeding in the street, like a stuffed pig.</i> <i>Then you crushed his skull with a forklift\Nand burnt his hands off to erase the fingerprints.</i> <i>You'll never prove it.</i> <i>We have the nanny cam footage!</i> Alice, turn that off now, please. Why? It's almost over. Now, please. Just turn that off. They're finding out who did it,\Nand the WiFi sucks in my room... Turn it off now! Alice! Off! There isn't even anything bad on it,\Nit's just normal TV... They're talking murder on it! Your sister just had a friend\Nshe loves slit his throat open, and she doesn't need\Nto be hearing that right now! Let's be sensitive! Alice, you can keep watching\Nyour show, it's fine. No, I guessed who did it anyway. - I'm sorry Marta.\N- It's okay. It's Harlan's son. Hi, Walt. Hi, Martha. It's Walt. Would you mind\Ncoming to the house early? The police have\Na few more questions for everybody. What? Hey! Excuse me ma'am.\NYou with the help? Hey! Her name is Marta.\NShe was granddad's nurse. She's with us. "The help?" It's okay. I'm sorry. No. It's not okay.\NWhat the hell? How are you doing? Not very good. Alone. Lots of days,\Nand not knowing what to do next. Martha, anything you need. You're part of this family. Thank you. - How are you doing kiddo?\N- Linda. How are you? You know, the funeral helped, I guess.\NJust seeing him. I thought you should've been there.\NI was out voted. Get arrested.\NDie up your own ass for all I care! Richard. He's not coming. Ransom. Little shit.\NMissed the funeral. Excuse me. We're ready for you now.\NWe'd like to see you one at a time. All right. I'll go first. I'm assuming this will all be wrapped up\Nbefore the memorial tonight. We'll do our best, ma'am. So, how are you doing kiddo? We're just gonna reintroduce\Nourselves as a formality. I am Detective Lieutenant Elliott,\Nand this is Trooper Wagner. Now, I'm going to record,\Nthis just to make things easier. All right, we're with Linda Drysdale,\Nnee Thrombey, Harlan Thrombey's eldest daughter, in discussing the events\Nthat took place the night of his demise, one week ago, November 8th. We're very sorry for your loss. Thank you. That means a lot. So, we understand at that night\Nthe family had gathered to celebrate\Nyour father's 85th birthday. Yes. How was it? The party? Pre my dad's death? It was great. Did anyone besides the family\Nshow face? Fran, the housekeeper. He was a nice guy,\Nbut he was so hairy. And I dated Italian guys,\Nyou know what I mean. Marta, Harlan's caregiver,\Ngood girl, hard worker. Family's from Ecuador. And Wanetta - Greatnana,\NHarlan's mom. Hi Nana. His mom? How old is she? We have no idea. Okay, and your son Ransom,\Ndid he attend as well? Yes, but he left early. Ransom, are you leaving? Right, would you say that all three of you\Nshowed up around the same time? No. Richard came early\Nto help the caterers set up. Okay, and you and your husband Richard\Nwork at a real estate firm in Boston? No, it's my company. Right, right. Sorry. I built my business\Nfrom the ground up. Just like your father.\NYou two were very close? We had our own secret way\Nof communicating. You had to find that with dad. You had to find a game\Nto play with him. And if you did that,\Nand you played by his rules... Everyone idolizes their dad, right? I don't know, do they? Very much not,\Ndon't know why I said that. But my wife, Linda, does. Harlan started out\Nwith a rusty Smith-Corona, and built himself into one of the bestselling\Nmystery writers of all time. Wow, seems like all his kids\Nare self-made overachievers. Sure. For the record, I'm speaking with Walt Thrombey,\NHarlan Thrombey's youngest son. So, you run\Nyour father's publishing company? Yeah. It's my - it's our... It's the family's publishing company,\Ndad trusts me to run it. 30 languages, over 80 million\Ncopies sold. A real legacy. You guys fans? I mean, I don't do\Nmuch fiction reading myself. Big fan. I'm big fan.\NI mean... His plots are just like...\NI got one spoiler for you, But, okay, like "A Thousand Knives",\Nthe cow and the shotgun, like, where do you\Ncome up with that? Dad said the plots just popped into\Nhis head fully formed. It was the easy part for him. So, you're in the area, right? You guys probably arrived\Naround the same time? We all got here around 8. My wife Donna, she's my rock. Jesus! Donna. Are you all right? My son Jacob, he's 16.\NVery politically active. The boy is literally a Nazi. He's an alt-right troll dipshit. Kids today, with the internet.\NIt's amazing. So, the night went well? I mean, we're all gutted, but I was happy\Nto have that night with him. To be by his side, to think about our books\Nand what we've accomplished with them. It's like I can still feel\Nhis hand on my shoulder. Passing the torch. So, we're here with Joni Thrombey,\NHarlan Thrombey's daughter in law? Yeah, I married his son Neil.\NWe had one daughter, Meg. And then Neil passed on,\N15 years ago. And you remained close\Nto the Thrombeys. Oh, they're my family. I feel simultaneously freed by and supported by them. It's that balance of opposites\Nthat's the nugget of Flam. Sorry, the Nugget of...? Flam. Yeah, Flam, your skin care\Ncompany. Sorry. I forgive you. Yeah, it's skin care,\Nbut it promotes a total lifestyle. Self sufficiency with an acknowledgment\Nof human need. That's Flam, but it's also Harlan. He got me and Meg\Nthrough some tough times. Granddad gives my mom\Na yearly allowance, and he's never missed\Nwiring a tuition payment to my schools. He's a genuinely selfless man. But, you left his party early? Have fun. To see some friends at Smith. You know, Dad pays\Nfor her crypto-Marxist postdeconstructual feminist\Npoetry theory whatever major. She could've stuck around\Nfor the cake. I think Linda was upset. But Harlan understood. Right. You two showed up to the party\Naround the same time? If I could pause.\NBecause I just... Who is that guy?\NAnd why are we doing all this? Again? This is just follow up questions, We're tending to be thorough,\Nso we can figure out the manner of death. So by "manner of death"\Nyou mean if someone killed him? If one of us killed him.\NOne of his family. - No, Walt.\N- killed him. Is that what\Nyou're suggesting, Lieutenant? No one is saying that, okay?\NThis is all pro forma. Okay. So, who the fuck is that? This is Benoit Blanc. Benoit Blanc? Yes. Mr. Blanc is a private investigator\Nof great renown. Wait a minute. I read a tweet\Nabout a New Yorker article about you. The last of the gentlemen sleuths? You solved that case\Nwith the tennis champ. You're famous! Mr. Blanc is not with the police department,\Nand not officially involved in the case, but he's offered to consult. I happily obliged\Nand I can vouch for him. Mr. Blanc, I know who you are. I read your profile in the New Yorker.\NI found it delightful. I just buried my 85 year old father,\Nwho committed suicide. Why are you here? I'm here at the behest of a client. Who? I cannot say,\Nbut let me assure you this: my presence will be ornamental. You will find me a respectful,\Nquiet, passive observer of the truth. Fine. Are we getting there? Nearly. Harlan's nurse. She was at the party\Nin a professional capacity? Marta? I guess. Harlan hired her to be around to take care\Nof whatever medical needs popped up. But really she's\Nlike part of the family. Good kid.\NBeen a good friend to Harlan. Family's from Paraguay.\NLinda really likes her work ethic. "Immigrants - we get the job done." - From Hamilton.\N- Oh Hamilton! It's so good. I saw it at the public. May I just... Then, I'll recede, but... As a self-made man myself, I have to express my admiration\Nfor how you've followed in your father's footsteps. Thank you. Just marvelous, you know.\NThe whole family too. Joni with her thing,\NWalt with his publishing empire. Well. Yes, I mean, Walt, he's done well\Nwith what dad gave him. Not that it matters, but\Nreally, Dad hands him a book twice a year, and Walt publishes it. it's just not the same. But, surely, Walt runs the merchandising,\Nadaptations, film and television rights... Are you baiting me, Detective? You know he doesn't. And you think I am dumb enough to be baited into talking\Nfamily business, into shit talking my baby brother in front of a\Npolice detective and a state trooper... Walt doesn't run shit! Because there are no\NTV and film rights. Harlan's never allowed\Nany adaptations of his books. - Hated the idea.\N- No! Yeah! Drives Walt nuts. 'Cause that's where the real money is. Walt would get a little Irish courage in him,\Nhe'd get into it with Harlan. Did he get "into it" at the party? Oh my God! Come one, Dad! He wouldn't leave him alone, the poor guy.\NHarlan finally had to give him the hook. I didn't hear what he said,\Nbut he must've really handed him his lunch. 'Cause Walt was like a wounded puppy\Nthe rest of the night. What? Richard said what?\NNo, Jesus, we did not get "into it." I'm just trying to get\Nan accurate impression. Harlan took you aside at the party,\Nwhen you returned you were chastened. What did Harlan say to you? The Netflix guys, their business affairs guy,\Nhe sent something over, it's hard numbers this time,\Nand I just think this is a window, that's not gonna stay open,\Nwe need to take advantage of it, but then you just need\Nto look at the numbers. - Walt.\N- Dad! You put me in charge of our books,\Nlet me be in charge, let me do this! Please. They're not our books, son.\NThey're my books. And this is not how I wanted\Nto have this conversation. But you're right,\Nyou're right, it's... It's unfair of me to keep you tethered to something that isn't yours to control. What? I've done you a grave disservice. All these years I have kept you from building something of your own,\Nthat was yours. But you're not going to be running\Nthe publishing house anymore. You're free of it. Dad, are you firing me? We'll talk about details tomorrow. My mind's made up. Good boy. We talked, we had a business discussion\Nabout e-books. Jesus, it was nothing. You wanna talk about an argument,\Nhell, Ransom had an argument with him. Ransom, that's Richard and Linda's son? Look, we all love Ransom,\Nhe's a good kid, we love him. But? But he's always been\Nthe black sheep of the family. I'm not trying to... I like to keep\Nstuff like this in the family, but with Ransom,\Nhe's never had a job. And dad for some unknown reason\Nalways supported him. They have this love hate bond.\NThey fight. But that night, God,\Nthey had a blow out. About what? Are you, goddamn, insane? We couldn't make it out really,\Nbut it was huge. And it's strange they went\Ninto another room to do it. Usually, they like to stoke up drama\Nin front of the whole family. Speaking of getting into it. You were at the house early\Nto help the caterer set up. Did you converse\Nwith Harlan at that time? Well, he was there,\Nwe must have spoke. In his study? I don't think so. You see, I spoke with the caterer\Nthis morning. She didn't see you\Nhelping her staff, She did hear Harlan in a screaming match\Nwith someone that afternoon in his study. I don't... A screaming match? No. But Joni was here too, she was early. So, it might have been her,\Nmaybe ask her. These were two male voices. Harlan shouted the phrase. You tell her or I will! "You tell her or I will." Bells ringing? That's none of your business.\NYou stay out of my marriage! I know my daughter.\NAnd she would want to know. I've put it all of it in this letter to her.\NTomorrow she gets it. Harlan, I'm warning you.\NYou stay out of my marriage! She deserves to know\Nand you gonna tell her. - The hell I am.\N- You tell her or I will! Yes. I know. Yes. Harlan finally decided to put his mom\Nin a nursing home. Linda'd always opposed that. And I wanted to wait\Nuntil we got back from Boston to tell Linda. To avoid the whole scene. And Harlan wanted me\Nto tell her then. That was it. Sorry. Forgot. The house? Early. Richard said you were there. I was. At the house early. To see Harlan? To see Harlan. Yes. What were you seeing Harlan about? It was just a mix up\Nwith the payment for Meg's tuition. I'm sorry to press,\Nwhat kind of mix up? The school hasn't got the check yet,\NI don't know why Alan didn't mail it. Well, Alan didn't mail it\Nbecause he caught a discrepancy. Alan's office has been wiring tuition\Ndirectly to the school, as per your request. But Phyllis's office,\Nthat handles your yearly allowance, has been wiring the tuition money\Ndirectly to you as well. You have been double dipping Meg's tuition,\Nand stealing from me. 100 thousand dollars a year.\NFor the past four years. Harlan, I don't know how this mix up\Nhappened, but... So, now I am writing this tuition check, but you must know that this is\Nthe last money you or Meg will get from me. Please, you don't understand. Joni, I know it'll hurt,\Nbut it's all for the best. My mind's made up. It was a money wiring issue\Nwith the office at the school. So, I had to ask Harlan\Nto cut a check for this semester. No big deal. Why don't we just take\Na little break and we'll resume... She's gone. Richard. Joni. Have you seen Richard? No, I was just in with the... Okay, thanks. No. Goddammit! Richard! Richard. Son of a bitch! I might be a victim\Nof my own expectations here. But when the great Benoit Blanc\Ncomes knocking at my door I expect it's going to be about something,\Nif not extraordinary, then at least interesting. I'm sorry, this is an\Nopen and shut case of suicide and... Quite frankly, Benny, we're getting to the point\Nwhere I need to know what we're doing here. The method. Throat slit. Typical for a suicide? I mean, that's dramatic. But look around. I mean, the guy practically lives\Nin a clue board. You told me\Nto invite all of these people back for questioning all over again.\NI don't get it. This is a pleasant family with the usual quarrels,\Nbut no possible motives for murder. Where are you going? Harlan Thrombey's nurse, Marta... - Cabrera.\N- Marta Cabrera. Miss Cabrera, you can just wait inside\Nand we'll be... Miss Cabrera. I've been doing a little poking. You are hired on a part time basis\Nas a registered nurse, yes? Yes, I don't work for a VNA.\NHarlan hired me directly. Take a seat, please. And you're paid a flat rate\Nfor how many hours a week? Well, I started at 15, and then he... - He needed more help.\N- Medical help? He needed a friend. Does having a kind heart\Nmake you a good nurse? All right, Blanc, I mean.\NThis is... Marta, we were just discussing\Npossible motives in the family. I suspect that Harlan has told you\Nmuch unfiltered truth about each of them. And a little bird has told me, how should I put this delicately? You have a regurgitive reaction\Nto mistruthin'. Who told you that? Is it true? Yes. It's something I had\Nsince I was a kid. It's a physically thing that I... Just the thought of lying,\Nyeah, it makes me puke. Really? Is Richard having an affair? Why do men instinctively\Npull at loose threads on their parachutes? What? Richard? An affair? <i>A yes or no will do.</i> No. Oh shit! Dear girl I'm sorry. I assumed you\Nwere speaking figuratively. Here, here. Just take a sip of this. Take that. Quite something. But I was obviously right. Richard is having an affair, his father-in-law\Nfound out and confronted him. "You tell her or I will." Okay, but even if that was a case... - You all right?\N- Yeah. Even if that was a case, I mean, protecting a relationship as a motive,\Nthat's weak sauce, you know that. Well. And then there is Joni. Joni? Lifestyle guru Joni? No. Harlan was supporting her and her daughter,\Nand that's the opposite of a motive. And if that support was threatened?\NMiss Cabrera one moment please. Yes, I just wanna\Nget some Scope. Miss Cabrera. Was Harlan planning on\Ncutting off Joni's allowance? Oh, Joni. What's up? Oh my God. Don't answer that\Nif you're gonna puke again. Meg said he paid the school directly,\NJoni said he sends the money to her. Both were true. She was pocketing the double payment.\NHarlan found out and cut her off without a cent. Yes? So she bumps him off\Nfor the inheritance? Come on! No. Have you seen\Nher insta? She's an influencer. No. Allowance as a motive?\NAgain, more weak sauce. You're just dumping that bag\Nof weak sauce on it. Granted. But she lied to me. All three of them did. Three? Walter. I see where you are going with this. Harlan had turned Walter down before\Nregarding film rights. But that night something Harlan said\Nshook him. Now, we look at the pattern.\NHarlan was cleaning house. I wonder... Did he plan to fire Walter? Can I wait inside?\NI feel like I shouldn't be here. Yeah, please just wait inside,\Nstay close, all right? You have been very patient my friend. And yes. You are right. None of these weak alibis\Nand domestic squibbles answer your question: Why is Benoit Blanc here? Well, now I will tell you why. I'm here because this morning\Nsomeone dodged a very important question. Who? Me. Linda asked who hired me. Who hired you? I do not know. An envelope of cash showed up\Nat my apartment yesterday, with the news,\Nclipping of Thrombey's death. An envelope? That worked? An envelope of cash. So, somebody suspects foul play, and goes through this ha cha dance\Nof hiring me, of staying anonymous. It makes no damn sense. Compels me though. Walk me through everyone's\Nwhereabouts at the time of death. We know that the party\Nended around 11:30. Goodnight, Joni. Marta took Harlan upstairs\Nto give him his meds. The stairs leading up to Harlan's bedroom\Nand his attic office creak horribly. And Linda is a light sleeper. So we know every time someone\Ntook the stairs that night. The first was when Joni heard a ka-thunk\Nfrom somewhere above her in the house. She's concerned about Harlan,\Nso she goes up to investigate, waking Linda. Harlan was in his attic office with Marta. - Hi, Joni.\N- I just ... Hi. He explained that they\Nhad just knocked over the GO board. I just knocked over the GO board. That game with the grid and stones,\Nthey play it every night, and he was fine. - Go to bed.\N- Go to bed, Joni. - Love you.\N- Love you. So she did. Ten minutes later,\NLinda is awoken a second time by Marta leaving. Walt, I'm leaving! Walt was smoking a cigar\Non the porch with his son. He saw her leave and drive off. Noted the time - midnight. Fifteen minutes later, Linda is awoken\Nfor the third and final time by someone coming down the stairs. Harlan, who came down\Nfor a midnight snack. Dad, go to bed! Which Walt tried to discourage. Based on this, the medical examiner determined\Nthe time of death to be between 12:15 and 2 AM. As Walt was finishing his cigar,\Nabout 12:30, Meg came home. She went straight to bed.\NWalt and Jacob turned in shortly after that. Sometime later that night,\Nit's undetermined, but possibly near 3 AM, Meg woke up because the dogs\Nwere barking outside. She used the bathroom,\Nwent back to bed. That's it, all right? Everyone's stories matched,\Nevery moment accounted for. And there is no other staircase\Nup to Harlan's room? None. Just the creaky one. Interesting. So, we know that Ransom didn't do it\Nbecause he wasn't there. Marta couldn't have.\NHarlan was still alive when she left. Meg? Meg came home during the window\Nof the time of death. Except it was a suicide, all right?\NHarlan slit right through his carotid. We saw from the blood splat patterns\Nthat they were uninterrupted, meaning, It's almost impossible for anyone\Nto have been around him at the time. He's the one who cut his own throat, all right?\NI don't know why we keep going over this. Physical evidence can tell\Na clear story with a forked tongue. What? And as we can see from this morning.\NEveryone can lie. Well. Almost everyone. Miss Cabrera. We kept you waiting all afternoon\Nbecause I wanted to hear from you last. I needed an entire picture\Nof the evening in my head. Your piece of it\Nis at its very center. So please, take your time. You took Mr. Thrombey upstairs\Nat 11:30, and left at midnight. Think very carefully\Nand with as much detail as possible. Tell us what happened\Nin that half hour. - I got it.\N- You got it? I got it. Okay, that's... Hey. Harlan. Let's... There are no second thoughts! No, no. - Get up here!\N- I had dose of champagne. You only had one glass. We are not breaking tradition\Non my birthday! Can you just take your\Ngoddamn medicine and go to bed? If you're gonna put that vile shit in me\Nyou'll have to earn it. On my birthday. - 85th birthday.\N- Fine, Jesus. I'm so old. You really love drama, huh? Okay, let's do this, 9 by 9.\NYou ready? - I'll whip your ass.\N- Are you sure? How dare you? I know how this is gonna end. What is that? Why can't I beat you at this game? Because I'm not playing to beat you,\NI'm playing to built a beautiful pattern. That's elder abuse. I'm gonna call the AARP. Don't make me get the belt,\NI would, you know. It's basically over. My only hope is\Nthat an earthquake will strike. But what are the chances? Hello? Get under a door frame! Such a bad loser you are.\NMeds, then bed. I'm done with you. That's fair. Walt is smoking that filthy cigar\Nout there on the porch. Nasty things. How was tonight? Tonight was good. Oh, yeah? I know you weren't\Nlooking forward to it. No. But I did it.\NI cut the line on all four of them. It wasn't easy. This goddamn fortune. You know, sometimes I think that\Neverything I've given my family, I've done maybe, without knowing,\Nor maybe, to keep them beneath me. I certainly should have...\NI don't know... encouraged Walt to write\Nhis own stories, not just be a caretaker of mine. Like you said I should. And then be a father, not just a provider\Nfor Joni, like you've also said. I could've been kinder\Nto Linda and Ransom. Jesus, Ransom. There's so much of me in that kid. Confident, stupid, I dunno. Protected. Playing life like a game\Nwithout consequence, until you can't tell the difference between a stage prop\Nand a real knife. I don't fear death. But, oh God, I'd like to fix\Nsome of this before I go. Close the book with a flourish. I guess we'll see. I guess we will. Hey. You had a long day.\NYou wanna do drugs. - You mean the good stuff?\N- Yeah. Come on, send me to lala land. Just a tiny bit, okay? Why did I wait till my mid 80s\Nto become a morphine user. What a schmuck.\NWhat a nud-nig. This stuff is the best. Oh my god! Is there a problem? This is what I just gave you\Na 100 milligrams of. I messed up. You gave me a 100 milligrams\Nof the good stuff? Excuse me, but what is the good stuff's\Ndosage supposed to be? Let's not call it that right now, okay?\NThree milligrams. That's much less. So what happens? I'm gonna give you an emergency shot\Nof Naloxone, so that you don't die in ten minutes. Well, no pressure. You know, this is\Nan interesting and efficient method of murder.\NI need to write this down. So, if someone switched the meds\Non purpose, I'd be dead in ten minutes. Like stone cold dead? Yes, you'll feel symptoms in five.\NSweats, disorientation, and then... Yes, that big dose injected,\Nwithin ten your Your brain... Yes, ten minutes. Yeah, from the moment of injection. It's eightish now. And even if the victim called\Nfor an ambulance when he first felt symptoms, and if he lived in a great\Nbig country house like we do. The ambulance would take at least\N15 minutes to arrive, it'd be too late. If the victim didn't have\Nthe emergency Naxostuff. Marta. Do you have the Naxostuff? Yes, I'm gonna find it. I have it because it comes with the kit,\Nit should be here, it has to be, it's like a... It's not here, Harlan.\NI don't know, it's not here. So, I'm gonna use the phone, okay? To call an ambulance. What are you doing? What are you doing? Marta, listen to me. Harlan, I need to... Stop this! Stop this, Marta!\NThere is no time, you have to listen! I'm calling the family! What are you doing?\NAre you nuts? Harlan, we have to call the ambulance,\Nwe don't have time! Listen to me! If what you said is true,\NI'm gone, there's no saving me. We have six minutes. We have got to get you out of this.\NThink of your mom. My mom? Get behind, get behind.\NDon't make a noise. Harlan? Marta? Everything all right? - Hi, Joni.\N- Hi. I thought I heard something.\NIs everything okay? We're fine. I just knocked over\Nthe GO board, sorry about that. Everyone's all right? Yes, fine. Go to bed Joni. Okay. Maybe, we can talk tomorrow\Nabout the thing with.. Tomorrow is fine. - Love you.\N- Love you. Night. Come on. Pay attention now. Your mom is still undocumented, and if this is your fault she'll be found out and, at best, deported,\Nand your family will be broken. But we're not gonna let\Nthat happen, are we? But you have to do exactly\Nwhat I tell you. Will you do this Marta? This last thing.\NFor me. For your family. What do you want me to do? Go downstairs as noisily as you can,\Nand then say goodbye loudly. Walt! I'm leaving! Call attention to the time. God, it's midnight already. If you can. Drive out the gate, then to avoid\Nthe security cameras, pull off the road\Nbefore the carved elephant. Wait, was it before or after? <i>After the carved elephant.</i> No, he said before? Was it? <i>Beafterfore the carved elephant.</i> Oh, shit! Park and come back on foot\Nup to the house. Take the side yard path,\Nthrough that little gate. The dogs will know you,\Nthey shouldn't bark. You've got to get up to the third floor\Nwithout being seen. And the only way is to climb the side trellis\Nand come in through the trick hall window. - You gotta be kidding me.\N- I am not. Do it. And for God's sake\Ndon't make any noise. Once you're inside.\NNow, this is the tricky part. This is the tricky part? Get my robe and cap\Nfrom my bedroom, and put them on. Harlan, this is crazy.\NI don't think I can do... We need to make this so airtight that the average cop\Nwill entirely dismiss you as a suspect. It sounds crazy, but it will work. Walt is smoking outside,\Nand he'll see you through the glazed window. Dad, go back to bed. You were seen leaving,\Nthe security cameras show you driving off. And twenty minutes later\NI am seen alive and well by my son. You see, you've gone from suspect\Nnumber one to an impossibility. Leave the way you came,\Nand don't be seen. Ransom? Are you back again already? Drive home. And sometime, in the next few days\Nthe police will question you. No, no, no. I can't lie, you know\NI can't lie, I'll puke. Then don't lie. Tell fragments of the truth.\NIn this exact order: I took him upstairs,\Nwe played our nightly game of GO. At some point he knocked the board over\Nand Joni came up to check on us. I gave him pain medication,\Nhe pulled his shoulder last week. And I left him\Nin his study at midnight. I said goodbye to Walt. Went home. What kind of medication\Ndid you give him? Since his injury I've been giving him\Na 100 milligram IV push of Toradol. It's a non narcotic analgesic. And to help him sleep,\N3 milligrams of morphine. - And the family was aware of this?\N- Yes, of course. Did you notice anything strange,\Noff about his demeanor? No. Sounds about right. Thank you, Miss Cabrera. Hey, sis, people are gonna start\Ngetting here for the memorial pretty soon. Are you..? Are you all right? I was just thinking\Nabout Dad's games. This all feels like one,\Nlike something he'd write, not do. I keep waiting for the big reveal, where it all makes sense,\Nwouldn't that be nice? Walter. I don't think he killed himself.\NI don't. I really don't. There's this Hallmark movie called\N"Deadly By Surprise" with Danica McKellar. And she plays the wife,\Nwho's getting poisoned by her husband. But he's doing it little by little,\Nso she doesn't know it. And she goes crazy\Nand she kills herself. And my cousin, who's a receptionist\Nat the medical examiners office. She says that stuff totally happens. Say, with 3% as crazy as this stuff\Nshe's seen come through the... Oh, God. Yeah, I mean... You don't like him\Nbecause you love him. No, I don't like him,\Nhe's an asshole. But maybe, an asshole is what we needed. God, yeah... An asshole is what Germany\Nneeded in nineteen thirty... whatever. Those 2 things don't even complete. Jesus, I'm gonna disappear\Nuntil the politics talk is done. You want some champers? I can't. I'm technically working. Take off your red cap, Richard\Nand look around you. The streets\Nare literally flooded with Nazis. No, no, no. We're losing our way of life\Nand our culture. There are millions of Mexicans coming. And don't make this a race thing.\NYou always make this a race thing. I would say the same thing\Nif they were European immigrants. If the Swiss were like\Nclogging in the streets... We allow them in and\Nthey think they own... They're putting children in cages.\NI mean, these are camps! Come on, Joni.\NNobody's saying that isn't bad, but the parents\Nhave some blame here. For what? For wanting a better life\Nfor their kids? Isn't that what America is..? For breaking the law. And you gonna hate hearing this,\Nbut it's true. - America is for Americans.\N- Don't point at me! Where is Marta,\Nis she still here? Marta. Come on over.\NMarta, please. Come over. Marta, your family is from Uruguay,\Nbut you did it right. What I'm saying is, they did it legally.\NShe did it the right way. You work hard, and you'll earn\Nyour share from the ground up just like Dad\Nand like all the rest of us. And I bet\Nyou agree with me, right? Just leave the poor girl\Nalone, Richard. It's okay, I just wanna\Nhear what she has to say. It's okay, Marta, you can speak. Oh, sweetheart, don't feel\Npressured to answer. Look, if you wanna become an American,\Nthere are legal ways to do it. But if you break the law,\Nit doesn't matter how good you heart is, you gotta face the consequences. Are you, goddamn, insane? - Hey!\N- I warn you! So I ask her, I'm like, Tonya,\Nwhat is wrong with people literally? Oh my God, Marta. What? Marta! What's the matter? Whoa, hey. Breathe.\NMarta, are you okay? Hey, Fran, do you still have\Nyour stash? Take 'em whenever you need 'em. They're just drying out\Nsince you gave me that Juul. Thanks Fran. Hey. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.\NI'm very very sorry. Stop. Stop saying\Nyou're sorry, Jesus. God, my heart won't stop, I can't... It's just everything.\NNo, thank you. That's where Fran keeps her stash? Who's gonna open a clock? Do you want dinner, Nana?\NDinner? To eat? To eat? Walt, she's fine, she ate\Nthe entire salmon spread already. Walt, did you tell Marta yet,\Nwhat we all talked about? No, not yet.\NIs now a good time? Yes, yes a very good time.\NRight now. Okay, all right.\NCalm down. Calm down. Marta. We've been talking it over, and... Have you been smoking grass? No. Come on. Marta, we've been talking it over, the whole family,\Nwe'd like to take care of you. What does that mean? We all think\Nthat you deserve something. Financially, we'd like to help you out. You were never anything\Nbut good to dad. Because of that\Nyou can count on us. I thought you should've been\Nat the funeral, by the way. I was outvoted. Detective, you're still here? Did you know Harlan? He knew my father,\Nwho was a police detective, years ago. My father respected Harlan.\NThat says quite a lot. Is that why you're here? Here, now here? No. I stayed hoping to speak\Nto you a little more. Something is afoot\Nwith this whole affair. I know it, and I believe\Nyou know it too. So, you're gonna keep digging. Harlan's detectives, they dig,\Nthey rifle and root, truffle pigs. I anticipate the terminus\Nof gravity's rainbow. Gravity's Rainbow? - It's a novel.\N- Yeah, I know. - I haven't read it though.\N- Neither have I. Nobody has. But I like the title. It describes the path of a projectile,\Ndetermined by natural law. I Voilà, my method. I observe the facts,\Nwithout biases of the head or heart. I determine the arc's path,\Nstroll leisurely to its terminus, and the truth falls at my feet. The medical examiner\Nwas ready to rule this a suicide, but Elliott agreed\Nto keep it pending for 48 hours. Tomorrow morning I search the grounds\Nand the house, begin my investigation. I want you to be\Nby my side for it. What? My confidant, my eyes and ears. Wait, detective. Why me? I trust your kind heart. Also, you're the only one\Nwho had nothing to gain from Harlan's death. So, how about it, Watson? Detective, if you want my insight\Ninto this family. None of them are murderers.\NThat's my insight. And yet. Be it cruel or comforting, this machine unerringly\Narrives at the truth. That's what it does. Always? Tomorrow at 8. I know I missed something,\Nthere's gonna be something I missed. - But I know you can beat it\N- No, I can't... without losing your soul you have to do\Nwhat you have to do to beat this and win. Harlan, I can't. You can and you have to. For me. Right now! Harlan, I have to get you help. You do as I say - and everything will be just fine.\N- God, no. I promise. Please... Fifty years ago I worked at this estate. You know, security back then was such\Nthat you had to make the rounds with a 94 and keeping your ears open. Now, you got all this\Nmodern technology. That's the video there,\NI saved the tape from that night. Normally, I erase 'em\Nwith the magnetic de-gauser. But in this case I thought\NI just save it, you know? For security. That's the live feed there. <i>To avoid the security cameras,\Npull off the road after the carved elephant.</i> All right, well,\Ncan we see the actual tape? Of course, you can. I recorded it SSLP.\NThere's 8 hours on that tape, 9 PM to 5 AM. Looks like a Japanese horror movie. You think we can scan forward on that? How can we scan forward? Just hold the play button down\Nand press FF until you hear it grind. All right, should be coming up now\Nat the time when the party ended. What happened? You gotta keep holding it down\Nor else it'll eject. That thing eats tapes like popcorn. You think your guys can digitize it,\Nso we can scan it properly? Yeah, I think we can do that. I got it. You know, all these statues\Nthat you see around here, they are all straight out of his series\N"The Menagerie Tragedy" trilogy, pretty cool. - Awesome.\N- Yeah. Benny. It's beautiful out here. But do you really think someone\Nbroken into the house and murdered Harlan? Is that why we're out here? It is unlikely, but if they did,\Nthere will be traces. - I can take on that.\N- Yeah. Hey Wagner, you got any luck on... - What's his name?\N- Ransom? Yeah. No. Did get an address though.\N10 Kenoak street. Ten Kenoak. Kenoak. It's a pleasant thing to say, isn't it? Kenoak. I awoke\Namid Kenoak. That's funny. Always leaves and mud,\Nthey really gonna do a number on my boots. Mud, has it rained the past week? - No. Stay there!\N- What? Okay. We got footprints here. So, I wanna... - Marta, stop.\N- What? What? - Marta, stay there.\N- What? No, Marta, stay there, Marta! No! Did you call me? Excuse me. Wagner, we gonna need to call the boys,\Nso they come down here and take a look at\Nall these tracks, get it taped off. - Stay on that side.\N- I'm sorry. Hey. Best judge of character is a dog.\NI found that to be true. They've got plans\Nto read the will at around 10. The whole family will be here soon. I've never been to a will reading. You think it'll be like a game show. Think of a community theater\Nproduction of a tax return. So, what are we looking for? Oh, you know, anything suspicious\Nor out of the ordinary. You'll know it when you see it. Oh my God! Sweet beans! Well, good morning, Mrs. Thrombey. You think you could\Nhandle the study? Where's your medical bag? I don't know. I left it here.\NI always leave it here with Harlan at night. They must've taken it in\Nas evidence. I'll look into that. Shit. How'd the GO board get knocked over? We were just goofing around. What are you thinking? No, no, no.\NHey, hey, hey! Let me guess. Hey. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. Hugh Drysdale? Ransom. Call me Ransom.\NIt's my middle name. Only the help call me Hugh. Okay, this is Trooper Wagner,\NI'm Lieutenant Elliott. We just wanna ask\Na few questions. Excuse me. Sir? We're officers of the law. You gonna run me in? I don't feel\Nlike talking. I'm distraught. Hey Benny, you wanna ask\Nthis guy some questions? All right, what is this?\NWhat's this arrangement? Mr. Drysdale. CSI KFC? Hey Frannie, how about a glass\Nof cold milk? Hey asshole.\NNot her name, Not her job. Hey Meg. How's your\NSJW degree coming? - Trust fund prick.\N- All right. Guys. Hey, everyone. I'm just gonna be in the other room,\Nsetting up, be ready in 10 minutes. Funny, Ransom, you skipped the funeral,\Nbut you're early for the will reading. Okay, people grieve\Nin different ways, let's not... You know what?\NIt's funny you're here at all. Why are you even bothering?\NThat's what I'm asking myself. What's that supposed to mean? - He knows what it supposed to mean.\N- Wait. Walt. What? Jacob was in that bathroom\Nin the night of the party. Oh, that's where\Nyou were all night? The hell were you doing in the\Nbathroom all night? - Nothing.\N- Swatting Syrian refugees? - No. I was not.\N- Alt right troll. Liberal snowflake. I don't know\Nwhat any of that means. It means your son's\Na little creep. Oh, my son's a creep? Guys! Just... Walt, he was in the bathroom. Yeah, he was in the bathroom, joylessly masturbating\Nto pictures of dead deer. You know what, Richard?\NYou wanna go? You bet, Skippy. Let's go! You wanna go? C'mon! You better watch out! Stop! C'mon, you had me\Nwaiting for it my whole life! Stop it right now! I can handle myself!\NI can handle it. Oh my God! We gotta do this more often. Hey! Jacob, we know\Nwhere this is going. You were in the bathroom\Nnext to Harlan's office, where he had the fight\Nwith Ransom. Now, you heard something. Spill it. I just heard two things. ...my will! My will. And then there was more yelling, and then I heard\NRansom say "I'm warning you." Ransom? What's that mean? I think that means our father\Nfinally came to his senses and cut this worthless little brat\Nout of his will. So, I guess you gonna have to\Nsell the Beamer, and give your notice\Nat the country club, and kick whatever fashion drugs\Nyou're on. Because if you think that after\Nall the bridges you burned, After all the shit you said,\Nafter everything that you put this family through\Nfor the last 10 years, that any of us\Nare gonna support you, that any of us\Nare gonna give you, like dad liked to say,\Na single red dime, you're nuts! Son. Father? Did Harlan tell you he was\Ngonna cut you out of the will? Yup. Well, then he's done what\Nnone of us were strong enough to do. Maybe this might finally\Nmake you grow up. This might be the best thing\Nthat could ever happen to you. Thank you. My mother,\Nladies and gentlemen. Look, this is not gonna be easy\Nfor you, but it'll be good. Nothing good is ever easy. Up your ass, Joni. You've got your teeth in this family's\Ntit for a long time. Up your ass? Very nice. Matter of fact -\Neat shit, hows that? In fact, eat shit,\Neat shit, eat shit. - You entitled prick!\N- I would snap that smug smile... Definitely eat shit. Eat shit. I own it, shit! What was that about\Nwill readings being boring? Exception that proves the rule. Asshole. I'm warning you.\NRansom said "I'm warning you." You heard Ransom in there,\Nthat's the kind of thing he says. You want this? You want this? What do we have here? This looks like\Na relatively fresh break. Yup. Right there. Wait a minute. That doesn't make sense.\NWhere's that window? How about some more cookies, you?\NYou want some more cookies? Hey, maybe Harlem left you\Na cold glass of milk in his will, asshole! Show me, but stay off the carpet. It's the trick window!\NFrom "A Kill For All Seasons!" Trooper, here, will you take this? Traces of dried mud. I suspect they go\Nthe length of the hallway. Footprints? No, just traces. Depending on when this thing\Nwas last cleaned, this could've happened\Nat anytime, right? No, that would not explain this. Analyze that mud.\NIt will match these traces. And you will find similar samples,\Nleading up the trellis on the outside of the house. On the night of the party, somebody\Nwho did not want to be heard climbing those steps went to a great deal of trouble\Nto break into Harlan Thrombey's rooms. The game is afoot, eh Watson? Well. Thank you all for\Ngetting together like this, it isn't legally necessary,\Nbut I thought because you're all in town and some of you are leaving soon... Excuse me, I'm sorry. Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to\Ngently request that you all stay in town until the investigation is completed. He's gently requesting,\Nbut we gotta make that an order. No one move\Nuntil we figure this all out. - What?\N- Can we ask why? - Has something changed?\N- No. No it hasn't changed\Nor no we can't ask? Mr. Stevens, you may continue. Right. Well the other reason I thought\Nthis gathering would be beneficial is because Harlan altered\Nhis will a week before he died. He sealed, he asked me not to submit\Nit to the courts for probate until after his death. If anyone is confused about anything,\Nwe're all together, we can talk. Although, I don't imagine any of it\Nis going to be that complicated. Harlan's assets included - The house.\N- The house, which he owned outright. - Sixty million.\N- Yes. Sixty million in various\Ncash accounts and investments. And, of course, the real asset - sole ownership of Blood Like Wine,\Nhis publishing company. He also wrote up a statement when he was making\Nthe changes and he wanted that read first. "Dearest Linda, Walter, and Joni. Some of you may be surprised\Nby the choice I've made here. No pleasure was taken\Nin the exclusion, and its purpose was not to sow\Ngreater discord in the family, quite the opposite. Please accept it with grace\Nand without bitterness. But do accept it. It's for the best, Dad." Wow, well, yeah.\NNot too complex at all. This'll be quick. I, Harlan Thrombey, being of sound mind\Nand body, yada yada... I hereby direct that all my assets,\Nboth liquid and otherwise, I leave in their entirety\Nto Marta Cabrera. My entire ownership\Nof Blood Like Wine publishing I leave in its entirety to Marta Cabrera. The copyright of its catalog likewise\NI leave in its entirety to Marta Cabrera." What? No. That's not... No. That can't be.\NCan I see that please, Alan? - That's right.\N- Please. This can't be legal. It's right. - You know, he's been...\N- Oh my God! Alan, it's a mistake. I don't know what to say,\Nwe're his family, so... It's not possible! Are there safeguards against this? Harlan was... In his final days\Nhe was under weight of medication. Obviously, he wasn't...\NI mean... I don't know... Alan, you can take this piece of paper\Nand shove it right up your ass and get out. And you cops too.\NOut! Out! - Right now!\N- Melinda. No, Richard, we need to talk,\Nwe need to fight this thing. We're not going anywhere.\NI said get out! We're the Thrombeys goddammit!\NThis is still our house! Sorry. "Likewise the house at 2 Deerborn Drive and all belongings therein\NI leave to Marta Cabrera." You little bitch! You little bitch! Did you know about this?\NWere you in this from the beginning? No, no, no!\NI just wanna know! What were you doing?\NWere you boinking my father? "Boinking?" I think everybody just needs to cool... You had sex with my grandpa.\NYou dirty anchor baby. In the meantime I'd maybe run. Marta. - Ladies and gentlemen.\N- Talk to us. Marta, wait a minute. I totally understand\Nhow you must be feeling. You can talk to me. I don't know how this... I don't know. I don't know what's happening.\NI don't know why he... Guys, I'm also confused,\NI need to think. Marta! You listen... I can't catch up! I can't open the damn... Marta, you have to understand.\NHe is our father. Marta, don't listen to them. I'm here. I'm not on Twitter anymore. So, de-add me on Instagram, okay?\NI wanna talk to you. What's going on? I think this could be the best thing\Nto happen to all of you! What does he mean by that? Richard, why didn't you stop he? What was I supposed to do?\NGrab the bumper with my teeth? Okay, seriously though, what the hell? Hey, can we take an extra bowl? Sure. You look like you're gonna pass out.\NHave you eaten anything today? Eat. This is a nightmare. So why? - Why?\N- Why? Hey, this is everything. There gotta be a bigger reason why\Nand you know it. Well, how about it had to do more\Nwith you guys than with me. Yeah. Yeah, it's the only thing\Nthat makes sense. Did he tell you anything? Only that I wasn't getting a cent. That's because he wanted you to build\Nsomething from the ground... "Build something\Nfrom the ground up", yeah. My mother built her business\Nfrom the ground up with a million dollar loan\Nfrom my grandfather. My father owns none of it,\Nshe made him sign a prenup. He lives in fear. And I know that's what grandfather\Nwas trying to protect me from by doing this, And I know I shouldn't say this\Nout loud, but when he told me, I... Jesus, I coulda killed him. After I left the party, though,\NI was driving nowhere, just in the night,\Nand I had this... clarity. Like from here on out\NI was gonna have to fend for myself. And that felt... Good. The old bastard. Marta I know three things.\NOne: I know he didn't commit suicide. What makes you think that? I don't think it. I know it. Because I knew my granddad. Maybe you and I\Nare the only two who knew him, so you're not gonna bullshit\Nme on this, because two: I know lying makes you puke. 'Cause of that mafia game\Nlast 4th of July. And three: I know that you just ate a full plate\Nof baked beans and sausage. So. Look me in the eye and tell me what\Nhappened to my grandfather. - You asshole.\N- Marta. Tell me everything. Alan, there have got\Nto be options here. No. I don't know how many times I can repeat the same\Ntwo pieces of information. If Harlan was of sound mind\Nwhen he made the changes, and we've all confirmed he was. Would a sound mind\Ndo this! How? Sound how? The very action\Nspeaks to unsoundness! Not legally, no. You, not liking what he did\Ndoes not speak to testamentary capacity. What about undue influence? Yes! Undue influence!\NHow about that? Did you just Google that? Look, if Marta was manipulating\Ndad somehow, and if... If somehow she had gotten\Nher hooks into him. You need a strong case for that. Your honor, "She endeared herself to him through hard work and good humor." That won't cut the salami. What about the slayer rule? I did just Google that. The slayer rule obviously\Ndoesn't apply here. What the hell is the slayer rule? It's if someone is convicted of killing\Nthe person, they don't get their inheritance. Not even convicted, even if they're\Nheld responsible for their death in civil court. Like OJ. Yes, Like OJ.\NBut Harlan committed suicide. Detective Blank. You said that the investigation is ongoing,\Nyou made a point of that. Do you suspect foul play? Mister Blanc. If you please. There is much that remains unclear.\NBut yes. I suspect foul play. Marta? I have eliminated no suspects. You're full of shit, I don't trust\Nthis guy in the tweed suit, and Alan, God bless you,\Nyou're useless. Thank you. There's only one answer to this:\Nshe has to renounce the inheritance. She knows that's what\Nshe should do... That's exactly what she'll do. - Mom.\N- She'll do it. If Granddad wanted to give Marta\Neverything, then that's what he wanted. No, this wasn't him.\NHe loved us. He wanted us taken care of.\NHe wanted you to have an education. Meg, you think I can pay\Nfor your school? I know, just saying it it\Nsounds insane, but it's all true. And I think Blanc's been on to me\Nfrom the start. I don't care if I go to jail,\Nbut my mom... My sister, we... Are you gonna say something? I always thought I was the only one\Nthat could beat him at GO. I always thought\Nthat meant something. Yeah, I know you did. In the night of the party, my last\Nconversation with him, our last argument. that's what he told me about you. That you beat him in GO\Nmore than I do, and I thought... What a strange thing to tell me. I think I get it now. It did mean something. I'm not gonna tell my family shit. You're not going to jail.\NThat detective is not gonna catch you. And you're not gonna\Ngive up the money. This is was granddad wanted for you and me,\Nthink about what he did to go through with this. He wanted this for himself,\Nhe wanted this for the family. And he wanted it for you. You've come this far.\NLet me help you go all the way. What's going on? This isn't you. You could just turn me in right now\Nand still get your cut of the inheritance. Why? Because fuck my family. I can help you get away\Nwith this, and then... You're gonna give me\Nmy cut of the inheritance. Happy ending. Everybody wins:\Nyou, me, Harlan. Yeah. Deal? - Meg.\N- Marta. - That was nuts.\N- I know. Are you okay? Yeah. Are you? Yeah, I'm fine. Look, no one knows\NI'm calling you, I just... I wanted to... I wanted to say sorry\Nfor how everyone was. And... I guess I wanted to ask...\NWhat are you gonna do? What do you mean? Well, the... with the will.\NWhat are you gonna to do? What do you think I should do? You should do\Nwhatever you think is right. Look, I... I think you should\Ngive it back to us. Granddad always took\Ncare of us, we're his family. I know he was like family to you,\Nbut we're his actual family. Yeah. Marta, you know this isn't fair,\Nwe've always been good to you, and you're like family\Nand we'll take care of you, but... You have to make things right.\NYou know what's right. Marta. Mom's broke, she says\NI'm gonna have to drop out of school. No, no, Meg. Listen, I won't let that happen. Whatever money you need,\NI'll give it to you. I'm here for you. And I want you to know\NI'm gonna take care of you. - I promise that, okay?\N- Thanks. And once I... Okay then. Did Blanc find anything\Nsuspicious at the house? Yes, he found mud, upstairs,\Nwhere I broke in through the window. Identifiable prints? - No.\N- Good, okay. Good. Hey. You lay low for a coupe of days.\NWait for this investigation to blow over, and it will. 'Cause no matter how good that Blanc guy\Nthinks he is, he's got nothing. Hey, Relax. Marta get your ass up, what the hell is happening?\NThere's a guy here and a bunch of stuff. Everything's going crazy.\NAre we rich? Maybe, Alice, I don't know. I don't even know what that means\Nbut you better get your ass up. We don't know much about Marta Cabrera\Nor her exact relationship... Oh my God Marta.\NWhat is all this. What did you do? - Is that here?\N- Oh, yeah it is. Wait, so is that true?\NAre we rich? Oh my God. Good Morning, Mrs. Thrombey. Why is grief the providence of youth? I don't know. But I'd imagine that\Nage deepens all feelings. Including grief. This was a long walk to offering\Ncondolences for the loss of your son. And asking you if it isn't presumptuous\Nof me not to think too harshly of your family. if I am, as I suspect,\Nthe first to console you. They're young, aren't they? One thing I assume of age\Nis weariness. Damned if I don't get\Nmore tired every day. Tired of what I do.\NFollowing arcs, like lobbed rocks. The inevitability of truth. But the complexity\Nand the gray lie not in the truth but what you do\Nwith the truth once you have it. I think you have something\Nyou wanna tell me. I think you're very perceptive\Nand very capable of telling me what you saw\Nthe night of your son's party. But I'll happily wait.\NI'm in no rush. In fact, I find it quite pleasant,\Nsitting here with you. Lawyers were here,\Nvery big lawyers it looked like. They left all this stuff\Nand business cards, and there was a pile\Nof other stuff when I got home. I don't like any of this, Marta. I don't like it either. I'm slipping out the back.\NI'll be back later. Please don't talk to anyone. Walt? Yeah, I came from...\NHey, how are you doing? Walt, I want you to know\Nthat I didn't know about any of this. We know you didn't.\NWe know you didn't. Yeah, we all kinda went\Na little crazy yesterday. - Understandable.\N- Yeah. I haven't even looked\Nat all this yet. It must just be local lawyers and accountants\Nwho saw the news and wanna get a jump on it. I'd be careful of all of it. Marta, is it your intention\Nto renounce the inheritance? This is what Harlan wanted. Yeah, but, Harlan put you\Nin a very hard position here. It was unfair of him. You see the kind of\Npress and the scrutiny that this kicks up? We know... with your mother. - My mother?\N- Yeah. What did Meg tell you? This isn't about Meg. You're missing the point.\NWe don't wanna attack you with this. Marta, if your mother came into\Nthe country illegally, criminally, and you come into this inheritance\Nwith all the scrutiny that entails, I'd be afraid that could come to light.\NThat's what we wanna avoid here. We can protect you from\Nthat happening, or if it happens. So, you're saying that\Neven if it came to light. With your family's resources\Nyou could help me fix it. Yeah, with the right lawyers,\Nyou know, not these local guys, but New York lawyers,\NDC lawyers. With enough resources\Nput toward it, yes. Not that that ever even needs\Nto come up. But yes. Okay. Good. Okay? 'Cause Harlan gave\Nme all your resources. So, that means with my resources\NI'll be able to fix it. So, I guess I will find\Nthe right lawyers. Marta, that's... Better be sure if that's what you want. I don't know. What's this? It's my medical bag tag.\NThey have my medical bag, for some reason. Okay, but this is a photocopy of just the header\Nof a blood toxicology report on Harlan. Marta, this is gonna show\Nthe morphine overdose. So I'm screwed! How do you know all this stuff? I was Harlan's\Nresearch assistant for a summer. But what kind of blackmail\Nscheme is this? I mean the actual evidence\Nis sitting up the street at the crime lab. There are no demands,\Nthere's no meeting place. What's the point\Nof sending you this? Could be a half hour.\NCould be an hour. We wanna make sure... - What's the cheese?\N- Hey. - Thank you.\N- No problem. 5 AM, security systems\Nhere were all triggered. This thing went up really quick. So that means blood stores, records,\Nanything of that nature, it's all gone. There were no employees here,\Nso thank God for that. - What about security cameras?\N- Oh yeah. Speaking of security, the surveillance tape\Nat the Thrombey estate was all scrambled for some reason. What's still pending\Nfrom the autopsy? Just the report on the blood work. Blood work? Holy shit! This is insane! I mean who would blow up\Nthe whole real building just to blackmail me? Marta this means that the blackmailer\Nhas the only paper copy of the thing\Nthat can prove your guilt. You didn't get any other instructions,\Nno phone call, no email, nothing? I haven't checked my email. There is one. That's it. 1209 Columbus Road, 10 AM. You know what this means, right? If you destroy that copy\Nyou are totally in the clear. Oh no! Marta, did you hear me? Yeah. Elliott!\NWe gotta go! We gotta go! Okay, Baby Driver. Oh God! You regret helping me yet? I regret not taking the beamer. Oh shit! Vehicles in pursuit in\NWashington Street. - Make sure you say "No force."\N- No force. - We got a possible murder suspect.\N- I said that, I said that. Go! Go!\NAre you flooring it? I am literally flooring it. - This is going well.\N- I'm pulling over. If you miss your chance\Nto get this tox report it's all over. Oh my God! Why are we stopping? Why are you stopping\Nin the middle of the road? Hold on! Oh my God. I'm just pure adrenaline\Nright now, I feel like I swallowed bees. Okay, so, what is it?\NWhat's the address? - 1209 Columbus road.\N- Okay. I mean, whatever they want,\NI'll say yes because... You know, just to get\Nthat report back. - Get it back and destroy it.\N- Destroy it. Holy shit! Ransom. Thank you. I couldn't\Ndo this without you. Oh my God! Get out! That was the dumbest\Ncar chase of all time. Put your hands down. I spoke to Wanetta Thrombey,\NGreatnana. The night of the party she saw someone\Nclimbing the trellis to the third floor. Mr. Drysdale, come on. Pat him down, check him out. What's going on? "Ransom came back" she said. I don't know what he came back to do,\Nbut we'll find out. You have anything sharp? - Watch your head. Thank you.\N- You don't need to thank him. Did he ask you to drive\Nwhen he saw me coming? Yes. Blanc, you're coming with us? I'll drive with Marta. Let's go to the police station. I wanna full run down\Non everything he said to you. And I'll can catch you up\Non where we're at. Strange case from the start. A case with a hole in the middle. A donut? I'm just talking through my process here,\Nlet me know if this is boring. I feel the noose tightening,\Nthe family is truly desperate. Desperate motives. Then mystery of who hired me,\Nthe impossibility of the crime, and yet... A donut! One central piece,\Nand if it reveals itself the fog would lift, the arc would resolve,\Nthe slinky become unkinked. Do you mind\Nif I stop for a second? I need to pick something up.\NIt will be very quick. Sure. It'll be just a few minutes. I'll watch the door. Hello? Listen, I don't know what you want. Whatever it is we can work it out. But we have to figure it out\Nright here, right now. And I'm leaving with that report. Hello? Fran? No, no, no! Fran. Can you hear me?\NFran, give me a sign if you can hear me. You. Yes, it's me, it's Marta. You called me here, you sent\Nme an email, that's why I'm here. Did you take something? I'm gonna call an ambulance now\Nand you're going to be okay. You gonna be fine, okay?\NStay with me. What? Help me. - Stashed.\N- What? What are you saying? You did this! You won't get away with this! Jesus! Stop! <i>911, what's your emergency?</i> ♪ The thought of you stays bright ♪ ♪ Sometimes I stand\Nin the middle of the floor ♪ ♪ Not going left, not going... ♪ Oh lord. All right my friend,\Nthank you for the update. No need for that, I'll bring her in\Nonce we get word that the housekeeper is stable. It's still touch and go. All right. This is over.\NPeople are getting hurt. So, I'm gonna tell you\Nthe truth. Young Ransom just told\NLieutenant Elliott everything. Good. Wait, I hope\Nhe didn't cover for me. Did he tell the real truth\Nabout me switching the... Yeah. - And the disguise...\N- Yes. And the whole blackmailing... But why did Fran take my morphine? Obviously, she had swiped\Na bag from the house, but she didn't seem like a user to me,\Nunless that's why she needed the blackmail money... I don't know,\Nit doesn't matter anyway. I have to tell the Thrombeys myself,\NI feel like I owe that to them. I don't think that's a good idea. No, I have to do it!\NI need to do it! I gave the doctors my number,\Nso they'll call if anything changes with Fran. All right. We'll round up the Thrombeys\Nat the house, along with a police escort. For the arrest after. You can tell me your whole\Nstory on the drive over. I don't want any more surprises. Fran said it was stashed, the copy, and then she said,\N"you did this, you won't get away with it." I called the ambulance. That's it. All right. You ready? Okay, has she come\Nto her senses? She's standing right there Richard,\Nshe can speak for herself. Is the rest of the family here? - In the living room.\N- I think it would be better if we were to gather together\Nand get this over with. - Hey.\N- Hey. I'm sorry, I'm so sorry I told them\Nabout your mom. Meg, it's okay. I'm sorry. No, I was scared, I just,\NI didn't wanna tell them... I get it. Trust me. I understand. It's all right. I'm sorry. God, I'm so raiding Fran's\Nstash after this. I still think this is a bad idea,\Nbut the family is assembled. I know where the tox report is. She basically told me where it was. Anyway this will tie everything up. And I just handed it to you. God, you're not much\Nof a detective, are you? To be fair. You make a pretty lousy murderer. Perhaps we deserve each other. You've always been good to me. What I'm about to say isn't gonna be easy\Nand you're gonna be upset. But I thought after what\Nyou've gone through the last few days, that you deserved\Nto hear it from me. I... Excuse me! You have not been\Ngood to her. You have all treated her like shit\Nto steal back a fortune that you lost and she deserves. You're a pack of vultures\Nat the feast. Nose all beak's bloody. Well, you're not getting\Nbailed out, not this time. Ms. Cabrera has decided definitively\Nnot to renounce the inheritance. What? What? Furthermore, it will be my professional\Nrecommendation to the local authorities that the manner of death\Nin the case of Harlan Thrombey is ruled as suicide,\Nand the case is closed. - Blanc.\N- What? Thank you all for coming.\NGoodbye. What's going on? Just tell me what's... That's certainly not\Nwhat I was expecting. Is anybody else confused? Not what I was\Nexpecting to hear at all. Are you gonna tell me\Nwhat the hell is going on? Yes. I just wanna come clean, okay? - It's over.\N- Almost. Blanc, what are we doing? I'm sorry. Officer Wagner. Keep the family out of this room,\Nget them out of the house if you can. But stand by\Nwith your additional officer. - Get the family out?\N- Yes, but not all of them. Blanc. - Yes, sir.\N- Come on. Come on. What's with all this drama? Indulge me. Blanc. I told Ransom, Ransom told\Nyou, I'm telling you now - it is an immovable fact\Nthat I killed Harlan. Yes, you did. Yes, he did.\NYes, you are, but. But. I spoke in the car about the hole\Nat the center of this donut. And what you and Harlan did that fateful\Nnight seems at first glance to fill that hole perfectly. A donut hole in a donut's hole. But we must look a little closer. And when we do, we see that\Nthe donut hole has a hole in its center. It is not a donut hole, but a smaller\Ndonut with its own hole, and our donut is not holed at all! Blanc, look, I understand that\Nthis is amusing for you. Why was I hired?\NWhy would someone hire me? Someone fishing for a crime\Nto reverse the will, Blanc. I was hired before\Nthe sealed will was read. So yes, the person must have\Nknown the contents of the will. But one step further - that same person\Nmust have known a crime was committed, and further, if the intent was to reverse\NMarta's inheritance, they must've known\Nthat Marta was responsible. An intriguing combination of factors.\NSomeone who knew what Marta did, wanted to expose it,\Nbut could not reveal how they knew. Fran! She was blackmailing me,\Nshe knew what I did. But Fran wanted money,\Nergo she did not want the crime exposed. Did someone in the family observe Marta\Ndoing something suspicious? But they would've had no reason\Nnot to speak up. The answer is not so simple. Now with the entire solution\Nin my field of view. The arc of this case\Nis a tragedy of errors. And Marta, it will not be easy\Nfor you to hear. But there is at least one\Ntruly guilty party behind it all, guilty in the true sense\Nof acting with malice, committing a heinous crime\Nwith selfish intent. Trooper Wagner. Trooper Wagner? No. Marta, I'm so sorry. I told them everything,\NI figured it was up. I'm sorry. It's all right, Ransom,\NI'm glad you did. Not exactly everything though. Is this about what\NGreatnana told you? She saw me that night,\Nshe mistook me for Ransom. We'll get to that.\NIn the meanwhile, Mr. Hugh Ransom Drysdale, you might tell us all\Nwhy you hired me? Why I hired you? You're right, let's back up.\NTo the night of the party. Your argument with Harlan. What were the overheard words\Nby the Nazi child, masturbating in the bathroom? "my will" and\N"I'm warning you." You and Harlan were "drama mamas," you shared\Na love of twisting the knife into one another. You see, I don't believe he would've\Nslipped it in halfway - no, no, no. I submit Harlan told you everything. You can't be serious! Not a red dime or word of my work\Nto a single one of them, you included. Marta, remind me what Ransom said\Nhis conversation with Harlan ended with. Harlan told him that I could beat\Nhim at GO. And I asked myself - Marta? How would the topic of the will\Nhave steered around to Marta? There is one obvious explanation. You can't be that crazy, you're not\Njust gonna throw away your fortune. No. I'm giving it to Marta.\NAll of it. Your Brazilian nurse?\NAre you goddamn insane? I am sane for the first time\Nin my life and I've done it. I've made the change\Nto my will, it's done. I'm warning you! That's some heavy duty conjecture. Granted. But it is the only way of\Nwhat comes next makes sense. So, you storm out,\Nyou drive off into the night. You tell Marta later of, what was it?\NFeeling an overwhelming sense of... Clarity. That he has to make do\Nfor himself from here on out. Exactly! Marta. The will. Harlan.\NDo for yourself. "You won't get away with this." And a plan forms. You return, careful to avoid the\Ngate's security camera range. Then on foot up towards the house. You sneak in, up the trellis so as\Nnot to be seen by the rest of the family, who are still having their\Nparty downstairs. What you need to do\Nwill take moments. But it is essential that\Nyou are alone and undetected. You knew what medications Harlan took. You knew what Marta would be\Ninjecting him with that night. And you knew if Marta was responsible\Nfor his death, even unintentionally, the slayer rule would nullify the changed will,\Nand you would get your share back. You use the syringes in the kit to switch\Nthe liquids in the two medication vials. And, as a final precaution, you took the Naloxone,\Nthe life saving antidote. No, no. That's impossible. It is the truth. Hand me that vial of morphine,\NI'll show you. If he did that, if the meds were switched,\Nthen when I got them mixed up... I accidentally switched them back. I gave Harlan... The correct doses. Yes. But not accidentally. I taped over the labels\Nof these two vials. The vials themselves are identical. How'd you know\Nthat this was the morphine? I just knew. You knew because there is the slightest,\Nalmost imperceptible difference of tincture and viscosity\Nbetween the two liquids. You knew because you'd done it\Na hundred times. You gave him the correct medication\Nbecause you are a good nurse. Then Harlan was... I'm sorry Marta, but yes. Harlan was perfectly fine. His blood was normal. The cause of death was truly,\Nsolely suicide, and you are guilty of nothing but some damage to the trellis\Nand a few amateur theatrics. In fact, if Harlan had listened to you\Nand called the ambulance, he would be alive today. Hot damn. A twisted web. And we are not finished\Nuntangling it. Not yet. Marta, when Greatnana spotted you\Nclimbing down the trellis she said, Ransom? Are you back again already? <i>"Are you back again already?"\N'Cause earlier that night</i> Ransom, you're back! Come on, Marta. This is stoopid with two o's.\NYou don't have a shred of evidence, You're just spinning a fairy tale. Not a shred, no. Just as we have no real proof\Nof Marta's mixing up the vials. - so it's your word against.\N- You have her confession! All right, yeah.\NYeah, we do have that. With your permission,\NI'd like to spin a little further. Much later that night you'd have\Nto come back to the house to retrieve the incriminating\Ntampered vials. However, this time\Nthe dogs were outside. They barked waking Meg. No matter.\NYou'll get the vials tomorrow. But tomorrow brings news,\Nnot of a medical error and guilty nurse, but of a slit throat and suicide. Now the circumstances are perfect\Nfor the anonymous hiring of a me: you know a crime has been committed\Nby Ms. Cabrera, you need her to be caught for it,\Nyou cannot reveal how you know. Enter Benoit Blanc. Benny, look I hear\Nwhat you are saying, it's just... The body is discovered\Nearly the next morning. The police, the medical examiners,\Nthe family, everyone swarms in, and there is no possible way you can get\Nto Marta's medical bag to retrieve the vials. You must wait for your moment\Nwhen the investigation is over and you know\Nthe house will be empty. That is why you missed the funeral. There is no one home to wonder\Nwhy you're going into Harlan's study. Or so you think. Poor Fran. She witnessed you tampering\Nwith Harlan's medication in the medical bag. She did not know\Nwhat you were doing. But she knew you were up to no good,\Nso her mind begins to turn. Oh God, that Hallmark movie\Nshe told me about, with Danica McKellar. "Deadly By Surprise." That's what she\Nwas talking about. She loved Harlan. She hates Ransom. So the poor girl decides to test her theory\Nand make this asshole pay. She gets a copy of the toxicology report,\NI will be honest I have no idea how. 'Cause she has a cousin. She told me, she has a cousin who works\Nas a receptionist at the examiners office. Well, Voilà! The numbers, they mean\Nnothing to her, but if Ransom is guilty,\Nits existence is a threat, so she photocopies the header\Nand makes her blackmail note. So, why did she send it to me? She didn't. She sent it to Ransom. And when Mr. Drysdale gets it,\Nwhat is his reaction? Elation! He still thinks Marta has\Ngiven Harlan the tampered drugs! A blood tox report\Nwill prove her guilt. He goes to the will reading in high spirits,\Nready to see the family tear itself apart, secure in the knowledge it will all be undone\Nwhen the tox report comes to light. And then... Marta's confession. And everything turns on its head. Now he realizes that Marta\Nhas committed no crime, and the tox report\Nwill prove her innocence. The changed will is gonna stand.\NHe has lost. Unless... Unless you decide. You're not gonna\Ngive up the money. You're not gonna\Ngive up the money. - You've come this far!\N- You've come this far! Just one step further. Just one last act,\Nin for a penny, in for a pound. You decide. You are in. Step one: destroy all evidence\Nof Marta's innocence. Step two: send her the anonymous email\Nwith a late morning rendezvous time, and deliver her the blackmail note. Step three: keep your appointment\Nwith Fran. I knew it! I knew you were\Na no good son of a bitch! I knew Harlan wouldn't\Njust kill himself. Yes, Fran, you are right. I knew you were guilty as shit.\NAnd now you're gonna pay for it! Don't you come near me! Don't come near me,\NI'm warning you! Now the board is set.\NMarta will get the blackmail note. You'll put the pieces together for her. You'll guide her to the rendezvous. You'll make an anonymous call\Nto the police. They will catch her there\Nwith the body and the burned evidence. Marta will get arrested\Nfor killing Fran and Harlan. She said: You did this! <i>She didn't say "you did this,"\Nshe wasn't talking about me, she said,</i> Hugh did this. Hugh did this, 'cause you made\Nthe help call you Hugh. 'Cause you're an asshole. It would have worked. If we hadn't have brought you in for questioning,\Nso you could not make your anonymous call. And if Fran had not stashed\Na safety copy of the tox report. And if Marta had not outplayed you\Nonce again, by having a kind heart. By saving Fran's life, though it meant her losing the inheritance\Nand going to jail. She didn't play your game,\Nshe saved Fran's life. Fran's alive? Oh yes. Fran, who will confirm this\Nfairy story or something close to it. And send you, Hugh, to jail. Yes. Doctor, that's great news.\NWe'll be there soon. Thank you. She's okay. She's ready to talk. Trooper Wagner, if you could\Nkeep Mr. Drysdale in custody while Lieutenant Elliott,\NMs. Cabrera and myself we go to the hospital\Nand take Fran's statement. All right. Up. Come on. I'm gonna say this just to you. No cameras, no courtroom, just to you\Nbecause you know it's the truth. We allowed you into our home. We let you watch our granddad,\Nwe welcomed you into our family. And now you think\Nyou can steal it from us? You think I'm not gonna fight\Nto protect my home, our birthright, our ancestral family home? That is hooey! Harlan, he bought this place in the 80s\Nfrom a Pakistani real estate billionaire. Oh, shut up Blanc! Shut up! Shut up with that Kentucky fried\Nfog horn rag-horn drawl. Yeah, I killed Fran, but I guess I didn't.\NSo what do you have on me? Nothing. What?\NAttempted murder? I get arson for the building, and a few\Nother charges, with a good lawyer, which I have,\NI'll be out in no time. And then you'll see just how much hell\NI can wreak on your life, you vicious little bitch. What the shit!? - That means she's lying!\N- Yeah, man, we know. That's right, Fran's dead. And you just confessed to her murder. Well... In for a penny... Shit! ... He's cheating on you, I have proof I know\Nyou don't need to see. Untether yourself - Dad. Linda? We gotta get the attorneys\Non the phone. Right now! Can I ask? When did you know I had\Nsomething to do with Harlan's death? From the first moment you\Nset foot in front of me. Oh shit! I want you to remember\Nsomething that's very important: you won not by playing the game\NHarlan's way, but yours. You're a good person. This family. I should help them, right? I have my own opinion. But I have a feeling\Nyou'll follow your heart.
