BRIDGET: It all began\Non New Year's Day... in my thirty-second year\Nof being single. Once again,\NI found myself on my own... and going to my mother's\Nannual turkey curry buffet. Every year,\Nshe tries to fix me up... with some bushy-haired,\Nmiddle-aged bore... and I feared this year\Nwould be no exception. There you are, dumpling. BRIDGET: My mum-- a strange creature\Nfrom the time... when pickles on tooth picks... were still the height\Nof sophistication. Doilies, Pam?\NHello, Bridget. Third drawer from the top, Una. Under the mini gherkins. By the way, the Darcys are here.\NThey brought Mark with them. BRIDGET: Ah, here we go. You remember Mark. You used to play\Nin his paddling pool. He's a barrister.\NVery well off. No, I don't remember. He's divorced, apparently. His wife was Japanese.\NVery cruel race. Now, what are you\Ngoing to put on? This. MUM: Oh, don't be silly,\NBridget. You'll never get a boyfriend... if you look like you've\Nwandered out of Auschwitz. Now, run upstairs. I've laid out something\Nlovely on your bed. Tsk. [Sighs] ANDY WILLIAMS SINGING:\NYou're just too good to be true Can't take my eyes off of you BRIDGET: Great.\NI was wearing a carpet. UNCLE GEOFFREY: There she is. [Singing]\NMy little Bridget Hi, Uncle Geoffrey. Ha ha. -Hmm. Had a drink?\N-No. No? Come on, then. BRIDGET:\NActually, not my uncle. Someone who insists\NI call him uncle... while he gropes my ass... and asks me the question\Ndreaded by all Singletons. UNCLE GEOFFREY:\NSo...how's your love life? Super. Thanks, Uncle G. Still no fellow, then, eh?\NI don't know. You career girls.\NCan't put it off forever. UNA: Tick-tock, tick-tock. -Hello, Dad.\N-Hello, darling. How's it going? Torture. DAD: Your mother is trying to\Nfix you up with some divorcee. Uhh. Human-rights barrister.\NPretty nasty beast, apparently. BRIDGET: Hoo. Ding-dong. Maybe this time\NMum had got it right. Come on. Why don't we see\Nif Mark fancies a gherkin? [Whispering] Good luck. Mark? BRIDGET: Maybe this was\Nthe mysterious Mr. Right... I'd been waiting\Nmy whole life to meet. You remember Bridget. BRIDGET: Maybe not. She's used to\Nrun around your lawn... with no clothes on, remember? Uh, no, not as such. Come and look\Nat your gravy, Pam. I think it's going\Nto need sieving. Of course it doesn't\Nneed sieving. Just stir it, Una. Yes, of course.\NI'll be right there. Sorry. Lumpy gravy calls. ANDY WILLIAMS SINGING:\NLet me love you [Sighs] -So...ha.\N-So. You staying at your parents'\Nfor New Year? -Yes.\N-Mmm. -You?\N-Oh, no, no, no. I was in London\Nat a party last night... so I'm afraid\NI'm a bit hung over. Wish I could be lying\Nwith my head in the toilet... Like all normal people. [Chuckles, sighs] New Year's resolution--\Ndrink less. Oh, and quit smoking.\NMmm. Ha. -Oh.\N-Oh. Ha. And keep New Year's resolutions. Oh. And, uh... stop talking total nonsense\Nto strangers. In fact, stop talking,\Nfull stop. Yes, well,\Nperhaps it's time to eat. Mmm. ANDY WILLIAMS SINGING:\NI need you, baby MRS. DARCY: Apparently... she lives just 'round\Nthe corner from you. Mother, I do not need\Na blind date. Particularly not with some\Nverbally incontinent spinster... who smokes like a chimney,\Ndrinks like a fish... and dresses like her mother. Yummy. Turkey curry. My favorite. BRIDGET: And that was it.\NRight there. Right there.\NThat was the moment. I suddenly realized that unless\Nsome thing changed soon... I was going to live a life\Nwhere my major relationship... was with a bottle of wine... and I'd finally die\Nfat and alone... and be found three weeks later,\Nhalf-eaten by wild dogs. Or I was about to\Nturn into Glenn Close... in "Fatal Attraction." JAMIE O'NEAL SINGING:\NAll by myself Don't wanna be All by myself Anymore VOICE: You have no messages. [Guitar plays] JAMIE O'NEAL SINGING:\NWhen I was young I never needed anyone And making' love\Nwas just for fun Those days are gone All by myself Don't wanna be All by myself Anymore Ohh Ohh Oh-oh-oh All by myself Don't wanna live... BRIDGET: And so I made\Na major decision. I had to make sure\Nthat next year... I wouldn't end up shit-faced\Nand listening to sad FM... easy-listening\Nfor the over-thirties. I decided to take\Ncontrol of my life... and start a diary... to tell the truth\Nabout Bridget Jones... the whole truth. Resolution number one--\Nohh-- obviously will I lose\Ntwenty pounds. Number two... always put last night's panties\Nin the laundry basket. Equally important... will find nice sensible\Nboyfriend to go out with... and not continue to form\Nromantic attachments... to any of the following... alcoholics, workaholics,\Ncommitment-phobics... peepingtoms, megalomaniacs... emotional fuck wits,\Nor perverts. And especially\Nwill not fantasize... about a particular person\Nwho embodies all these things. ARETHA FRANKLIN SINGING:\NWhat you want Baby, I got What you need Do you know I got it? BRIDGET: Unfortunately, he\Njust happens to be my boss... Editor-in-Chief,\NDaniel Cleaver. And for various\Nslightly unfair reasons... relating to this year's\NChristmas party... I suspect he does not\Nfantasize about me. BRIDGET, DRUNK, SINGING:\NOh Can't live If living is without you I can't live Can't give anymore BRIDGET: Or maybe I'm wrong. Huh? [Indistinct chattering] BRIDGET: Ah. Happy New Year, Mr. Fitzherbert. Happy New Year, Brenda. BRIDGET: Mr. Fitzherbert--\NTits Pervert, more like. Daniel's boss who stares\Nfreely at my breasts... with no idea who lam\Nor what I do. Morning. I need that\N"Kafka's Motor bike" release... by 11:00. BRIDGET: Perpetua--\Nslightly senior... and therefore thinks\Nshe's in charge of me. Most of the time... I just want to staple things\Nto her head. [Telephone rings] Publicity. JUDE: All I asked--\NI only asked... if he wanted to come on\Na mini-break to Paris... BRIDGET: Daily call from Jude.\NBest friend. Head of investment\Nat Brightlings Bank... who spends most of her time... trapped in the lady's toilet,\Ncrying over fuck wit boyfriend. I'm too needy. JUDE: Am I codependent? No, you're not. It's not you.\NYou're lovely. It's Vile Richard. Ugh. He's just a big knob head\Nwith no knob. Is some people's\Nopinion of Kafka... but they couldn't\Nbe more wrong. This book is\Na searing vision... of the wounds our century\Nhas inflicted on-- on traditional masculinity. It's positively Vonnegut-esque. Thank you for calling,\NProfessor Leavis. Guest list for launch party. Ah. Was that...F.R. Leavis? Mm-hmm. DANIEL: Wow. Huh. The F.R. Leavis... who wrote "Mass Civilization\Nand Minority Culture"? Mm-hmm. The F.R. Leavis\Nwho died in 1978? Amazing. BRIDGET: Emergency summit\Nwith urban family... for coherent discussion\Nof career crisis. Fuck 'em.\NFuck the lot of them. Tell them they can stick\Nfucking Leavis... up their fucking asses. Good, good.\NThat's very useful, very useful. BRIDGET:\NShazzer--journalist... I likes to say "fuck" a lot. And, Jude, what would you do\Nif one of your assistants... made a harmless\Nlittle mistake like that? I'd fire you, Bridge. Excellent. Is that Cleaver chap\Nstill as cute as ever? Oh, God, yes. Then I think\Na well-timed blow job's... probably the best answer. -SHAZZER: Ohh.\N-Oh, you love it. Are you that chap\Nthat sang that song? Yes. Yes, I am. BRIDGET: Tom--\NEighties pop icon who only wrote\None hit record... then retired because\Nhe found that one record... was quite enough\Nto get him laid... for the whole of the Nineties. -Great song.\N-Thank you so much. BRIDGET: Total poof, of course. -More vodka?\N-No. Yes.\NFill her up, God damn it. BRIDGET: At least\Nnow I'm in my thirties... I can hold my drink. [Laughter] Ohh! Whoops. -Mind the step.\N-She's fine. Drive on. DANIEL: Apparently\NF.R. Leavis is coming. Afternoon, Bridget. PERPETUA: What do you mean\Nyou're going on holiday? Well, what about Julia? Does she have to go\Nto the funeral? [Gasps] Listen, we got\Na little problem... The only problem\Nis the kitchen. PERPETUA: Quite frankly,\Nthere isn't room... BRIDGET: Message Mr. Cleaver. Am appalled by message. Skirt is demonstrably\Nneither sick nor absent. Appalled by management's\Nblatantly size-ist attitude... to skirt. Suggest management sick,\Nnot skirt! PERPETUA:\NThat's quite ridiculous. Ooh. Oh, I see. DANIEL: Hang on. Hang on. Right. Yeah. No, I understand that. I understand that perfectly. BRIDGET:\NVery bad start to the year. Have been seduced\Nby informality... of messaging medium into\Nflirting with office scoundrel. Will persevere with resolution\Nto find a nice sensible man. Will put a stop to flirting...\Nfirst thing tomorrow. Good plan. PRETENDERS SINGING:\NDon't get me wrong DANIEL:\NIf walking past office... was attempt to demonstrate\Npresence of skirt... can only say that it\Nhas failed parlously. Cleave. BRIDGET: Shut up, please.\NI'm very busy and important. P.S. How dare you\Nsexually harass me... in this impertinent manner. DANIEL: Message Jones. Mortified to have\Ncaused offense. Will avoid all\Nnon-P.C. overtones in future. Deeply apologetic. P.S. Like your tits\Nin that top. I'm thinking\Nabout the fire works BRIDGET: Mustn't read\Ntoo much into it, no. [Humming Wedding March]\NDum lum dee dum Dum dum dee dum,\Ndum dum dee dum dum And it all began, of course... with some very\Nirresponsible e-mailing... over Bridget's\Nnon-existent skirt. PRETENDERS SINGING: If I split\Nlike light refracted I'm only off to wander Daniel.\NThe New York office for you. Yeah, tell them\NI'll get back to them. PRETENDERS SINGING:\NOnce in a while [Elevator bell dings] [Ding] Daniel. Jones-- -Evening, Kenneth.\N-Good evening, Daniel. [Ding] FITZHERBERT:\NIf you've got a moment... I'd like a word\Nbefore you leave tonight. Yes, certainly. [Ding] -I'll see you in a sec.\N-Excellent. -And, Brenda...\N-Yes? At the "Kafka's Motor bike"\Nthing... I thought it might be fun\Nif you introduce me... before I introduce him. Add a lovely sense of occasion. [Chuckles] Certainly, sir. Hmm. Tch. Brenda, listen. What are you doing tonight? Actually, I'm busy. All right. Well, that's a shame.\NI just, uh... well, I thought it might\Nbe a charitable thing... to take your skirt out\Nfor dinner... and try and fatten it up a bit. -Hmm.\N-Maybe you can come, too. What about tomorrow? No. Tomorrow's the launch. Ah, yes, of course. Possibly the worst book\Never published. Well, in the end, that's not\Nthe ad line we've gone for. Next night? Let's see, shall we? ["Peter Gunn" playing] Good night, Daniel. Right. No pressure, Bridge... but your whole future happiness\Nnow depends on how you behave... on this one social occasion. Right. What should I do? First, look gorgeous. [Tape rips]\NOhh! Ow! Gooh! Two--then totally ignore Daniel\Nand suck up to famous authors. Salman. Salman. Salman. Circulate. Oozing intelligence. Isn't it terrible\Nabout Chechnya? Isn't it terrible\Nabout Chechnya? Chech-nya! Introduce people\Nwith thoughtful details... such as, "Sheila... "This is Daniel.\NDaniel, this is Sheila. "Sheila enjoys horse-riding\Nand comes from New Zealand. "Daniel enjoys publishing\Nand comes--" All over your face? TOM: Exactly. Excuse me. I'm terribly sorry\Nto interrupt you... when you're having dinner.\NIt's just that-- Yes. Yes, it was me. Yes. Nine years ago. No current plans\Nto record anything else. Thank you so much. Oh, it's just that, ahem... your--your chair\Nis on my wife's coat. [Laughter] Your--your chair on the... Of course it is.\NOf course it is. MAN: Thank you so much.\NThank you. BRIDGET: Hmm. Major dilemma. If actually do,\Nby some terrible chance... end up inflagrante... surely these would be most\Nattractive at crucial moment. However, chances of\Nreaching crucial moment... greatly increase\Nby wearing these. Scary stomach-holding-in\Npanties. Very popular with grannies\Nthe world over. Ha. Tricky. Very tricky. ["Peter Gunn" continues playing] BRIDGET:\NLadies and gentlemen... welcome to the launch\Nof "Kafka's Motor bike"... "The Greatest Book\Nof Our Tiime"... and here to introduce it\Nis Mr. Tits Pervert. Ooh, Fitzherbert,\NFitzherbert, Fitzherbert. OK, circulate,\Noozing intelligence. Ignore Daniel, and be fabulous\Nwith everyone else. I am the intellectual equal\Nof everyone else here. Ooh. It's like a whole theory\Nof short fiction... and of the novella, you know? And, of course, the problem... with Martin's definition\Nof the novella... is that it really\Nonly applies to him. [Laughter] MAN: That doesn't\Nsound like Martin. Not.\N[Laughter] RUSHDIE: I could be wrong.\NWhat do you think? Uh...do you know... [Inhales] where the toilets are, huh? BRIDGET: Stay calm.\NCan't get any worse. What are you doing here? I've been asking myself\Nthe same question. I came with a colleague. So how are you? Well, apart from being\Nvery disappointed... not to see my favorite\Nreindeer jumper again... I'm well. Anyone going to introduce me? BRIDGET: Ah, introduce people\Nwith thoughtful details. Perpetua. Ha. This is Mark Darcy. Mark's a prematurely\Nmiddle-aged prick... with a cruel-raced ex-wife. Perpetua's  a fat-ass old bag... who spends her time\Nbossing me around. BRIDGET: Maybe not. Anyone going to introduce me? BRIDGET: Ah, Perpetua. Uh, this is Mark Darcy. Mark's a top barrister. Oh, he comes from\NGarth and Underwood. Perpetua is one\Nof my work colleagues. Why, Mark, I know you\Nby reputation, of course. Ah, Natasha. MARK: This is Bridget Jones.\NBridget, this is Natasha. Natasha is a top attorney\Nand specializes in family law. Bridget works in publishing... and used to play naked\Nin my paddling pool. -How odd.\N-Ha ha. Perpetua,\Nhow's the house hunt going? Disaster. I oughtn't go into it with you. By the by, that man is gorgeous. Ah, yes, Mark. Just give me time.\NGive me time. [Laughs] DANIEL: "You've written\Nas earing vision--" Can you remember\Nthe rest of this? RUSHDIE: "Of the wounds\Nour century... "has inflicted on\Ntraditional masculinity. "Positively Vonnegut-esgue."\NObviously. Listen, you don't know where\Nthe loos are here, do you? Uh, yes. In the hallway. Thanks. [Microphone not working] One, two. [Blows] [People chattering] Ladies and gentlemen. L-- BRIDGET: L-ladies and... L-- Oi! Oi! Sorry. The, uh... mike's not...\Nwork--working. Ahem. Ladies and gentlemen... welcome to the launch\Nof "Kafka's Motor bike"... "The Greatest Book of Our Time." [Mild applause] Obviously except for\Nyour books, Mr. Rushdie... which are also very good. And Lord Archer... yours aren't bad, either. [Clears throat]Anyway... uh, what I mean is, uh... welcome,\Nladies and gentlemen. Thank you for coming\Nto the launch of... one of the top thirty\Nbooks of our time. Anyway, at least. And here\Nto introduce it, ha... properly, ha ha... is, uh, the man\Nwe all call, uh... BRIDGET'S INNER VOICE:\N[Whispering] Tits Pervert. Mr... INNER VOICE:\NTits Pervert! Mr... INNER VOICE:\NTits Pervert. Fitzherbert, uh... because... that is his name. Mr. Fitzherbert. Thank you. [Mild applause] FITZHERBERT: Thank you, Brenda. [Sighs] Just switch this on. [Feedback] [Man laughs, people chattering] NATASHA: So how\Nautobiographical... is your work, Salman? RUSHDIE: You know,\Nit's an amazing thing... nobody's ever asked me\Nthat question. Excuse me. Jones. Sod 'em all. DANIEL: It was a brilliant... post-modernist masterpiece of\Noratorical fireworks, really. Uhh. You're looking very sexy, Jones. I think I'm gonna have to\Ntake you out to dinner now... whether you like it or not, OK? Come on, get your stuff. [Sighs] So how do you feel about\Nthis whole situation... in Chechnya?\NIsn't it a nightmare? I couldn't give  a fuck, Jones. Now, look, how do you\Nknow Arsey Darcy? Apparently, I used\Nto run 'round naked... in his paddling pool. I bet you did, you dirty bitch. What about you? Same. Yeah. No, no, I was best man\Nat his wedding. Um, knew him from Cambridge. He was a mate. And then what? And then, uh...nothing. You don't need to protect him.\NHe's no friend of mine. Well, um, then... many years later... I made the somewhat\Ncatastrophic mistake... of introducing him\Nto my fiancee. And, um... I couldn't say, in all honesty,\NI've ever quite forgiven him. God, so... he's a nasty bastard. And a dull bastard. Yes. Yes,\NI think that's fair. Anyway, fuck him. Listen,\Ndon't let him ruin our evening. Why don't you have\Nsome more wine... and tell me more about\Npracticing French-kissing... with the other girls\Nat school... because that's\Na very good story. -It wasn't French-kissing.\N-Don't care. Make it up. That's an order, Jones. DANIEL: So, um, how about\Na drink at my place? Totally innocent,\Nno funny business... just full sex. No, no, no. I should get a taxi. But thank you\Nfor the lovely dinner. It's a pleasure, Jones. ROSEY SINGING: Oh, love Love, love Oh Ooh You're alone All the time Does it ever puzzle you Have you asked why you seem To falling love And out again Do you really ever love Or just pretend Oh, baby Why fool yourself? Don't be afraid\Nto help yourself DANIEL: Now these are very\Nsilly little boots, Jones. And this is a very\Nsilly little dress. And, um... these are, uh... fuck me,\Nabsolutely enormous panties. Jesus. Fuck. No, no, don't apologize.\NI like them. Hello, Mummy. ROSEY SINGING: Love I'm sorry, I have to have\Nanother look. -They're too good to be true.\N-No. There's nothing to be\Nembarrassed about. I'm wearing something\Nquite similar myself. -Here, I'll show you.\N-No. No. ROSEY SINGING:\NThis time decide That you will open up Let it in There's no shame\Nin sharin' love You feel within So jump right in Head over heels And fall right in Ha. Huh. That was fantastic. Ohh. Mmm. Ay, ay. BRIDGET: Ohh. Daniel. Yeah? What happens at the office? Oh. Well,\NI'm glad you asked that. You see,\Nit's a publishing house. So that means that people\Nwrite things for us... and then we print out\Nall the pages... and fasten them together... and make them into what\Nwe call a book, Jones. No, do you think\Npeople will notice? Notice what? Us. Working together,\Nsleeping together. Hang on a minute, Jones. Just slow down.\NIt started on Tuesday... and now it's Thursday. It's not exactly... um, a long-term relationship,\Nis it? You're very bad. [Telephone rings] [Ring ring] Ohh. [Ring ring] Mmm. Bridget Jones,\Nwant on sex goddess... with a very bad man\Nbetween her thighs. Mum. Hi. BRIDGET: It's the truth\Nuniversally acknowledged... that the moment one area\Nof your life starts going OK... another part of it falls\Nspectacularly to pieces. PAMELA: Ah, anyone else want\Nto have it off? Ha ha. Don't be shy, madame. French. Have it oeuf. Ha ha!\NWith the wise crack egg peeler. Now, nice firm grip. Put it in the hole. And... up, down, up, down. And off it comes in your hand. Oh! Mind the over-spray.\NSorry. Darling, if I came in\Nwith my knickers on my head... he wouldn't notice. I spent thirty-five years\Ncleaning his house... washing his clothes,\Nbringing up his children. I'm your child, too. To be honest, darling,\Nhaving children... isn't all it's cracked up to be. Given my chance again,\NI'm not sure I'd have any. MUM: And now it's\Nthe winter of my life... and I haven't actually\Ngot anything of my own. I've got no power,\Nno real career... no--no sex life. I've got no life at all. I'm like the grasshopper\Nwho sang all summer. I'm like Germaine sodding Geer. Greer. Well, anyway, I'm not having it.\NAnd I've been talent spotted. Julian thinks\NI've got great potential. Who's Julian? From the Home Shopping Channel. Comes into the store\Nto have his colors done. Potential for what? As a demonstrator\Non his cable show. You know, his assistant. Apparently, it's the highest-\Nrated show on the channel. Well, apart from the one... where the fat people\Nbeat up their relatives. Ooh! I must wiz. -Have you heard from Mark Darcy?\N-Goodbye, Mum. THE DRAMATICS SINGING:\NMrs. Mrs. Jones MUM: Julian. Sorry to keep you waiting. THE DRAMATICS SINGING:\NGoin' on and on and on and on BRIDGET: And a few weeks later,\Nit got lots worse. Hello! Look at this. JULIAN: Paying off\Nthis heart-shaped pendant. One of my own personal\Nrecommendations... is this absolutely stunning... matching necklace\Nand earring set. JULIAN: The earrings measuring\Njust over a centimeter... in genuine diamond with\Ntwo pairs in lapis lazuli... in a lovely mock-gold finish. JULIAN: The exact replica\Nof those worn at Wimbledon... in 1993 by Her Royal Highness\Nthe Duchess of Kent. [Turns off sound] Well. Has she actually moved out then? Apparently, she and this\Ntangerine-tinted buffoon... are suddenly an item. Half our friends have had them\Naround to bloody dinner. DAD: She's even\Ntaking Jaundice Julian... to Una Alconbury's\NTarts and Vicars party. That's not the Pamela I knew.\NThat's cruel. BRIDGET: Well, still,\Ncould be a golden opportunity. If you spent the entire party\Nflirting with other women... it would drive Mum\Nwild with jealousy. DAD: What? BRIDGET:\NThat's how I got my man. Have you got a boyfriend?\NA real one? I have, Father. I have. And he's perfect. [Car horn honking] [Revs engine] BRIDGET: Hurrah.\NAm no longer tragic spinster... but proper girlfriend\Nof bonafide a sex god... so committed\Nthat he's taking me... on a full-blown mini-break\Nholiday weekend. DANIEL: Just promise me\Nwe don't have to sit... in any little boats and read\Nponcey poetry to each other. BRIDGET: He's also protecting\Nme at Uncle Geoffrey's... hideous Tarts and Vicars\Nfancy dress party. This can't be just shagging. A mini-break means true love. Suddenly feel like\Nscreen goddess... in manner of Grace Kelly. Though perhaps ever so slightly\Nless elegant under pressure. It's very quiet here, isn't it?\NAre we the only guests, or... We have a wedding this weekend. I believe there are just\Nfour of you not involved. Oh. Hmm. NATASHA: You do the boats,\NI'll do the tea. Oh, Jesus. -Hello there.\N-Hi. MARK: Well, well. I take it you're also heading\Nfor the Alconbury's rockery. Yes, that's right. I brought Natasha.\NGet a bit of work done. Thought I might make it\Na not entirely wasted weekend. How interesting. What a gripping life\Nyou do lead. DANIEL: I'll see you\Nupstairs in a second. Hmm. Well, the weakness\Nof their case... Lies in the deposition\Nthey made on August 30. BRIDGET: Season of mist... and... mellow fruitlessness. Oh, fuck me, I love Keats. Have you heard this one? "There was a young woman\Nfrom Ealing... "who had a peculiar feeling. "She lay on her back\Nand opened her crack... "and pissed\Nall over the ceiling." [Bang]\NOh, bollocks. BRIDGET: What've you done? -I'm boarding you, Bridge.\N-Don't you dare! -I'm king of the world!\N-No! Fuck me. Uhh! BRIDGET: Aah! [Bridget laughs] DANIEL: Oh, piss and bollocks. You stupid ass. [Laughing] Bollocks. All right. Aah! No! So childish. BRIDGET: Aah! No! Yes. DANIEL:\NHey, Darce, come on in! The water's lovely! Come on, you're working\Ntoo hard, mate. Ha ha! -Daniel.\N-Yes, Bridget? That thing you just did\Nis actually illegal... in several countries. Well, that is, of course,\Nthe major reason... I'm so thrilled to be\Nliving in Britain today. Yes. I can't understand... why the Prime Minister\Ndoesn't mention it more... in his speeches. You should write\Nto him about it. BRIDGET: I intend to. Daniel. DANIEL: Bridget. -Do you love me?\N-Shut up, or I'll do it again. Do you love me? Right. You asked for it. DANIEL: And over we go. I'm going to give you\Nsomething to bite on. Here. OK? Pop this in your mouth,\Ndarling. [Bridget laughs] You're begging for it. [Bridget laughs] BRIDGET: Stop it. [Laughs] No, no. Hmm. I got to go back to town.\NA meeting's come up. On a Sunday? DANIEL: No. The meeting's\Nfirst thing tomorrow. I've got to work\Non some figures. We could just pop\Ninto the party for a minute. DANIEL: Bridget,\NI'm really sorry. I just can't do it.\NI've got to head back. Listen, Daniel... if you've changed your mind,\Nyou could just say so... because, honestly, I don't see\Nwhat could be so important. No, well, you wouldn't,\Nwould you? Because you don't have\Nthe faintest bloody idea... of just how much trouble\Nthe company's in. You swan in\Nin your short skirt... and your sexy\Nsee-through blouse... and fanny around\Nwith press releases. You know, this is\Nthe Americans flying in... because they're thinking\Nof shutting us down... for fuck's sake. Sorry. I'm sorry, Bridge.\NI know I'm being a prat. Look, I'm going\Nto arrange a lovely car... to come and pick you up\Nand take you back... to London after the party, OK? If you have to travel alone,\Ntravel in style. Hmm. And, um... I also think\Nit's very important... that you win\Nthis costume competition. Good. Good start. Now, then, Miss Jones,\Nwhere does this go? BRIDGET:\NOh, well, here we go. Trying hard\Nto fight off a vision... of Mum and Auntie Una\Nin fishnet tights. Seems unnatural, wrong even,\Nfor 60-year-olds to dress up... as prostitutes and priests\Non a Sunday afternoon. [People chattering] [Laughter] JULIE LONDON SINGING:\NFly me to the moon BRIDGET: Oh, holy Jesus. Bridget. Where are all the other\NTarts and Vicars? UNA: Oh, dear.\NDidn't Geoffrey call you? Didn't you telephone\NColin and Bridget? How's my little Bridget? GEOFFREY: Bop, bop. Oh. Geoffrey. So, where's this chap\Nof yours, then, eh? Ah, yes, well,\Nhe had to work, so... Ha! A likely tale. Off they run. Whee! [Laughs weakly] JULIE LONDON SINGING:\NYou are all I long for Bizarre what some men\Nfind attractive. Oh, God. MUM: Darling!\NGeoffrey! What on earth are you wearing? You look like\Na common prostitute. Yes, well, that was,\Nactually, the point. Say hi to Julian. Hello, Julian. My dear... you and your mother\Ncould be sisters. JULIAN:\NAnd what a lovely bracelet. It's what I call\Nan all-arounder-- the sort of thing one can wear\Nwith anything to any occasion. Oh. Have you spoken to my dad? Yes. He's behaving\Nmost bizarrely. I think he was actually\Ntrying to flirt... with Penny Husbands-Bosworth,\Npoor thing. She was very frightened. She's only just had\Nher ovaries done. I don't know what\Nyou ever saw in him. Shh. Bad man.\N[Both laugh] [Breathes deeply] [Footsteps] Heh heh. Didn't tell you, either. [Laughs] No. I didn't spend as much\Nas Bernard, thank God. BRIDGET: Oh. I'm sorry, Dad. The way she looked at me. Well, she loves you, really. You love each other. This is only a temporary glitch. Is it? I don't know. DAD: I don't know. UNA: Ah, Bridget, there you are. Don't worry.\NYou're not the only one. This is Penny. Geoffrey didn't\Nget in touch with her, either. I'm sorry? I was just saying Geoffrey\Ndidn't contact you, either... to tell you that\Nthe Tarts and Vicars concept... had gone out of the window. Oh, yes, he did. Oh, right. Lovely dress. Very exotic. What a shame you couldn't\Nbring your boyfriend, Bridget. What's his name?\NDavid? Darren? MARK: Daniel Cleaver. Oh. Is he a friend\Nof yours, Mark? Absolutely not. I hope he's good enough\Nfor our little Bridget. I think I can say with\Ntotal confidence absolutely not. Well, I'm sure he'd say\Nthe same about you... given your past behavior. Sorry? I think you know what I mean. Mark. BRIDGET: Hmm.\NLooks like Auntie Shirley... didn't get the message, either. [Doorbell rings] Hi. I really, really wanted\Nto see a friendly face. Oh, now, listen,\NI'll tell you what. I have an idea.\NLet me finish this... while you go home,\Nhave a long hot bath... and I'll call round,\Nand we'll have dinner later, OK? [Door closes] Is there someone here? Not that I'm aware of. Unless that Bosnian family\Nhas moved in again. Bastards. [Laughs] Oh. I'm sorry. Sorry. I'm going mad. Listen, I am feeling\Nreally bad, actually. -I should've been there today.\N-No, I'm sorry. No, no, I'm sorry... but at least I got\Na hell of a lot of work done. Just give me one more hour, OK? Fine. That's fine. I will go home and de-bunny. Oh... and you know last night\Nwhen I said that I loved you? Mm-hmm. I didn't mean it. I was being ironic. Oh, God, yeah,\NI know, I know. All right. -Thank you, madam.\N-Mmm. [Drops bag] Bridge. Bridget. This is Lara from\Nthe New York office. Lara, this is Bridget. Hey, there. LARA:\NI thought you said she was thin. ALEX: I was hoping that you\Nwould want to be a part of it. [Bridget sniffles] DAN: This is totally insane. I'm 36 years old. It may be\Nmy last chance to have a child. Alex. Aah! NARRATOR: The male penetrates\Nthe female and leaves. Coitus is brief\Nand perfunctory... and the female... [Continues indistinctly] That's wonderful. DANIEL:\NWell, I don't think it's bad. DANIEL: Right. BRIDGET: We've had\Nvery good response... to the Teddy Knows Best\Nteaser campaign and had various\Nlocal radio bits for-- Look, Bridge, stop that. DANIEL: I feel...terrible. The thing is... with Lara and me... well, you know... No. You'll have to fill me in. Well, the truth is... the truth is, we're the same,\NBridge, you and me. You know? We're two people\Nof a certain age... looking for the moment to commit\Nand finding it really hard. And I just think\Nthat in the end... it's got to be\Nsomething extraordinary... something which makes us\Ngo that extra mile. And I think... Lara and-- I don't know,\Nbeing American and all... it has something to do\Nwith confidence and being so... well, young, you know? Well, we've...become very close. Well, you've only just met her.\NShe flew in yesterday. Uh... Oh. Silly Bridget. You haven't only just met her. DANIEL: No. No. I got to know her\Npretty well... when we were\Nin the New York office together. Oh. Oh, fuck. There's no easy way\Nto say this, but, um... I wanted you to be the first\Nto know that... we're engaged. BRIDGET:\NAt times like this... continuing with one's life\Nseems impossible... and eating the entire\Ncontents of one's fridge... seems inevitable. I have two choices-- to give up and accept permanent\Nstate of spinster hood... and eventual eating by dogs...\Nor not. [Sighs] And this time, I choose not. I will not be defeated... by a bad man\Nand an American stick insect. Instead, I choose vodka... and ChakaKhan.

Why do you want\Nto be in television? Well, I've realized that\NI've become deeply committed... to communicating\Nto the public... the up-to-the-moment\Nand in-depth news... both political and ecological. What do you think of\Nthe El Niño phenomenon? BRIDGET: Um...it's ab lip. I think, basically,\NLatin music is on its way out. So, why do you want\Nto work in television? Because I'm\Npassionately committed... to communicating with children. They are the future. Do you have any children\Nof your own? Oh, Christ, no. Yuck! [Laughs] BRIDGET: Ah. Sorry. MAN: So, why do you want\Nto work in television? I've got to leave my current job\Nbecause I've shagged my boss. Fair enough.\NStart on Monday. We'll see how we go. Oh, and... incidentally... at "Sit Up, Britain"... no one ever gets sacked\Nfor shagging the boss. That's a matter of principle. Oh, Bridget. Come on, it's... I mean, I know it's been\Nawkward as ass... but there's no need to leave. No, actually, there is. I've been offered\Na job in television. Television? Mmm. And they want me\Nto start straight away. So I've got to leave\Nin about, ooh, three minutes... so, um... Whoa. Just hold it\Nright there, Miss Jones. I'm sorry to inform you... but I think you'll find\Nthat by contract... you're expected to give\Nat least six weeks notice. BRIDGET: Ah, yes, well... I thought with the company being\Nin so much trouble and all... you wouldn't really miss... the person who waltzes in\Nin a see-through top... and fannies about\Nwith the press releases. Bridget. I want to hear this,\Nbecause if she gives one inch... I'm going to fire\Nher bony little bottom anyway... for being totally spineless. What? Well, I just think\Nyou should know that, um... there are lots of prospects\Nhere for a talented person. Just give me a minute,\Nwill you, Simon? Thanks. Right-o, boss man. Lots of prospects\Nfor a person who... you know, perhaps\Nfor personal reasons... has been slightly\Noverlooked professionally. Thank you, Daniel.\NThat is very good to know... but if staying here... means working\Nwithin 10 yards of you... frankly, I'd rather have a job\Nwiping Saddam Hussein's ass.

I want you\Nsliding down the pole... and then go straight\Ninto the interview. Great. I'll do it. No problem. Fine. Right. So, you drop into shot... and then interview\NChief Fireman Bevan. Yep, yep, yep. Go, go. Go, go. Go! Go? NEVILLE: Oh, no.\NWe're going to Newcastle first. Stop! Climb back up. On you in thirty seconds. OK. [Grunts] RICHARD: Neville, what\Nthe fuck is going on?

Yes, yes. Uh, tell me, is it\None in four marriages... that ends in divorce now\Nor one in three? One in three. COSMO: Seriously, though. Offices full of single girls\Nin their thirties-- fine physical specimens... but they just can't seem\Nto hold down a chap. WONEY: Yes. Why is it... there are so many unmarried\Nwomen in their thirties... these days, Bridget? [Mark sets down silverware] [Laughs] Oh, I don't know. Suppose it doesn't help\Nthat underneath our clothes... our entire bodies\Nare covered in scales. [Faint laughter] MARK: I very much enjoyed... your Lewis ham fire report,\Nby the way. Thank you. I just... yeah, well. So. It didn't work out\Nwith Daniel Cleaver? No, it didn't. I'm delighted to hear it. Look, are you and Cosmo\Nin this together? I mean, you seem\Nto go out of your way... to try to make me feel\Nlike a complete idiot... every time I see you,\Nand you really needn't bother. I already feel like an idiot\Nmost of the time anyway-- with or without\Na fireman's pole. [Doorbell buzzes] BRIDGET: That'll be my taxi. Good night. Look, um... I'm sorry if I've been... What? I don't think\Nyou're an idiot at all. I mean, there are elements\Nof the ridiculous about you. Your mother's\Npretty interesting. And you really are... an appallingly bad\Npublic speaker. And you tend to let\Nwhatever's in your head... come out of your mouth... without much consideration\Nof the consequences. I realize that when I met you\Nat the turkey curry buffet... that I was unforgivably rude\Nand wearing a reindeer jumper... that my mother had\Ngiven me the day before. But the thing is, um... what I'm trying to say\Nvery inarticulately is... that, um... infact... perhaps, despite appearances... I like you very much. Ah. Apart from the smoking\Nand the drinking... and the vulgar mother\Nand the verbal diarrhea. No. I like you very much--\Njust as you are. Mark, we really are making\Nprogress on the case in here. NATASHA: Jeremy's had\Nthe most brilliant idea. [Snaps fingers]\NMARK: Right. Right. I must go, because... well... bye.

You do know\Nthe Aghani-Heaney case? Yes, of course. Big case... featuring someone\Ncalled Aghanihini. Or two people called\NKafir Aghani and Eleanor Heaney. That's the one. She's a British aid worker.\NHe's a Kurdish freedom fighter. The government\Nwant to extradite him home... where he'll certainly\Nbe executed. She's married to him... and they fought for five years\Nto keep him here. Today is the decision. Oh, that's exciting. Yes, it is...\Nso what are you waiting for?

I don't know.\NI was having a slash. Actually, nobody got interviews. How do you know? Because I was defending him... and I told him\Nnot to give any interviews. Look... MARK: I have a plan. And action. Mr. Darcy,\Nyou were defending Mr. Aghani. You must be delighted. Yes, well, Kafir Aghani\Nhas spent his entire life... defending\Nthe basic human rights... of his own people,\Nand today's verdict... has been the result\Nof five years of struggle... by this woman, Eleanor Heaney... to save the man she loves\Nfrom an extradition order... that would've been tant amount\Nto a death sentence. Right. BRIDGET:\NAnd, Eleanor, over to you. Did you fancy Kafir\Nthe first time that you saw him? [Laughs] This has been Bridget Jones\Nfor "Sit Up, Britain"... with, let's face it,\Na bit of a crush now, actually. Good afternoon. Bridget Jones--\Nalready a legend.

We can have blue soup to start,\Norange pudding to end, and... well, for main course,\Nwe have... uh, congealed green gunge. -That is caper berry gravy.\N-Oh, yes. Yeah. -Do you have eggs?\N-Yes. Right. -Omelet it is, then.\N-Ah. With caper berry gravy. You wouldn't by any chance\Nhave any beet root cubes? A mini-gherkin, stuffed olive? No, Pam, and besides, I'm busy. The gravy needs sieving.

Mark's, obviously. He's never dumped Bridget\Nfor some naked American. And he said he liked her\Njust the way she is. Yeah, but he also shagged\NDaniel's fiancee... and left him broken hearted.

You give the impression\Nof being all moral and noble... and normal... and helpful in the kitchen... but you're just as bad\Nas the rest of them. Well, I can see\Nthat I've been laboring... under a misapprehension. A very, very foolish mistake.\NForgive me. DANIEL: Uhh. Let's go back upstairs. Come on. We belong together, Jones. Me, you. Poor little skirt. Right. If I can't make it with you... I can't make it with anyone. Um... That's not a good enough offer\Nfor me. I'm not willing\Nto gamble my whole life... on someone who's... well, not quite sure. It's like you said. I'm still looking\Nfor something... more extraordinary than that.

I mean, obviously,\Nwith some effort on your part... to pay a bit more attention\Nto me. I do realize\Nwhat I'm like sometimes. It doesn't help\Nthat you and Bridget... have your lovely\Ngrownup club of two... and always saying... "What's silly old Mummy\Ngone and done this time?" You used to be mad about me. You couldn't get enough of me. What do you think? [Breathes deeply] I don't know, Pam. I just don't know now. It's been very hard. [Sobs]\NOh, Colin. [Sobs] I'm joking, you daft cow. Oh!

You know, his Japanese wife\Nleft him on Christmas Day. Cruel race. BRIDGET:\NYes, but I'm not quite sure... he didn't deserve it, actually. She ran off with his best friend\Nfrom Cambridge.
