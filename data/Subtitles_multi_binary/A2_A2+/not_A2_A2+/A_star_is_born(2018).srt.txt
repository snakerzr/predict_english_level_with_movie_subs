Have you been drinking?\NAre you fucked up right now? I'm out a couple. It's the morning. Yup. Hey, buddy. You're nominated\Nfor three Grammys, and it's fucking great. Thank you.\NHow did you find that out? Bobby told me. He called. He said that they wanna do\Nsome Roy Orbison tribute. They want me to sing and shit. - Great.\N- Some like supergroup thing. But the point is, you got\Nnominated, and it's great. I'm just trying to\Nfigure it out, that's all. "Why do you come around me\Nwith an ass like that?" You're saying my lyrics? "Why do you walk around\Nin jeans?" "Why do you wanna come around\Nwith an ass like that?" Yeah, that's my song.\NWhat about my song? I fucking listened to it over\Nand over in the fucking... You're not making any sense. Yeah, just keep drinking. That'll give you the answer. Maybe I just fucking\Nfailed you. - That just kills me. I'm sorry.\N- You what? You failed me?

I'm grateful to... To be here and trying to\Nhold it together. I'm Jack. I'm an alcoholic. Jack. Drug addict. This is all my fault. You don't have\Nthat kind of power, Dad. Eat your dinner.\NEat your food. I don't even know\Nwhat meal it is. Go and have some fruit. How many times did you carry\Nmy piano up the stairs? How many times did you sit\Nthere while I wrote a song? - Always.\N- Okay, it's okay. It's okay. You didn't do anything.\NIt's not your fault. You're just the greatest\Nperson in the world. <i>How long have you\Nbeen here now?</i> <i>Two months.</i> Can it be fixed? Well, you would know that,\Ndon't you? Once it's gone, it's gone. I don't know what you have. Oh, well, the tinnitus,\Nthey say, once you... - Oh, tinnitus can't be fixed.\N- Right. Well, I just hear that tone,\Nthat's all. The tone, yeah. The ringing. I have hearing aids on,\Nas you... No, I know.\NThat's why I asked you. You know, I'm convinced that it happened when I\Nwas younger, I used to... My dad had a Victrola,\Nan old record player. My head was just about the\Nsize of it when I was a kid, and I used to love to just\Nput my whole head in there. He was big into\Nthe blues, so... 'Cause you gotta figure, it's\Njust me and him all day long. My brother's out there tryin'\Nto make something of himself. So I took one of his belts. I put it around\Nthe ceiling fan and tried to do the deed. The whole fucking fan\Ncame out of the ceiling. Had a big cut\Non my fucking forehead. I was more mad about that\Nthan it not working. And he didn't even notice. He didn't even fucking notice. - 'Cause he was drunk?\N- Yeah. That fucking fan stayed on the\Nfloor for about half a year. How old were you then? I was just shy of 13. Aww! You smell good. You smell good,\Nand you look good too. Swimming. I've been swimming. - You've been swimming?\N- Yeah, there's a pool. - I love that you're swimming.\N- Yeah. - That's a great pool there.\N- Yeah. How's Charlie? Oh, Charlie's sweet. He just sort of sits\Nby the door like this. Waiting for daddy. We're both waiting for daddy. What, three weeks? You are gonna\Ncome back, right? What do you mean? You gonna come home\Nwhen you're done? - Do you not want me to?\N- No, I want you to. I'm just wondering if...\NI just... - Where else would I go?\N- I don't know. I guess I just thought...\NYou know, it's like... - There's Jack...\N- Wait, wait, wait. - Why would you say that?\N- I don't know. I guess... I wondered, without the booze, if you would want\Nto come home. 'Cause when you met me,\Nyou were drinking, and now you're not. I wasn't drunk the whole time\Nwe were together. I know, but... But it got bad\Nwhen we were together. It's okay. I mean, it's fine. I just was wondering,\Nthat's all, and whatever you want is okay. Whatever I want?\NI wanna be with you. - That's why I'm here.\N- Okay, I know, I know. I just want you to be happy. I'm working on that. I need to stick with you. I brought something. I wanna know what this is. "My Love." You hiding love songs? No, I wouldn't... I wouldn't say\NI was hiding it. I just... I started puttin' it\Ndown to paper when we were at home. I don't know, it just\Nsort of fell out of me, I guess, and onto this page. And I put it in here,\Nand I thought... I thought\Nmaybe you'd find it when you came\Nback to you, maybe. Well, I found it. Listen. I'm, uh... I'm sorry. It's okay. I... It's okay.\NIt's not your fault. I'm sorry I did that. It's okay. It's not your fault.\NIt's a disease. No, but I embarrassed you. - I embarrassed you, and I...\N- I'm not embarrassed of you. It was so wrong. And then your dad... My father loves you,\Nit's okay. I know, but I... - It's okay.\N- I know, but I... It's okay. It's okay. <i>I have figured out\Nwhat I think is</i> the best solution\Nfor both of us. Jack should come out\Non tour with me. We'll start with our duets.\NI know he's gonna be able to play by himself. You realize\Nthat's not an option. He's so inside of his art\Nin a way he has never been. - He can hear himself again.\N- Ally, there is no way that you can take Jack on tour\Nwith you. There is no way. Do you understand\Nwhat I'm saying? You know what? If you can't\Nmake that happen, then fucking cancel the tour.\NI don't know what to tell you. I think if we had\Na better band name, we might've made it. Or maybe it was 'cause we looked like\Na father and son duo. Not many of those around. I was not a good look for you,\Nthat's for sure. Not my fault I couldn't find\Na better guitar player in the whole goddamn state. Where in the fuck is it? Right here. Thanks for the ride. Sure thing, Jack. Hey, you know, uh...\NWhen I, um... When I said I would...\NYou know, when I... Took your voice, you know. It's you\NI idolized. It wasn't Dad. What was that guy? Hey. Hey. I wanna know\Nhow you hear this. That sounded unbelievable,\Nwhat you were playing. - Thank you.\N- It's nice to hear it. Thank you, and I had the beautiful backdrop\Nof you and Charlie. I only heard it in my mind for so many weeks,\Nso it's good to hear it... The words are beautiful. In the real thing.\NIn the real thing. - Well, you want me to do that?\N- Mmm-hmm. Oh, God, I don't know.\NI knew you were gonna ask me. Back from the dead. Hey, sorry.\NWere you waiting long? Hey, Jack. No, no. Uh... Ally's not home. No, I told her I'd meet her\Nhere, if that's okay. Of course, yeah. Here you go. Hey, thanks for taking care of\Nmy girl when I was gone. Anything for her. She told me about\Nthat European leg. That's a hell\Nof an accomplishment this soon out of the gate. Shit, I remember\Nit was like ten years before I even went\Nacross the pond. It was summer, 2004. Shit, was it? We're not exactly\Nfriends here. While you've been away, we've been back here\Nin serious triage, trying to clean up\Nyour fucking mess. Barely finding\Nour way through it. You almost single-handedly\Nderailed her whole career. You understand that? She's never gonna\Nsay this to you. She loves you too much. Just by staying married to\Nyou, she looks like a joke. It's embarrassing. Let's be honest, we both know\Nit's only a matter of time before that's pushed aside\Nagain for the real thing. And when that happens, I don't want her\Nanywhere near you. Hey. I have some good news. - Yeah?\N- Mmm-hmm. I'm not gonna go to Europe. We're gonna cancel\Nthe rest of the tour, and I'm just gonna\Nbe here all summer. Isn't that great? What happened? Nothing happened. The label just\Nloves the record, and it's doing so well, and they wanna keep\Nwith the momentum and have me make another one. Rez is super psyched,\Nso it'll be great. So tonight's\Ngonna be my last show. Going out with\Na bang at the Forum. Great. Yeah. Why don't you come with me? We can sing "Shallow"\Ntogether. The fans will go crazy\Nto see you. Come on, cowboy. Yeah, why not? Okay. Yeah? Okay, good. I'll have a car come get you. Once I get there. I'll go meet you there. I'll see you soon, okay? Hey. What? I just wanted to take\Nanother look at you. Bye, honey. Bye. Come here, Charlie. Come here. Thank you so much for\Nbringing us all here together. Please look over all of the\Ndancers tonight and the band. And my husband, Jackson. We're so excited for him\Nto be here with us. We got a big night. We're at the Forum.
