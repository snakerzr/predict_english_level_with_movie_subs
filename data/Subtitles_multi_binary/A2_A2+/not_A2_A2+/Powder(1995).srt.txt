And pale eyes\Nthat are usually\Nmore light-sensitive. I want to see him. Greg, you have to remember\Nthat an unborn child experiences everything\Nthat the mother experiences. You take me to him.\NYou show me. (BABY CRYING) (GURGLING) (BABY CRYING) DOCTOR: We'll do everything\Nwe can for him, Greg.\NYou know that. GREG: What are you\Ndoing to him?

Well, I guess if somebody\Nwas going to have to,\NI'm glad it was you. Doug,\NI can hear him again. He's movin' around\Ndown there. Tell me you didn't\Ntry to talk to him. You bet your ass\NI didn't.\NGood. Miss Caldwell. They said a boy, right? I'm guessing\Nthat's what it is. The old man here\Ndied last night. The neighbors\Nfound him this morning. We figure\Nthe kid's his grandson.\NSo where is he? He won't come up\Nfrom the cellar. He didn't report\Nhis grandfather's\Ndeath either. We already know\Nhe died of natural causes. Doug, what am I\Ndoing here? The neighbors say\Nhe may be retarded. One of them says deformed. You know,\Nphysically handicapped. I don't know. I couldn't for the life of me\Nthink of who else to call. He's scared enough,\Nand I thought\Nmaybe you could come down and talk him\Nout of there without us having\Nto go down and drag him out. Jessie, the neighbors\Ntalk about him like he's some\Nkind of a phantom. I haven't met one yet that ever had a good look at him. What are you\Ntelling me, Doug? That the old folks may have\Nkept him down there, like some kind\Nof a family secret. I don't know. Boy? I brought somebody\Nto talk to you. Hello? Hey, my name is Jessie. Are you okay down here? You think we could\Nturn a light on? Hey, if you're afraid,\Nyou don't need to be.\NNot with me. BOY: (SOFTLY)\NI'm not afraid. What's your name? Powder. Is that a name or a nickname? He was getting coffee\Nand he fell. He just... He just\Nfell over and died. I tried to help him. I tried. He...\NDOUG: We know that. Son, I told you,\Nyou're not in any trouble. I'm sorry.\NI just want to see you. Why? Come on.\NNobody's gonna hurt you.\NIt's all right. Give me your hand.\NCome on. What's your real name, son? Jeremy Reed. You've been down here\Nall night, Jeremy. JESSIE:\NYou must be starved. Could you get us\Nsomething to eat? Anything. Sheriff? We'll be all right. Be right back. Why didn't you tell anyone\Nwhen you knew he was dead? Why didn't you\Ncall the police? Grandpa said\Nthere would be a day when he would die, like grandma died, and that people would come and see me and try and take me away. Get back there.\NKeep an ear,\Nbut don't go down. Yes, sir. Lucy, this is Barnum. LUCY:  Go ahead, Sheriff.\NI'm here. We're still out at the Reeds'.\NWe got something out here\Nnobody's gonna believe. You don't live\Ndown here? Mmm. I do most of the work\Naround the place. At least until the sun\Ngets too high. Then the sunglasses\Ndon't even help. Did you know they make\Ncontact lenses now that can protect your eyes\Nfrom the sun all the time? I read about them,\Nbut Grandpa said\Nthey cost too much. When's the last time\Nyou were in school? I've never been to school. I read about it though. But you said you\Nread all these books? Have you read\Nthis book? Well, I know college kids\Nwho couldn't wade\Nthrough this one. Pick a page. Two hundred and sixteen. "Where lies the final harbor,\Nwhence we unmoor no more. "In what rapt ether\Nsails the world of which\Nthe weariest will never weary? "Where is the foundling's\Nfather hidden? "Our souls are like those\Norphans whose unwedded mothers\Ndie in bearing them.

That old man was laying\Ndead there all night. You think the paramedics\Nshowed up this morning\Nand tried paddles on him? Are you telling me the kid\Nelectrocuted the old man? What do you think,\Nhe's Dr. Frankenstein? I'm just sayin' that that's\Nmore than an albino, Doug. That is spooky. I never thought we'd\Nfind a man too white\Nfor you there, Harley.

You need to see him, Aaron,\Nto know what I'm saying. You need to see him sitting\Nout in the hall right now, 'cause I'm telling you,\NI've never seen\Nanything like him. That's exactly what I mean. Because of the way he's lived. Uh, he doesn't seem\Nto know what things are. I mean, things you and I\Ntake for granted, common, everyday objects,\Nsimple ideas... I just don't think\Nhe's ever been\Nexposed to them. I mean, he's about the most\Nwell-read teenage kid\Nyou could ever meet, but in other ways... (WHISPERS)\NI think he's a lot\Nlike a little child.

Something about\Na retarded boy they got\Nup at the state home now. How the hell\Ndid you hear about that? I guess I don't have\Nto tell you what I\Nthink about that. I'd love it if you didn't.\NThe last thing\Nwe need up there is another mental\Ndefective along with\Nall that other trash. (SOFTLY)\NHere you go. I don't know what he is,\Nbut retarded he's not.

In fact, with all that\Nfarm work, I'd say you're\Nin damn fine shape. And the optometrist\Nsaid his contact lenses\Nwill be here the end of the week?\NThey'll be\Ncallin' him Ol' Blue Eyes in time\Nfor the county fair.

You certainly wouldn't\Nbe at an intellectual\Ndisadvantage there, and I know most\Nof the teachers, so... Anyway, um,\Nall I'm saying is, if you'd like to attend\Nschool one day next week,\NI can arrange it. Will my contacts be ready\Nby Monday? (STUDENTS CHATTERING) BOY: Hey, hey, guys... (CHATTERING STOPS) (SOFTLY)\NMolecules. When we speed up the course\Nof molecules, we get... (TAPPING FEET) ...energy. And, um, since we\Nare all basically just a mass of molecules, what does our brain send out\Nto all the other parts\Nof the body? Lindsey? Um, impulses. Yeah.\NElectric impulses. Jeremy, turn your head\Nand look at Lindsey. (STUDENTS SNICKERING) Yes. That's lovely. That's very good.\NYou've just\Nrelayed electricity. Your brain sent out\Nan electric impulse down to your neck muscles and, uh, what, what\Nturned your head, besides the obvious? What your, what your muscles\Nused to turn your head? (SNAPPING FINGERS)\NIt's energy. Energy. Always relaying,\Nalways transforming and never-ending. Now, looky here. This is a, uh,\Na Jacob's Ladder. It's a science fair toy, and it's, uh, built to show us\Nhow electricity travels. Okay? Can we get the, uh, shutters?\NWatch this. STUDENTS: Ooh! Hey, cut it out.\NCut it out. RIPLEY: Ooh, look at this. Blinding, isn't it?\NNow, who can tell me\Nwhy electricity travels? Uh, boredom? (STUDENTS LAUGHING)\NHuh, he tickles me. No. No, potential.\NPotential. One side\Nof this thing is positive,\Nwhile the other side has a strong negative pull. And, uh,\Nthat's all the potential that\Nelectricity needs to travel. That's right. That's pretty good.\NDon't I bring you good,\Nentertaining things? But you get the idea that it\Ndoes... You know, it travels\Nand just keeps going. Did you ever...\NWhat's your experience\Nwith electricity? Did you ever, you know,\Nrun your feet over a carpet\Nlike that and touch somebody? What happens?\NStatic electricity? That's right, that's right.\NNow, where does it go when you touch somebody?\N(PEN SPINNING) It just goes out.\NSo... So, so electricity, like energy, uh,\Njust, um, uh, recycles. (BUZZING LOUDLY)\NIt flows in a cycle\Nthat doesn't end. It, uh... (BUZZING INTENSIFIES) Are you all right? Mr. Ripley? (BUZZING INTENSIFIES) Are you okay?

It was a model.\NFor God sakes, it picked him\Nright out of his seat. What did?\NHold it! Hold it, Doug. The kid doesn't have\Na scratch on him. Heart rate's\Na little irregular, but nothing to indicate\Nthe kind of electrical shock\Nyou're talking about. Right, right!\NAnd he's got a hole, uh,\Nburned in his shirt the size\Nof a bowling ball. (SIGHS) Something's\Nhappened here. Something's happened here.\NI'm telling you, with everything we know\Nabout science, about the makeup\Nof the human body, what happened in that\Nclassroom is impossible! That kid attracted\Nan arc of electricity\Nfrom 30 feet away. And not just\Nfrom the Jacob's Ladder. I mean, after a second,\Nit was like it was comin' at him out\Nof the whole... Building. You want to know why\Nthere isn't a hair on him? DOUG: Why? Because he is electrolysis.\NIt can't grow on him. NURSE: Doc Roth?\NYes? Can I see you\Nfor a minute?\NExcuse me.

LUCY:  Doug. You got a problem\Nwith hospitals in general? I don't like 'em. Well, you can put me\Non that list. Worst day I can remember\Nwas in a hospital. (DOOR OPENS) What day was that? The day I was born. Let me get this straight,\NJeremy. You said that you've never\Nbeen tested for IQ before.\NIs that right? And your grandmother\Ntutored you. Did she ever say\Nanything about it? She said I was\Na fast learner. (LAUGHS)\NYeah. Well, I think\Nthat's about to fall\Ninto the no-shit category. (SIGHS) Jeremy Reed, this is\NDr. Aaron Stipler with\Nthe State Board of Education. Jeremy.\NJESSIE: These men and\Nwomen are here because the results of\Nyour diagnostics came back\Nwith a few surprises. Please, sit down. (SIGHS) Miss Caldwell says\Nyou're a very unique\Nyoung man, Jeremy. Hmm.\NShe also tells me\Nthat, um, reading and your grandparents\Nare the only ways you've\Nexperienced the world. Is that true? What about a radio\Nor, um, a TV set? Surely you've watched some\Ntelevision at some point?\NHe probably couldn't. Didn't your grandparents\Nhave a TV set, Jeremy? I could never\Nwatch television. Are you saying\Nyou weren't allowed? Here,\Nit probably just makes... No.\NOh! I'm saying I could\Nnever watch television. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.\NThat was... That was my fault. I, uh... I was just trying\Nto make them understand. What the good doctor hasn't\Nlet you in on yet is that your test shows that you're a genius. STIPLER: Please! Your IQ scored right\Noff the charts, Jeremy. There isn't even\Na classification for you, it was so high. All of your tests indicate\Nthat you have the most advanced intellect\Nin the history of humankind. Do you understand\Nwhat I'm saying? If you thought I was\Nthat advanced, would you ask me\Nif I understood? (CHUCKLES) Jeremy, these people are\Nin a position to help you. Can they send me home? Can they\Nsend me back?\NNo. I'm sorry. They can't.\NThe fact is, the... The farm's in probate. Do you know\Nwhat that means? "Of or pertaining to probate\Nor a court of probate,\Nexempli gratia, "the official proving\Nof a will as\Nauthentic or genuine."

I have a few more questions\NI have to ask you, Jeremy. You're not here\Nto ask me questions. You're here to find out\Nhow I cheated. That's the only way\Nyou can make sense of it. That's what you need\Nto believe. But I don't need you to\Nbelieve in me, Dr. Stipler. And I'm not interested\Nin any of your tests. I'm not interested in you,\Nor anything else here.

You know,\NI didn't figure it out until enough people\Nlooked at me like I was crazy\Nor told me to act my age, but you, uh, uh, zapped me\Nor I, uh, zapped myself\Nwhen I touched you. But I've been... I've been running\Naround on this high\Nlike I was 18 again. I've had more ideas\Nand more, more focus and better sex\Nthan I've had in 10 years. Do you believe me?\NWell... Why shouldn't you? You know if what I say\Nis bullshit, don't you? So you know when I say\NI'm just here to talk that, uh, that I mean it. Uh, say, did you...\NDid you read any,\Nuh, Einstein? No? Oh, well...\NOh, I think you'd like him. Um, he said he believed\Nin life after death. Only because energy can\Nnever cease to exist. That it relays,\Nit transforms,\Nbut it doesn't stop ever. Uh, and he said that if\Nwe ever got to the point where we could\Nuse all our brain, uh, that we'd be\Npure energy and that we wouldn't\Neven need bodies. Now, um, what would you\Nsay to the possibility that because something\Nhappened to you, uh, something\Nthat never does\Nor isn't supposed to, that you are, are closer\Nto that energy level than any one body\Nhas ever been? I'd say, "So what?" So what? Jeremy, you know,\Nyour life up till now\Nhas been that farmhouse and, uh,\Nand the 12 acres of earth. You know, you've kind\Nof lived in books. But I think you're\Nstarting to find out now\Nthat the misery that you read about\Nis real. The tragedy is, is real\Nin all those stories,\NJeremy. Did you think\Nthat it wasn't? I mean, my God,\Nthat deer hunt... You think that's\Nthe dark side of man?\NKilling for pleasure? I'm sorry.\NI'm really sorry, but you haven't begun\Nto see what we do. We're...

I think that you have\Na mind that, uh, that we won't\Nevolve to for like, uh,\Nthousands of years. You're maybe\Nthe man of the future\Nright here and now. I don't know. And I'm not\Nhere to hurt you. Jeremy, I want\Nto be a friend. (SIGHS) I want\Nto talk with you. Well... I mean,\Ndid you ever have\Na friend? I don't need\Na friend. Really? Gee, I thought\Nyou were a genius. You know\Nwhat I say is true. Are you telling me\Nyou, like, never shook\Nanybody's hand before? Ah, how do you do? Hmm? Now we've been\Nproperly introduced. Want to see a trick? (CHUCKLES) (GASPS) Hmm. Wow. They were afraid\Nto touch me after a while. My grandma and grandpa,\Nthey... They got really scared. What? To touch you? Jeremy,\Nthat's not right. No way. That's not right. (KNOCKING) Doug. You've done a little\Nspring cleaning? What the hell are you\Ndoing here, Doug? A couple of my deputies\Ntold me that Harley Duncan got rid of\Nevery goddamn gun\Nin his house. Said he dropped out\Nof the marksman tourney\Nover in Butte, too. The one he wins\Nevery year. I just ain't huntin'\Nno more, Doug. Is that\Nsome kind of crime? I just got lots\Nof other stuff to do. You gonna\Nstop carrying one\Non the job? If you can't\Npick it up and use it,\Nthat's a liability. I want you\Nto level with me. I already know you snuck off\Nhunting with the boys, which is the last damn thing\Nyou should have done. Yeah, I know. I know. (SIGHS) And I popped this pretty doe,\Njust up at Little Lake. Let me tell you\Nsomething, Doug. You ever tell anybody\NI said this,\NI'm moving out of town. That... Kid? He lays his hand on the deer\Nwhile it's still shakin', and then he touches me\Nat the same time. Now, I can't\Nfigure out why, till my heart starts poundin'\Nand I'm shakin', and I'm feelin' myself\Nhurt and scared shitless, slippin' away\Nin the goddamn dark. That's the worst thing\NI ever felt. It's like I could feel\Nthat animal dyin'. (SCOFFS) It's like I was\Nthe goddamn thing. Aw, come on, Harley.\NDoug, I swear. Now... I just can't do it anymore. I can't look at something down the barrel of a gun\Nwithout thinking about it. I've tried it. I'm telling you,\Nthat thing ain't normal. I'm telling you,\Nhe took whatever was\Nin that goddamn deer, and he put it\Nright into me. (DOOR CREAKING OPEN) DOUG:\NI'm sorry, son. Uh... Jessie said\Nit may be okay for you\Nto come with me. (CAR APPROACHING) (TURNS OFF ENGINE) I don't know\Nwhat it is you do. I'm not even sure\NI believe you can do it. But if you can,\NI need your help. (SIGHS) MAXINE:\NDoug Barnum,\Ndon't you do this. That boy\Nshould not be\Nin this house! (SHUSHING)\NGo to bed, Maxine. If you heard\Nthe stories I've heard, you wouldn't want him\Nin this house! Go on, go on.\NGo back to bed. I'm telling you,\Nthat boy should not be here. Go to bed, Maxine. (SIGHS) She knows you're here. DOUG:\NTalk to me, woman. Tell me what\NI can do for you, Emma. She can't go, not until she knows\Nyou're gonna\Nget through this. She says the both of you. You and Steven. Steven? What the hell\Ndo you want me to do? What should I do? Throw my arms around him? JEREMY: She wants you\Nto remember the snow\Nwhen Steven was younger. And it was snowing. You were all\Nplaying in it. A snowball fight. And she lost her...\NRing. You lost\Nyour wedding ring. You looked\Ndown at your hand,\Nand it was gone. We all looked. Me and Steven,\Nwe dug through the snow\Nall afternoon. He came back\Nfrom school every day, digging through the snow\Nbanks, thinking he'd find it. JEREMY:\NShe cried that you both\Nloved her so much. The way each of you\Nlooked so hard for it. (SIGHS)\NI remember that. I do. JEREMY:\NThe silver box. The silver box on the table. Oh, no, Mama.\NNo. (GASPS) Oh, no. (SOBS) JEREMY: He found it\Nat the old house. In a garden he was tilling. He said he knew right away\Nwhat it was, and that it was time\Nto come home. She says she believes\Nin miracles now... And that you should, too. She thinks I'm an angel come to take her home. And to bring you and Steven\Ntogether again. Remind you how much you're\Nstill in each other's hearts. (GASPS) Everything about each other\Nwe don't like. You know that. He loves you more than\Nany man in the whole world. And she won't go,\Nshe won't leave this place, this room, or this world, until you know\Nthat you still have a son. She'd like to feel\Nthe ring on her finger. You can hear. (SNIFFLING) Oh, it's all right. (CRYING)\NAngel, it's all right. (SIGHS) Good-bye,\NEmma, sweetie. (CAR APPROACHING) Hurry!\NWhat? He's got him\Nup there right now!\NWhat? What is... He's got him up there\Nwith your mama! (PANTING) Papa. (CRYING) (INDISTINCT CHATTERING) LINDSEY:\NWhy don't we just\Ntell them all to stop, and they can just\Ntake a picture\Nor something? Jeremy,\Nare you okay? They're wondering\Nif I killed her. Don't tell me you're\Nseeing inside them again. What are people like\Non the inside? Inside most people\Nthere's a feeling of being separate. Separated from everything. And? And they're not. They're part of absolutely everyone and everything. Everything?\NI'm part of this tree? Part of Zack\Nbarking over fences? You're telling me\Nthat I'm part of some\Nfisherman in Italy on some ocean\NI've never even heard of? Of some guy\Nsitting on death row. I'm part of him,\Ntoo?\NYou don't believe me. It's hard to believe that,\Nall of that. Well, that's because\Nyou have this spot that you can't see past. My grams and gramps\Nhad it. A spot where\Nthey were taught they were disconnected\Nfrom everything. So that's what they'd see\Nif they could? That they're connected? And how beautiful\Nthey really are. And that there's\Nno need to hide or lie. And that it's possible to talk to someone\Nwithout any lies. With no sarcasms, no deceptions,\Nno exaggerations, or any of the things\Nthat people use to confuse the truth. I don't know a single person\Nwho does that. Hold out your hand. Put your fingers up. Wow. Is that your heartbeat? And yours. Wow, this feels strange. You're afraid someone\Nwill see us holding hands. You're really nervous\Ntalking to me. You don't think\Nyou're pretty enough. You feel alone. You feel so alone. Sometimes you just want\Nto break out of yourself. Your father. Your father hurt you\Na long time ago. You're so sad. He made you so sad. He thought you were,\Nyou were ugly and... And he kept\Nsaying you, you weren't... I'm so sorry. Do you? Do you?\NDo I what? Do you think I'm ugly? I don't know what\NI think when I look at you. But sometimes I think, I think you're the most\Nbeautiful face I've ever seen. What? What in the name of God\Ndo you think you're doing? You having a good time\Nwith my daughter? Wonderful. It's a good school... You think\Nthis is funny? Funny man, huh?\NDad! You think this\Nis funny, huh, lover boy?\NWould you stop? Now, I asked\Nyou a question, and I want\Nan answer.\NWould you please... You think it's funny? Dad, he wasn't\Ndoing anything! KELLOWAY: Answer me!\NMr. Kelloway. Let him go. I said, "Let him go."\NDick Kelloway, you take\Nyour hands off him now! I thought your boys had\Nrules about fraternizing.\NI said now. Keep your state trash\Naway from my daughter. Christ, you know\Nnothing happened. Is that\Nyour expert opinion? You keep\Nthat thing on a leash, or I'll slap a lawsuit\Non that state zoo that will shut it down\Nso fast it will make\Nyour head spin. I am so sorry. Powder.

Peeping tom faggot, maybe. You were gettin'\Nan eyeful of him,\Nweren't you, light bulb? You want to see what\Na real man looks like? Huh? You think you\Ncan take me,\Nfreak show, go for it. In the meantime... I keep the hat. When you think you're\Nman enough to get it back,\Nyou take your best shot. You think you're\Nman enough to get it back? You take your best shot,\Ntough stuff. What did you say? I'd beat you to shit before\Nyou got this old hat back. That's what\Nhe said to you\Nwhen he was drunk. You were 12 years old,\Nand he took\Nyour father's hat. It's the only thing your\Nreal father ever left behind. Your stepdad, John. That's what he said to you. "You think you're\Nman enough to get it back? "Then take your best shot,\Ntough stuff." And then he beat you bloody\Nthat night when you tried. Hey, fuck you! You had marks so dark,\Nyou were embarrassed to suit up for gym. I ought to kill you\Nright now, man. I ought to\Nslit your throat and spit down it\Nwhile I'm doing it. (THUNDER RUMBLING) Well, what do you know. Boogeyman's afraid\Nof lightning. What's the matter,\Nfreak show? MITCH: Leave him alone,\NJohnny! Jesus Christ! He's scared to death!\NBullshit, Mitch! He got a free show.\NNow we get one. (LAUGHING) Now that is white! Look at that. You're as bald as a baby. He needs some color. Doesn't he need\Nsome color? You definitely need\Nsome color, buddy. (GASPING) JOHN: Go get him. (THUNDER RUMBLING) Do it! Now you got\Nsome color.\NThat's enough, John.

Why don't you look\Nat me and say something? (SIGHING) Jeremy, listen. From the first moment\NI saw you down here, scared in the dark,\NI had this feeling that... That you would change\Neverything I knew. And maybe this is not\Nthe right place for someone\Nas beautiful as you. But if you come with me, I promise you we'll\Nfind a place that is. (FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING) Let's go. (CAR DOOR CLOSING) (THUNDER RUMBLING) (SIGHING) Donald. Just let him come on down,\NMiss Caldwell. We don't want\Nno trouble from you.
