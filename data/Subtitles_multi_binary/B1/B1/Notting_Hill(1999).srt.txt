World of Warcraft-EU *Stormscale = Torporr, Terenas = Bokutox*  [ Shouting ] [ Shouting, Whistling ] [ Man ] So stay with us\Nbecause later this afternoon, we're lucky enough\Nto be talking to Anna Scott, Hollywood's biggest star by far. Miss Scott's latest film\Nis once again topping the charts. - [ Piano ]\N- [ Man Continues, Indistinct ] She may be the face\NI can't forget A trace of pleasure or regret May be my treasure or the price I have to pay She may be the mirror Of my dream A smile reflected in a stream She may not be what she may seem Inside her shell She who always seems\Nso happy in a crowd Whose eyes can be\Nso private and so proud No one's allowed\Nto see them when they cry She may be the love\Nthat cannot hope to last May come to me\Nfrom shadows of the past That I'll remember till the day I die She may be the reason I survive The why and wherefore I'm alive The one I'll care for\Nthrough the rough And ready years Me, I'll take her laughter\Nand her tears And make them all my souvenirs For where she goes I've got to be The meaning of my life is She She Oh, she [ Man Narrating ]\NOf course I've seen her films... and always thought\Nshe was, well, fabulous. But, you know, a million, million miles\Nfrom the world I live in... which is here, Notting Hill,\Nmy favorite bit of London. There's the market on weekdays selling\Nevery fruit and vegetable known to man. Rock hard bananas,\Nfive for a pound! The tattoo parlor\Nwith a guy outside who got drunk... and now can't remember\Nwhy he chose "I love Ken." The radical hairdressers\Nwhere everyone comes out\Nlooking like the Cookie Monster, whether they want to or not. And then, suddenly,\Nit's the weekend, and from break of day hundreds\Nof stalls appear out of nowhere, filling Portobello Road,\Nright up to Notting Hill Gate. And wherever you look thousands of\Npeople are buying millions of antiques, some genuine and some...\Nnot quite so genuine. And what's great is that lots of friends\Nhave ended up in this part of London. That's Tony, for example,\Narchitect turned chef, who recently invested all the money\Nhe ever earned in a new restaurant. And so, this is where\NI spend my days and years... in this small village in the middle of\Nthe city in a house with a blue door... that my wife and I bought together\Nbefore she left me for a man... who looked exactly like Harrison Ford. And where I lead a strange half-life\Nwith a lodger called-- Spike! You couldn't help me with an incredible\Nimportant decision, could you? Is this important in comparison to,\Nlet's say, whether they should cancel\NThird World debt? That's right. I am at last going out\Non a date with the great Janine, and I just wanna be sure\NI've picked the right T-shirt. - What are the choices?\N- Well, wait for it. First there's this one.\N[ Growls ] Cool, huh? Yeah, it might make it hard\Nto strike a really romantic note. Point taken.\NDon't despair. If it's romance we're looking for,\NI believe I have just the thing. Yeah, well, there again, she might not\Nthink you had true love on your mind. Right.\NJust one more. True love here I come. Well, yeah. Yeah, that's--\Nthat's, um, perfect. Great. Thanks. - Wish me luck.\N- Good luck. [ Narrating ] And so it was\Njust another hopeless Wednesday, as I walked the thousand yards\Nthrough the market to work, never suspecting that this was the day\Nthat was gonna change my life forever. This is work, by the way,\Nmy little travel bookshop, - Morning, Martin.\N- Morning, Monsignor. which, um, well, sells travel books, and to be frank with you,\Ndoesn't always sell many of those. Classic.\NProfit from major sales push, minus 347 pound. Shall I, uh,\Ngo and get you a cappuccino? - You know, ease the pain a bit.\N- Yeah, yeah. Better make it a half.\NAll I can afford. Get your logic.\NDemi-cappu coming right up. [ Doorbell Dings ] Um, can I help you at all? No, thanks.\NI'll just... look around. Fine. Uh, that book's really not great. Just in case, you know, browsing turned\Nto buying. You'd be wasting your money. But if it's Turkey\Nyou're interested in, um, this one, on the other hand,\Nis very good. Um, I think the man who wrote it has\Nactually been to Turkey, which helps. Um, there's also\Na very amusing incident with a kebab, um, which is one\Nof many amusing incidents. Thanks.\NI'll think about it. Or, in the bigger hardback variety,\Nthere's-- I'm sorry.\NCan you just give me a second? Excuse me. - Yes?\N- Bad news. What? We've got a security camera\Nin this bit of the shop. So? So I saw you put that book\Ndown your trousers. - What book?\N- The one down your trousers. I don't have a book\Ndown my trousers. Right. I tell you what.\NUm, I'll call the police, and, um, if I'm wrong about the whole\N"book down the trousers" scenario, I really apologize. Okay. What if... I did\Nhave a book down my trousers? Well, ideally,\Nwhen I went back to the desk, you'd remove the Cadogan Guide\Nto Bali from your trousers... and either wipe it\Nand put it back or buy it. I'll see you in a sec. I'm sorry about that. No, it's fine. I was gonna steal one,\Nbut now I've changed my mind. Oh, signed by the author,\NI see. Um, yeah, couldn't stop him. If you can find an unsigned one,\Nit's worth an absolute fortune. - [ Chuckles ]\N- Excuse me. - Yes?\N- Can I have your autograph? Uh, sure. - Uh--\N- Here. - What's your name?\N- Rufus. What does it say? That's my signature. And above it, it\Nsays, "Dear Rufus, you belong in jail." Good one. - Do you want my phone number?\N- Tempting. But... no.\NThank you. I will take this one. Oh, right, right.\NSo, uh-- Well, on second thoughts,\Num, maybe it's not that bad after all. Actually, it's a sort\Nof a classic, really. None of those childish kebab stories\Nyou find in so many books these days. And, um, I tell you what. I'll throw in\None of those for free. Useful for, uh, lighting fires, wrapping fish,\Nthat sort of thing. - Thanks.\N- Pleasure. [ Door Closes ] Cappuccino, as ordered. Thanks. I don't think you'll believe\Nwho was just in here. Who?\NWas it someone famous? - No, no, no.\N- No? Would be exciting, though,\Nwouldn't it, if someone famous\Ncame into the shop? Hmm? Do you know--\Nand this is pretty amazing, actually-- but I once saw Ringo Starr. - Where was that?\N- Kensington High Street. At least I think it was Ringo. It might have been that man\Nfrom Fiddler on the Roof. - You know, Toppy.\N- Topol. Yes, that's right.\NTopol. Mm-hmm. Actually, Ringo Starr doesn't--\Ndoesn't look at all like, uh, Topol. Yeah, but he was--\Nhe was quite a long way away from me. So actually it could've\Nbeen neither of them. Yes, I suppose so, yes. - It's not a classic anecdote, is it?\N- Not a classic, no. No. - Another one?\N- [ Sighs ] Yes. No. Let's go crazy.\NI'll have an orange juice. [ People Chattering ] - Okay, thanks. Bye-bye.\N- See you later. - Oh!\N- Oh! Shit! - Oh, my God!\N- Bugger! I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. - Here. Let me--\N- Get your hands off! I'm really sorry.\NI-- I live just over the street. I have, um, water and soap.\NYou can get cleaned up. No, thank you.\NI just need to get my car back. I also have a phone.\NI'm confident that in five minutes... we could have you spick-and-span\Nand back on the street again. In the non-prostitute sense,\Nobviously. All right. Well-- What do you mean,\N"just over the street"? - Give it to me in yards.\N- Uh, 18 yards. That's my house there\Nwith the blue front door. Come on in.\NI'll just-- I'll just-- Um, right. Right.\NCome in. It's, um, not quite as tidy\Nas it normally is, I fear. But, um--\NThe bathroom's on the top floor. And the telephone's just--\Njust up here. Here.\NLet-- Let me, um-- Um, round the corner.\NStraight on-- straight on up. Bugger. [ Groans ] Uh-oh. Uh, would you like a cup of tea\Nbefore you go? - No.\N- Coffee? - No.\N- Orange juice? Probably not.\NUm, something else cold. Uh-- - [ Bottles Rattling ]\N- Coke? Water? Some disgusting sugary drink... pretending to have something to do\Nwith fruits of the forest? - No.\N- Would you like something to eat? Uh, something to nibble? Um, apricots soaked in honey? Quite why, no one knows, because\Nit stops them tasting of apricots... and makes them taste like honey, and if you wanted honey, you'd just\Nbuy honey instead of... apricots. Um, but nevertheless,\Nthere we go there. They're yours if you want them. No. Do you always say "no"\Nto everything? No. I'd better be going. Thanks for your, uh, help. You're welcome. And, uh, may I also say,\Num, heavenly. I'll just take\Nmy one chance to say it. After you've read\Nthat terrible book, you're certainly not going\Nto be coming back to the shop. Thank you. Yeah.\NWell, my pleasure. So... it was nice to meet you. Surreal but, um-- but nice. Sorry. [ People Chattering Outside ] "Surreal but nice"?\NWhat was I thinking? [ Doorbell Rings ] - Hi.\N- Hi. - I forgot my other bag.\N- Oh, right. Right. Thanks. I'm very sorry about\Nthe "surreal but nice" comment. - Disaster.\N- That's okay. I thought the apricot and honey thing\Nwas the real low point. - [ Chuckles ]\N- [ Doorknob Rattling ] Oh, my God.\NMy flatmate. I'm sorry.\NThere's no excuse for him. [ Clears Throat ] - Hey.\N- Hi. I'm just going into the kitchen\Nto get some food. Then I'm gonna tell you a story\Nthat will make your balls shrink\Nto the size of raisins. Probably best\Nnot to tell anyone about this. Right. Right.\NNo one. I mean, I'll tell myself sometimes. But don't worry.\NI won't believe it. - Bye.\N- Bye. There's something wrong\Nwith this yogurt. It's not yogurt.\NIt's mayonnaise. Oh, right.\NThere we are then. Mm. On for a videofest tonight? I got some absolute classics. - Smile.\N- No. - Smile.\N- I've got nothing to smile about. Okay. In about seven seconds, I'm going to ask you\Nto marry me. [ Spike ]\NImagine. Somewhere in the world\Nthere's a man who's allowed to kiss her. [ Both Laughing ] Yes, she is, uh, fairly fabulous. - Do you have any books by Dickens?\N- No. No, I'm afraid we're a travel bookshop.\NWe only sell travel books. Oh, right. How about\Nthe new John Grisham thriller? Well, no, 'cause that's, uh--\Nthat's a novel too, isn't it? Oh, right. [ Sighs ]\NHave you got Winnie the Pooh? Martin, your customer. - Uh, can I help you?\N- [ Bell Dinging ] [ Pop ] Once in a lifetime - [ Continues ]\N- Hey. Hi. - Once in a lifetime\N- Just, um, incidentally, uh, why...\Nare you wearing that? Combination of factors really.\NUh, no clean clothes. There never will be, you know,\Nunless you actually clean your clothes. Right.\NVicious circle. And I was, like,\Nrooting around in your things... and I found this,\Nand I thought "cool." Kinda... spacey. There's something wrong\Nwith the goggles, though. No, they were, um, prescription. - Groovy.\N- So I could see all the fishes properly. You should do more\Nof this stuff. - So, look, any messages today?\N- Yeah, I wrote a couple down. So there were two.\NThere were two messages? Right? You want me to write down\Nall your messages? Okay, who are the ones\Nthat you didn't write down from? [ Sighs ] No. Gone completely. Oh, no.\NThere was one from your mum. She said don't forget lunch,\Nand her leg's hurting again. - No one else?\N- Absolutely no one else. Though if we're going for this obsessive\Nwriting down all the message thing, some American girl called Anna\Ncalled a few days ago. - What did she say?\N- Well, it was genuinely bizarre. She said, "Hi. It's Anna."\NThen she said, "Call me at The Ritz"... and then gave herself\Na completely different name. - Which was?\N- Absolutely no idea. Remembering one name's hard enough. No, I-- I know that.\NShe-- She said that. Um, I know she's using another name. The problem is\Nshe left the message with my flatmate... which was a very serious mistake. Um, I don't know. Imagine, if you will,\Nthe stupidest person you've ever met. - Are you doing that?\N- Yes, sir, I have him in my mind. And now double it.\NAnd that is the, um-- what can I say-- the git that I am living with. And he can't remember-- - Try Flintstone.\N- I'm sorry, what? I think she said\Nher name was Flintstone. I don't-- I don't suppose, um,\NFlintstone rings any bells, does it? - Oh, I'll put you right through, sir.\N- Oh, my God. Hello. Hi. - Hi there.\N- Hello? Hi. Hi. - Sorry. It's William... Thacker.\N- Yes? Um, we-- I work in a bookshop. Uh-huh. You played it pretty cool there,\Nwaiting for three days to call. Oh, no, I promise you I've never played\Nanything cool in my entire life. My flatmate, who'll I'll stab to death\Nlater, never gave me the message. I don't know.\NPerhaps, um, I could drop round\Nfor tea later or something. - Things are pretty busy here.\NI might be free around 4:00.\N- Right. Right. Great. - Bye.\N- Yea-- Bye. [ Phone Clicks, Dial Tone ] Classic. Classic. [ Piano ] [ Continues ] - Which floor?\N- Three, please. [ Elevator Dings ] Uh, are you sure this is-- Oh, yeah. Yeah. Sure. - Hi. Hi. I'm Karen.\N- Hi. I'm sorry.\NThings are running a little bit late. Here's the, uh, thing.\NDo you wanna come this way? [ Karen ]\NThrough here. [ Reporters Chattering ] So what did you\Nthink of the film? Yeah, I thought it was fantastic.\NI thought it was, uh, Close Encounters\Nmeets Jean de Florette. I agree. I'm sorry. I didn't get down\Nwhat magazines you're from. - Time Out.\N- Great. And you're from? Uh, Horse & Hound. The name's William Thacker. I think,\Nactually, she might be expecting me. Oh, okay.\NTake a seat and I'll go check. I see you've, uh--\NI see you've brought her some flowers. [ Laughing ]\NNo. These are for my,\Num, grandmother. She's in a hospital\Njust down the road. Thought I'd kill two birds\Nwith one stone, you know. Sure, right.\NAbsolutely. Yeah. Yeah. Which hospital's that? Do you mind me not saying? It's a rather distressing disease. - Name of the hospital\Nkind of gives it away.\N- Absolutely. Sure. Cheers.\NOoh, yes. Right, uh, Mr.Thacker.\NWill you come this way. Right. You've got five minutes. - Hi.\N- Hello. Uh, I brought these, but clearly-- No, they're great.\NThey're great. Ah, listen,\NI'm sorry about not ringing back. The whole "two-names concept"... was totally too much for my flatmate's\Npea-sized intellect. No, it's a stupid privacy thing.\NI always pick a... cartoon character. Last time I was Mrs.Bambi. [ Door Closes ] - Everything all right?\N- Yes, thank you. And you're from, uh,\NHorse & Hound. - Yeah.\N- Good. Is that so? Well. So, uh-- Uh, I'll just... fire away then,\Nshall I? Right. Uh-- The film's great, and, um, I just was wondering whether... you ever thought of having, um, more, uh, horses in it. [ Clears Throat ] Uh, well, we would have liked to, but it was, um, difficult,\Nobviously, being set in space. Space, right, yeah.\NYeah, obviously very difficult. I'm so sorry.\NI arrived outside. They thrust this thing\Ninto my hand-- No, it's my fault.\NI thought this would all be over by now. I just wanted to sort of apologize\Nfor the kissing thing. I seriously don't know\Nwhat came over me. And I just wanted to make sure\Nthat you were fine about it. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. Absolutely fine.\N- [ Door Closes ] Do remember that Miss Scott is also\Nkeen to talk about her next project... which is, um, shooting\Nlater in the summer. Ah, yes, excellent.\NExcellent. Any horses in that one? Or hounds for that matter. Our readers\Nare equally intrigued by both species. It takes place on a submarine. Oh. Well, bad luck. But, um, if there were horses in it, would you be riding them... or would you be getting, a--\Na stunt-horse-double-man-thing? [ Chuckles ] I-I'm a complete moron.\NI apologize. I-- This is very weird. It's the sort\Nof thing that happens in dreams, not in real life. I mean, good dreams.\NIt's a-- It's a dream, in fact,\Nuh, to see you again. What happens next in the dream? I suppose in the, uh, dream-- dream scenario--\NI just, uh, change my personality... because you can do that\Nin dreams and, um, walk over and, uh, kiss the girl. But, uh-- Time's up, I'm afraid.\NDid you get what you wanted? - Um, nearly, nearly.\N- Well, maybe just one last question. - Um, nearly, nearly.\N- Well, maybe just one last question. - Sure. [ Clears Throat ]\N- Right, right. [ Door Closes ] Are you... busy tonight? - Yes.\N- Right. Right. - Come in.\N- Well, it was nice to meet you. Yes, and you. Surreal... but nice. Thank you. You are Horse & Hounds'\Nfavorite actress. You and Black Beauty... tied. How was she? Oh, um, fabulous. Excellent. Wait a minute.\NShe took your grandmother's flowers. Uh, yeah, yeah.\NThat's right. - Bitch.\N- [ Karen ] Oh, Mr.Thacker. Mr.Thacker, if you'd like to come with\Nme, we can rush you through the others. The others? Mr.Thacker is from Horse & Hound. - How's it going?\N- Very well, thank you. Have a seat. - Well, did you enjoy the film?\N- [ Clock Ticking ] Yes, enormously. - Well, fire away.\N- Right. Did you enjoy making the film? - Yes, I did.\N- Good. Any bit in particular? You tell me what bit\Nyou enjoyed the most, and I'll tell you\Nif I enjoyed making that bit. Uh, I... liked the bit in space... very much. Did you identify with the character\Nyou're playing? [ Speaking Spanish ] - No.\N- No. Oh. Why not? [ Spanish ] [ Spanish ] Because he's playing\Na psychopathic flesh-eating robot. Classic. So, uh, is this your first film? No. It's my 22nd. Of course it is.\NAny favorites among the 22? Working with Leonardo. - Da Vinci?\N- DiCaprio. Of course.\N[ Chuckles ] And is-- is he your favorite\NItalian director? [ Reporters Chattering ] - Mr.Thacker.\N- Oh, no. - Have you got a minute?\N- No. Hi. Hi. Um-- Yeah, so the, um-- the-- the thing I was doing tonight,\NI'm not doing anymore. I told them I had\Nto spend the evening... with Britain's premier\Nequestrian journalist. Oh. Well, great. Fantastic.\NThat's, uh-- Oh. Shittity brickitty. It's my sister's birthday. Shit.\NWe're meant to be having dinner. - Okay, that's fine.\N- No. I'm sure I can get out of it. No, I mean, if it's fine with you,\NI'll be your date. You--\NYou'll be my date... to my little sister's\Nbirthday party? - If it's all right.\N- Well, yeah, I'm sure it's all right. My friend Max is cooking, and he is generally acknowledged\Nto be the worst cook in the world. But, um, you know, you could hide\Nthe food in your handbag or something. - Okay.\N- Okay. - He's bringing a girl?\N- Miracles do happen. - Does the girl have a name?\N- Don't know. Wouldn't say. Oh, Christ!\NWhat is going on in there? - [ Doorbell Rings ]\N- Oh, God! Hi. Come on in.\NVague food crisis. Hiya! Sorry. The guinea-fowl is proving\Nmore complicated than expected. - He's cooking guinea-fowl?\N- Don't even ask. - Hi.\N- Hi. Good Lord,\Nyou're the spitting image of-- Bella, this is Anna. - Right.\N- Okay, crisis over. Max, this is Anna. - Hi.\N- Hello, Anna-- Scott.\NHave some wine. Thank you. - [ Doorbell Rings ]\N- I'll get it. Red or white? - Oh. Hey.\N- Hi. - Oh, yes, happy birthday.\N- Thank you. Look, your brother's\Nbrought this girl. Hi, guys. Oh, holy fuck! Hon, this is Anna. Anna, this is Honey.\NShe's my baby sister. Oh. Hi. Oh, God. This is one\Nof those key moments in life... when it's possible\Nyou can be really genuinely cool... and I-- I'm going to fail\Njust a hundred percent. I-- I absolutely,\Ntotally and utterly adore you. And I just think... you are\Nthe most beautiful woman in the world. And, more importantly,\NI genuinely believe, and I've believed for some time now,\Nthat we could be best friends. So what do you think? [ Chuckles ] Uh, lucky me. [ Clears Throat ]\NWell, happy birthday. Oh, you gave me a present.\NWe're best friends already then. Marry Will. He's a really nice guy.\NThen we can be sisters. - Well, I'll think about it.\N- [ Chuckles ] - [ Doorbell Rings ]\N- That'll be Bernie. - Hi.\N- Hi. Sorry I'm late. Bollocksed up at work again, I fear. - Millions down the drain.\N- Well done. - Bernie, this is Anna.\N- Hello, Anna. Delighted to meet you. - And you.\N- Honey bunny, Happy birthday to you - Hi, Bella.\N- Hi. Um, it-- it-- it's a hat.\NYou don't have to wear it or anything. - Hi, Will.\N- Hi. Hi. - Hi.\N- What? - Wine, Bernie?\N- Mm. - [ Cork Pops ]\N- You haven't slept with her, have you? That is a cheap question, and\Nthe answer is, of course, no comment. - No comment means "yes."\N- No, it doesn't. - Do you ever masturbate?\N- Definitely no comment. - You see, it means "yes."\N- [ Honey ] Oh, my God! So, uh, tell me,\Num, Anna, what do you do? - I'm an actress.\N- Oh, splendid. What do you do? I'm actually in the stock market myself,\Nso, uh, not really similar fields. Though, um-- um, I have done\Nthe odd bit of amateur stuff. Um-- uh, P.G. Wodehouse.\NFarce, all that, you know. "Careful there, Vicar." Always imagined it's a pretty tough job,\Nthough, acting. - The wages are a scandal, aren't they?\N- They can be. I see friends from university--\Nclever chaps. Been in the business longer than you. They're scraping by on seven,\Neight thousand a year. You know, it's no life. - What sort of acting do you do?\N- Films, mainly. Oh, splendid. Oh, well done.\NHow's the pay in movies? I mean, last film you did,\Nwhat did you get paid? Fifteen million dollars. Right. So that's, well, fairly good. Right, I think we're ready. - Ooh.\N- Okay. Bella, can you tell me\Nwhere I can find-- Oh, sorry.\NIt's down the corridor on the right. I'll show you. [ Whispering ] Quickly, quickly.\NTalk very, very quickly. What are you doing here\Nwith Anna Scott? - Anna Scott?\N- Yes. Shut up! - What, the film star?\N- Shh! - Oh, God!\N- What? - Oh, God. Oh, goddy God.\N- What did you say to her? I don't believe it.\NI actually walked into the loo with her. I was still chatting\Nwhen she started unbuttoning her jeans. - She had to ask me to leave.\N- Oh, God. - [ Laughing ]\N- So you knew who she was? Of course I did, but he didn't. Well, not instantly, but I-- I--\NI got away with it. [ All Chattering ] - What do you think of the guinea-fowl?\N- I'm a vegetarian. Oh, God. So, how's the guinea-fowl? Best guinea-fowl\NI've ever tasted. It's amazing how you - Can speak right to my heart\N- [ All Chattering ] Without saying a word You can light up the dark - [ Hands Clapping ]\N- Try as I may, I can never explain - What I hear when you\Ndon't say a thing\N- [ Party Poppers Popping ] Having you here, Anna, firmly\Nestablishes what I've long suspected-- that we really are the most\Ndesperate lot of underachievers. - [ Bernie ] Shame.\N- I'm not saying it's a bad thing. In fact, I think it's something\Nwe should take pride in. I'm gonna give the last brownie\Nas a prize... to the saddest act here. - Uh-oh.\N- Bern. Yeah, all right.\NWell, obviously, it's me, isn't it? I mean, I work in the city in a job\NI don't understand, and everyone keeps\Ngetting promoted above me. I haven't had a girlfriend since--\Nwell, since puberty. And... nobody fancies me. And if these cheeks get any chubbier,\Nthey never will. - Nonsense. I fancy you.\N- Really? Yeah. Or I did\Nbefore you got so fat. [ Max ] You see.\NAnd unless I'm much mistaken, your job still pays you\Nrather a lot of money... whilst Honey here\Nearns 20 pence a week... flogging her guts out\Nin London's worst record store. Yes! And I haven't got hair.\NI've got feathers. And I've got funny goggly eyes.\NAnd I'm attracted to cruel men. And, actually,\Nno one will marry me... because, um, my boosies\Nhave actually started shrinking. - [ Max ] You see, it's incredibly sad.\N- But on the other hand, her best friend is Anna Scott. That's true. I can't deny it.\NShe needs me. What can I say? And most of her limbs work, whereas\NI'm stuck in this thing day and night, in a house full of ramps. And to add insult\Nto serious injury, I've totally given up smoking,\Nmy favorite thing. And, um, well, the truth is, we can't have a baby. Oh, Belle. C'est la vie. Still, um, we're lucky in lots of ways. But surely that's worth a brownie.\N[ Chuckling ] Well, I don't know.\NLook at William. - Very unsuccessful professionally.\N- That's true. Divorced. Used to be handsome,\Nnow kind of squidgy round the edges. And absolutely certain never\Nto hear from Anna again... - once she's heard that his\Nnickname at school was--\N- Floppy. You did.\NI can't believe it, you did. Thanks very much. Thank you.\NWell, at least I get the last brownie. [ Max ]\NI think so, yes. Well, wait.\NWhat about me? I'm sorry?\NYou think you deserve the brownie? [ Chuckles ]\NWell, a shot at it at least, huh? You'll have to prove it.\NThis is a very, very good brownie. I'm gonna fight for it. I've been on a diet\Nevery day since I was 19, which basically means\NI've been hungry for a decade. [ All Laughing ] I've had a series of not-nice\Nboyfriends, one of whom hit me. Uh, and every time\NI get my heart broken, the newspapers splash it about\Nas though it's entertainment. And... it's taken two rather painful,\Num, operations... to get me looking like this. - Really?\N- Really. And one day not long from now,\Nmy looks will go, they will discover I can't act, and I will become\Nsome sad, middle-aged woman... who... looks a bit like someone\Nwho was famous for a while. No, nice try, gorgeous,\Nbut you don't fool anyone. - [ All Laughing ]\N- No. Pathetic effort\Nto hog the brownie. - Thank you for such a terrific time.\N- I'm delighted. - That's a great tie.\N- Now you're lying. Okay, it's true.\NI told you I was bad at acting. - It was lovely to meet you.\N- Yeah, and you. And you. I'll wait until you've gone\Nbefore I tell him you're a vegetarian. - No!\N- [ Chuckling ] Oh! - Good night.\N- I'm so sorry about the loo thing. I meant to leave.\NI just-- [ Chuckles ] Ring me if you want someone\Nto go shopping with. I know lots of nice, cheap places,\Nnot that money is necessarily-- It was just so nice to meet you. - Happy birthday. You're my style guru.\N- Thank you. - Sorry. Can I just--\N- Oh. - Thanks.\N- Leave her. - Good night, everyone.\N- Bye. [ William ] Max, Belle,\Nwe'll see you in a couple of days. - Thank you, everybody. Call us.\N- Bye, guys. - Bye, Anna.\N- Love your work. [ William ]\NBye, Hon. [ Screaming, Shouting ] [ Screaming, Shouting Continue ] Sorry. They always do that\Nwhen I leave the house. It's a stupid thing.\NI hate it. - "Floppy," huh?\N- It's the hair. - Mm-hmm.\N- It's to do with the hair. Why is she in a wheelchair? Uh, because she had an accident\Nabout 18 months ago. And the pregnancy thing,\Nis that to do with the accident? You know, I'm not sure. I don't think they tried for kids\Nbefore, as fate would have it. Do you want to, um-- My place is just, um-- Too complicated. That's fine. [ Chuckles ] Busy tomorrow? - I thought you were leaving tomorrow.\N- I was. All these streets round here\Nhave these mysterious communal gardens\Nin the middle of them. - They're like little villages.\N- Let's go in. Ah, no, that's the point.\NThey're private villages. Only the people who live round the edges\Nare allowed in. Oh. You abide by rules like that? I don't. No, no.\NBut others do. I just do what I want.\N[ Shakes Railing ] Um-- Right. - Whoopsidaisies.\N- [ Laughing ] What did you say? - Nothing.\N- Yes, you did. - No, I didn't.\N- You said, "Whoopsidaisies." No one says, "Whoopsidaisies," do they?\NI mean, unless they're-- There is no "unless." Because no one\Nhas said "Whoopsidaisies" for 50 years. And even then it was-- it was just\Nlittle girls with blonde ringlets. Exactly. Right.\NSo here we go again. - Oh! Oh! Whoopsidaisies.\N- [ Laughing ] Yeah, well, it's a disease.\NIt's a clinical thing. I'm taking pills and having injections.\NAnd I'm told it won't last long. - Okay, stand aside.\N- I don't think that's a good idea. Really, it's quite, um, tricky.\NAnna. Anna, don't. It's harder than it--\NNo, it's not. It's easy. [ Birds Chirping ] Come on, Flopsy. Right. All right. [ Grunts ]\NOh, bugger. Oh, God,\Nthis could be very unpleasant. Ay!\NBugger, bugger. Now what in the world in this garden\Ncould make that ordeal worthwhile? It's amazing how you Can speak right to my heart Nice garden. Without saying a word You can light up the dark - [ Anna Laughs ]\N- Try as I may, I can never explain What I hear\Nwhen you don't say a thing - You say it best\N- You say it best When you say nothing at all "For June who loved this garden. From Joseph who always sat beside her." Some people do spend\Ntheir whole lives together. All day long I can hear People talking out loud - But when you hold me near\N- When you hold me near - You drown out the crowd\N- Out the crowd - Try as they may\Nthey can never define\N- Come and sit with me. What's been said\Nbetween your heart and mine The smile on your face\Nlets me know that you need me There's a truth in your eyes - Saying you'll never leave me\N- Bollocks! Bollocks! - Have you seen my glasses?\N- No, afraid not. Big, big bollocks!\NAverage day, my glasses are everywhere. Everywhere I look\Nthere's a pair of glasses. But when I want to go to the cinema,\Nthey've vanished. It's one of life's real cruelties. That's compared to, like,\Nearthquakes in the Far East\Nor testicular cancer, is it? Oh, shit.\NIs that the time? - [ Continues ]\N- Thanks for all your help\Non the glasses thing. Oh, you're welcome.\NDid you find them? - Sort of.\N- Great. Oh, the smile on your face\Nlets me know that you need me There's a truth in your eyes Saying you'll never leave me The touch of your hand says\Nyou'll catch me wherever I fall So who left who? - Uh, she left me.\N- Why? - She saw through me.\N- Uh-oh. That's not good. You can give me\NAnna Scott any day. I didn't like her last film. Fell asleep\Nas soon as the lights went down. I don't really care\Nwhat the film's like. Any film with her in,\Nit's fine by me. [ Men Laughing ] She's not my type at all.\NI prefer the other one. You know, blonde, sweet-looking. You know, what's-her-name. Has an orgasm every time\Nyou take her out for a cup of coffee. Meg Ryan. No, she's too wholesome.\NThe point about Miss Scott is... she's got that twinkle in her eyes. Probably drug-induced.\NSpends most of her life in bloody rehab. Well, whatever.\NShe's so clearly up for it. You see, most girls, they're all like,\N"Stay away, chum." But Anna,\Nshe is absolutely gagging for it. [ Men Laughing ] Do you know that in over 50%\Nof the languages, the word for "actress" is\Nthe same as the word for "prostitute"? - [ Men Laughing ]\N- Where did you get that from? And Anna is your definitive actress, someone really filthy\Nyou can just flip over and start again. - Right, that's it. Sorry.\N- No, no. There's really no point. [ All Laughing ] Um, sorry--\Nsorry to disturb you guys. - But, um--\N- Can I help? Well, yeah. I wish I hadn't overheard\Nyour conversation, but I did. And, um, I just think, you know, the person you're talking about\Nis a real person. And I think she probably deserves\Na little bit more consideration... rather than having jerks like you\Ndrooling over her. Oh, sod off, mate.\NWhat are you, her dad? [ Snickering, Laughing ] - I'm sorry.\N- No, I love that you tried. Time was I'd have done the same thing.\NIn fact-- [ Laughing Continues ] Hi. Oh, my God. I just wanted to apologize for\Nmy friend. He's very sensitive. Uh, look, I'm sorr-- No, no, leave it. It's, you know--\NI'm sure you didn't mean any harm. I'm sure it was just friendly banter. I'm sure you guys have dicks\Nthe size of peanuts. Enjoy your dinner. The tuna's really good. [ Anna ] I shouldn't have done that.\NI shouldn't have done that. - No, you were brilliant.\N- I'm rash and I'm stupid. What am I doing with you? Uh, I don't know, I'm afraid. I don't either. Here we are. Yes. - Well, look--\N- Do you wanna come up? Well, there seems to be...\Nlots of reasons why I shouldn't, so-- There are lots of reasons. Do you wanna come up? Give me five minutes? - Hi.\N- Hi. To be able to do that\Nis such a wonderful thing. - You've got to go.\N- Why? Because my boyfriend who was in America\Nis, in fact, now in the next room. - Boyfriend?\N- Yes. - Baby, who is it?\N- Uh, it's, uh-- - Uh--\N- Uh, room service. Oh. How you doing? I thought you guys\Nalways wore those, uh, penguin coats. Usually we do. But I was just, uh--\Njust changed to go home. And, um, then I thought\NI'd take this final call. Oh, great. If you don't mind,\NI would like something too. Could you bring me up some\Nreally, really cold water? I'll see what I can do. - Still, not sparkling.\N- Absolutely. Ice-cold still water. Unless it's illegal in the U.K. to serve\Nbeverages below room temperature. I wouldn't want you going to jail\Njust to satisfy my whim, now. - No, I'm sure it's fine.\N- Thank you.\N- I-- Hey, one more thing.\NCould you adios these dirty dishes\Nand take out that trash too? - Uh--\N- Right. No. No. Um, don't-- don't--\Ndon't do that. I don't think\Nit's his job to clear. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.\NWhat's your name, man? Bernie. Oh, listen, Bernie. Thank you.\NI really appreciate it. - Hey, you.\N- [ Nervous Chuckle ] So, tell me. Tell me, tell me.\NGood surprise or nasty surprise? - Good surprise.\N- Oh, you're such a liar. She hates surprises.\NHey, what are you gonna order? - Huh?\N- From him. What are you gonna order? Um, I haven't decided yet. Oh, well, don't overdo it. I don't want people saying,\N"There goes that famous actor\Nwith the big, fat girlfriend." - [ Laughing ]\N- [ Door Closes ] I should leave. This is a fairly strange reality\Nto be faced with. I'm so sorry. I don't know... what to say. Well, I think, um, "good-bye" is traditional. I can think of younger days When living for my life Was everything A man could want to do I could never see Tomorrow I was never told About the sorrow And How can you mend A broken heart How can you stop the rain\Nfrom falling down Tell me how can you stop That old sun from shining What makes the world Go round - And\N- Come on. - How can you mend\N- Open up. This is me.\NSpikey. I'm in contact with some quite\Nimportant spiritual vibrations. Come on.\NHit me with it. - There's this girl--\N- Aha. See, I been gettin' a female vibe.\NGood. Speak on, dear friend. She's someone who... can't be mine, and, uh, it's as if I've taken love heroin,\Nand now I can't ever have it again. I've opened Pandora's box\Nand there's trouble inside. Mmm. Yeah. Tricky. Tricky. I knew a girl at school\Ncalled Pandora. Never got to see her box or--\N[ Chuckling ] Right. - Right. Thanks. That's very helpful.\N- [ Spike Laughing ] You didn't know\Nshe had a boyfriend? No. No. Why? Did you? [ William ] Oh, bloody hell.\NI don't believe it. My whole life ruined because\NI don't read Hello magazine. Let's face facts.\NThis was always a no-win situation. Anna's... a goddess. You know what happens to mortals\Nwho get involved with the gods. - Buggered, is it?\N- Every time. But don't despair. I think I have\Nthe solution to your problems. - Really?\N- Mm-hmm. Her name is Tessa. She works in the Contracts Department. The hair, I admit,\Nis unfashionably frizzy, but she's bright as a button and kisses\Nlike a nymphomaniac on death row. - Apparently.\N- [ Others Laughing ] [ Doorbell Ringing ] Now... try. [ Tessa ]\NI got completely lost. It's very difficult, isn't it?\NEverything's got the word\N"Kensington" in it. Kensington Park Road. Kensington Garden.\NKensington bloody Park Garden. - Tessa, this is Bella, my wife.\N- Hello. - You're in a wheelchair.\N- That's right. And this is William. - Hello, William.\N- Hi. - Max has told me everything about you.\N- Has he? Oh, yes.\NYou are a naughty boy. - Wine?\N- Oh, yes, please. Come on, Willie.\NLet's get sloshed. - Red or white?\N- [ Tessa Chuckling ] Red. Keziah. - Some woodcock?\N- No, thank you. I'm a fruitarian. Ah. What is a fruitarian, exactly? We believe that\Nfruits and vegetables have feelings, so we think cooking is cruel. We only eat things that have actually\Nfallen from the tree or bush, that are, in fact, dead already. Ah. Oh, right. Right. So, um, these carrots? - Have been murdered, yes.\N- Murdered. Poor old carrots.\NThat's-- That's beastly. Delicious coffee. - I'm sorry about the lamb.\N- [ Laughing ] No. I thought it was...\Nreally, you know, interesting. Interesting means inedible. - Really inedible. Yes, you're right.\N- [ Max, Bella Laughing ] Well, maybe we'll meet again. Yeah, yeah.\NThat would be, uh-- be great. Bye. Well? Perfect. Absolutely perfect. And? I think you've forgotten\Nwhat an unusual situation you two have. To find someone you actually... love,\Nwho'll love you. The chances are always minuscule. Look at me. Apart from the American, I've only\Nloved two girls, both total disasters. - That's not fair.\N- One of them marries me,\Nthen leaves me... faster than you can say\N"Indiana Jones." And the other-- who seriously\Nought to have known better-- casually marries my best friend. - She still loves you, though.\N- In a depressingly asexual way. - I never fancied you much, actually.\N- [ Chuckling ] - Oh, God.\N- [ Laughing ] I loved you.\NYou were terribly funny, but... all that kissing my ears. I don't believe it.\NThis is just getting worse. I shall find myself 30 years from now\Nstill sitting on this sofa. - Do you wanna stay?\N- Yeah. Why not? All that awaits me at home\Nis a masturbating Welshman. Here we go. - Good night.\N- Night. [ Chattering, Laughing ] - See you.\N- Right. Guilty.\NVery, very guilty. So it seems. [ Dog Barking ] [ Doorbell Rings ] Hi. Can I come in? Come in. They were taken years ago. I know it was-- But I was poor and--\NIt happens a lot. That's not an excuse.\NI just-- But to make matters worse, it now appears as though... someone was filming me as well. So what was a stupid\Nphoto shoot... now looks like a porn film. The pictures have been sold\Nand they're just... everywhere. I didn't know where to go. The hotel's surrounded. I know it's been months, but-- This is the place. Thank you. I'm just in London... for two days,\Nbut what with your papers, it's the worst place to be.\N[ Sniffling ] These pictures are just so horrible,\Nand they're so grainy. It makes me look like-- Don't think about it. We'll sort it out. What would you like?\NTea? Bath? - A bath would be great.\N- [ Door Slams ] Oh, Christ alive! Brilliant. Fantastic. Magnificent. You must be Spike. [ Exhaling ] - Hi.\N- Just... checkin'. Thank you, God. I'm really sorry about last time. - Oh--\N- He just flew in. - I had no idea.\N- All right. In fact, I had no idea\Nif he was ever gonna fly in again. It's not often one\Nhas the opportunity to adios... the plates of\Na major Hollywood film star. It was, um--\NIt was thrilling for me. So how is he? I don't know. It just got to the point... where I couldn't remember\Nany of the reasons why we were together. And you and love? Oh, well, there's a question, um, without an interesting answer. I have thought about you. - Oh.\N- It's just that... anytime I've tried to keep... anything normal\Nwith a person that was... normal,\Nit's just been a disaster. Listen, I appreciate that.\NAbsolutely. So what is that,\Na film you're doing? Um, start in L.A. on Tuesday. Would you like me to\Ntake you through your lines? Would you?\N'Cause it's all talk, talk, talk. Hand it over. Right.\NUm, basic plot? I'm a difficult but brilliant\Njunior officer... who in about 20 minutes is gonna\Nsave the world from nuclear disaster. Mm-hmm. Okay.\NWell done, you. "Message from Command. Would you\Nlike them to send in the H.K.s?" No. Turn over four T.R.S.s\Nand tell them we need radar feedback... before the K.F.T.s return at 1900. Then inform the Pentagon we'll need\NBlack Star cover from 1000 through 1215. And if you say one word about how many\Nmistakes I made in that speech,\NI'll pelt you with olives. - Very well, Captain.\NI'll pass that on straightaway.\N- Thank you. - How many mistakes did I make?\N- Eleven. - Damn it. And Wainwright--\N- Cartwright. Cartwright, Wainwright,\Nwhatever your name is, I promised little Jimmy\NI'd be home for his birthday, so could you get a message to him\Nthat I may be late. Certainly.\NAnd, uh, little Johnny? - My son's name is Johnny?\N- Yep. - Then get a message to him too.\N- I'll do what I can, Captain, but I can't promise anything. - And Cartwright goes.\N- [ Exhales ] - What do you think?\N- Gripping. It's not Jane Austen. It's not Henry James,\Nbut it's... gripping. - Think I should do Henry James instead?\N- You would be brilliant. But this writer-- writers--\Nthey're pretty damn good too. You never get anyone\Non Wings of the Dove saying, "Inform the Pentagon\Nwe need Black Star cover." For me the book is the poorer for it. I can't believe you have that picture. You like Chagall? I do. It feels like\Nhow love should be-- floating through a dark blue sky. With a goat, playing a violin. Well, yes. Happiness isn't happiness\Nwithout a violin-playing goat. You have big feet. Yes.\NYes, always have had. You know what they say\Nabout men with big feet. No.\NWhat's that? Uh, big feet, large... shoes. The thing that is so irritating... is that now I'm so fierce\Nwhen it comes to nudity clauses. You actually have... clauses\Nin your contract about nudity? Definitely. "You may show the dent of the top of the\Nartist's buttocks, but neither cheek." Or if there's\Na stunt bottom being used... "artist must have full consultation." - You have a stunt bottom?\N- I could have a stunt bottom, yes. Are people tempted to go\Nfor better bottoms than their own? Yeah. [ Chuckling ] I would.\NThis is important stuff. It's one hell of a job, isn't it?\NWhat do you put on your passport? "Profession: Mel Gibson's bottom."\N[ Chuckling ] Actually, Mel does his own ass work. - Right.\N- Why wouldn't he? - Absolutely.\N- It's delicious. What, the ice cream\Nor Mel Gibson's bottom? Both. Equally. But you wouldn't necessarily lick both? - Well, this is tart. [ Laughing ]\N- [ Laughing ] And fuzz-free. And, uh-- Bedroom.\NThere's clean sheets. Today's been a good day, which in the circumstances is... unexpected. Thank you. Anyway, um, time for bed. Or sofa bed. Good night. Good night. [ Clock Ticking ] [ Dog Barking ] [ Stairs Creaking, Footfalls ] Oh, my God. Hello? Hello. - Spike.\N- I wonder if I could have a little word. - Right.\N- I don't want to interfere or anything, but she's just split up\Nfrom her boyfriend, right? - Maybe.\N- And she's in your house. - Yes.\N- And you get on very well. - Yes.\N- Well, isn't this, perhaps, a nice opportunity to... slip her one. Spike, for God's sakes.\NShe's in trouble. Get a grip. You think it's the wrong moment.\NFair enough. - Do you mind if I have a go?\N- Spike! - Okay.\N- I'll talk to you in the morning. Okay.\NMight be too late, but okay. [ Footfalls ] [ Footfalls End ] [ Footfalls Resume ] [ Groans ]\NPlease, sod off. - Okay. All right.\N- No. No, no! Wait! I thought you were,\Num, someone else. I thought you were Spike.\NI'm thrilled that you're not. [ Whispers ]\NWow. What? Nothing. It does strike me as, well, surreal that I'm allowed\Nto see you naked. - You and every person in this country.\N- I'm sorry. What is it about men and nudity, huh? Particularly breasts. - How can you be so interested in them?\N- Well-- But, seriously,\Nthey're just breasts. Every second person\Nin the world has them. More than that, when you think about it.\NMeat Loaf has a very nice pair. [ Chuckling ]\NBut they're odd-looking. They're for milk.\NYour mother has them. You've seen a thousand of them.\NWhat's all the fuss about? Actually, I can't think\Nwhat it is, really. Let me just have a quick look. - Nope, nope. Beats me.\N- [ Laughing ] Rita Hayworth used to say, "They go to bed with Gilda,\Nthey wake up with me." - Who was Gilda?\N- Her most famous part. Men went to bed with the dream, and they didn't like it\Nwhen they woke up with the reality. Do you feel that way? You are lovelier this morning\Nthan you have ever been. I'll be right back. Breakfast in bed. - Oh.\N- Or it's brunch or lunch or something. My God. Can I stay a bit longer? Stay forever. Okay.\NOh. Forgot the jam. [ Doorbell Rings ] I'll get the jam,\Nyou get the door. [ Flashbulbs Popping,\NReporters Clamoring ] Jesus Christ. What? What is it? - Nothing, really.\N- You're up to something. - Anna, no, please!\N- [ Clamoring ] My God. And they got a picture of you\Ndressed like that. Yes. Undressed like this, yeah. - Morning, darling ones.\N- It's me. The press are here. No, there are hundreds of them. My brilliant plan\Nwas not so brilliant. I know. I know. I know.\NJust get over here. Damn it. - Um, I wouldn't go outside.\N- Why not? - Just take my word for it.\N- Oh. [ Clamoring ] How did I look?\NNot bad. Not at all bad.\NWell-chosen briefs, I'd say. Chicks love gray. Nice firm buttocks. How are you doing? How do you think I'm doing? - I don't know what happened.\N- I do. Your furry friend thought he'd make\Na buck telling the papers where I was. - That's not true.\N- Really? The entire British press\Ngot up this morning and thought,\N"I know where Anna Scott is. She's in that house with the blue door\Nin Notting Hill." Then you go out\Nin your goddamn underwear! - I went out in my goddamn underwear too.\N- Get out! Sorry. - I'm so sorry.\N- This is such an unbelievable mess. I come to you to protect myself\Nagainst more crappy gossip, and now I've landed in it\Nall over again. For God's sake, I've got a boyfriend! - You have?\N- As far as they're concerned I do. And now, tomorrow there'll be\Npictures of you in every newspaper\Nfrom here to Timbuktu! I know that, but...\Njust let's stay calm. You stay calm! This is a perfect\Nsituation for you, isn't it? Minimum input, maximum publicity. Everywhere you go, people will say,\N"Well done, you. You slept with that actress.\NWe saw the pictures." - That is spectacularly unfair.\N- That's yours. Maybe it'll even help business. Buy a boring book about Egypt\Nfrom the guy that screwed Anna Scott. Stop! Stop! I beg you! Calm down.\NHow about a cup of tea? I don't want\Na goddamn cup of tea. - I just wanna go home.\N- [ Doorbell Rings ] Spike, see who that is,\Nand put some clothes on, for God's sake. - [ Clamoring ]\N- Looks like a chauffeur to me. Spike owes you\Nan expensive dinner or holiday, depending who's got the brains\Nto get the going rate on betrayal. That is not true.\NWait a minute. This is crazy behavior. Can't we just\Nlaugh about all this? Seriously. In the huge sweep of things,\Nthis stuff doesn't matter. What he's gonna say next is\Nthere's people starving in the Sudan. Well, there are, and we don't\Nhave to go anywhere near that far. My best friend slipped down stairs,\Ncracked her back... and she's in a wheelchair\Nfor the rest of her life. All I'm asking for is\Na normal amount of perspective. You're right.\NOf course, you're right. It's just that I've dealt\Nwith this garbage for ten years. You've had it for ten minutes. Our perspectives are very different. Today's newspapers will be lining\Ntomorrow's wastepaper bin. - Excuse me?\N- You know. It's just one day. Tomorrow, today's papers\Nwill all have been thrown out. You really don't get it. This story will be filed. Every time anyone writes anything\Nabout me, they'll dig up these photos. Newspapers last forever. I'll regret this forever. Right. Right. I will feel the opposite, if that's okay by you, and, uh, always be glad that you...\Ncame to stay. But, um, you're probably right. You better go. [ Doorbell Rings ] [ Clamoring ] Was it you? I may have told a few people\Ndown at the pub. Right. Ain't no sunshine when she's gone It's not warm when she's away Ain't no sunshine when she's gone And she's always gone too long Any time she goes away Ain't no sunshine when she's gone It's not warm when she's away Ain't no sunshine when she's gone And she's always gone too long Any time she goes away Wonder this time where she's gone Wonder if she's gone to stay Ain't no sunshine when she's gone And this house just ain't no home Any time she goes away Ain't no sunshine when she's gone And this house just ain't no home Any time she goes away Any time she goes away Any time she goes away Any time she goes away Have I got something for you. Something\Nwhich will make you love me so much, Have I got something for you. Something\Nwhich will make you love me so much, you will want to hug me every day\Nfor the rest of my life. - Blimey. What is it?\N- [ Sighing ] Phone number of Anna Scott's agent\Nin London... and her agent in New York. Listen, you think about her all\Nthe time. Now you can ring her. Yeah. Brilliant. Thanks. I'll see you tonight.\NHey, Marty. Ooh! Sexy cardi. [ Tapping On Glass ] Shh! Hello!\NI have a little speech to make. I won't stand up because\NI can't... be bothered. Exactly a year ago today, this man here\Nstarted the finest restaurant in London. - Hear, hear.\N- Thank you very much. Unfortunately,\Nno one ever came to eat here. - It's a tiny hiccup.\N- [ Laughing ] And so we have to face the fact\Nthat from next week, we must find somewhere new to eat. I just want to say to Tony...\Ndon't take it personally. The more I think about things, the more\NI see no rhyme or reason in life. No one knows why some things work out\Nand some things don't. Why some of us get lucky... - and some of us--\N- Get fired. - What?\N- No! Yeah, well, it seems\Nthey're shifting the whole outfit... much more towards\Nthe emerging markets. And, of course, well,\NI was total crap, so-- A toast to Bernie-- the worst\Nstockbroker in the whole world. I thank you.\NAnd Tony, the worst restauranteur. - Tony and Bernie. Both crap...\N- The terrible two. in their own special ways. [ Chattering ] Since it's an evening\Nof announcements, uh, I've also got one. Um, I've decided to get engaged. I've found myself a nice,\Nslightly odd-looking bloke... who I know is gonna make me happy\Nfor the rest of my life. Wait a sec. I mean, I-- I'm your brother. I don't know\Nanything about this. Is he-- - Is he financially viable?\N- [ Chuckling ] He's an artist...\Nwith brilliant prospects. - This is a secret\Nyou've been keeping from me.\N- [ Bella ] No, I swear! [ Whispering ]\NBy the way, it's you. - Me?\N- What do you think? Well, yeah. Groovy. Excuse me.\NAre there any more announcements? Well, actually, yes. I feel I should\Napologize to everyone... for my behavior\Nover the last six months. I have, as you know,\Nbeen somewhat down in the mouth. There's an understatement.\NThere are dead people on better form. But I just wish to make it clear\Nthat I've turned a corner, and, um, henceforward intend\Nto be impressively happy. [ Piano ] Without a love of my own - Blue moon\N- Ba-boom, ba-boom You knew just what I was there for Oh, God. I'm horribly drunk. You heard me saying a prayer for - Come here.\N- Ba-boom, ba-boom Someone I really could care for - So you've laid the ghost?\N- Wah, wah, wah, wah I believe I have. Don't give a damn\Nabout the famous girl? No. No, I don't think I do. Which means you won't be distracted\Nby the fact that she's back in London... grasping her Oscar... and currently to be found filming,\Nmost days, on Hampstead Heath. Oh, God, no. So not over her, in fact. [ Laughter ] - Can I help you?\N- Yeah, I'm, um-- - I'm looking for Anna Scott.\N- Does she know you're coming? No. No, uh, she doesn't. - I'm afraid I can't let you through.\N- Right. I mean, I am actually a friend.\NI'm not a lunatic, but-- - No, you basically, er--\N- Can't let you through, sir. Well, this is, uh-- I only found out\Nyou were here yesterday. - I was going to call, but I--\N- [ Woman ] Uh, Anna. Yes. Um-- Things aren't going very well,\Nand it's our last day. Absolutely, yeah.\NYou're clearly very busy. But if-- if you could wait, there are... things to say. Okay. Drink tea.\NThere's lots of tea. Come and have a look. Are you a fan of Henry James? - This is a Henry James film?\N- Yeah. This is, uh, Harry. He'll give you a pair of headphones\Nso you can hear the dialogue. - Thank you very much.\N- No problem. - Hi.\N- Hi. Here we go. - Volume's on the side. Have a seat.\N- Thank you. [ Man Through Headphones ]\NWe are living in cloud cuckoo land.\NWe'll never get this done today. [ Anna ] We've got to.\NI have to be in New York on Thursday. Oh, stop showing off.\NGod, that's an enormous ass. - I'm not listening.\N- But seriously, it's not fair. So many tragic young teenagers\Nwith anorexia... and that girl has an ass\Nshe could perfectly well share around... with at least ten other women\Nand still be big-bottomed. I would think, looking at\Nsomething nice like that, you and your...\Nbony little excuse for an arse... would be well advised to keep quiet. Now down to business.\NThe end of the scene. Now down to business.\NThe end of the scene. Um, I ask you when you're\Ntelling everyone, and you say-- Um, tomorrow will be soon enough. And then I-- Right. Okay. Say, who was that rather diffident chap\NI saw you talking to round the back? No one. Just some guy from the past. I-- It's a bit of an awkward situation.\NI don't know what he's doing here. 'Course. Thanks. I've got to, um-- Any time. [ Man ] Ladies and gentlemen,\Ncan we have you on your first marks? On your first marks! Uh, I-I do hate to disturb you\Nwhilst you're cooking the books, but, uh, there's a delivery for you. Martin, really.\NCan't you just do it yourself? But you see, this is not for the shop.\NThis is for you. Right. Okay. Tell me, if I employ a wet rag, would I\Nhave to pay it as much as I pay you? Hi. Hello. You disappeared. Yeah. Yeah. Um-- I had to leave.\NI didn't want to disturb. - How have you been?\N- Fine, fine. Everything much the same. When they change the law,\NSpike and I will marry immediately. Whereas you, I've watched in wonder. - Awards, glory.\N- Oh, no. It's-- It's all nonsense, believe me. I'd no idea how much nonsense\Nit was, but... nonsense it all is. Well, um-- Yesterday was our last day of filming,\Nso... I'm leaving. But, um-- I brought this for you from home, so I thought I'd give it to you. Thank you. Shall I-- Oh, no, don't open it now.\NI'll be embarrassed. Well, thank you. I don't know\Nwhat it's for, but thanks anyway. Actually, I had it in my apartment,\Nand I thought you'd-- But when it came to it,\NI didn't know how to call, having behaved so badly. Twice. So it's just been\Nsitting in the hotel. Then you came and... I figured-- The thing is-- The thing is-- What? What is the thing? Don't even think about it.\NGo away immediately. - Go away.\N- Right. Sorry. You were saying? Yes. I have to go away today, but I... wondered if I didn't... whether you might\Nlet me see you a little, or... a lot, maybe. See if you could like me again. But yesterday\Nthat actor asked you who I was, and you just\Ndismissed me out of hand. I heard. You had a microphone.\NI had headphones. You expect me\Nto tell the truth about my life... to the most indiscreet man\Nin England? Uh, excuse me. It's your mother on the phone. Will you tell her\NI'll ring her back? I've actually tried that tack, but\Nshe said you've said that once before, and it's now been about 24 hours... and the foot that was purple\Nis now sort of blackish in color and-- Right, right. Yeah.\NPerfect timing, as ever. Martin, hold the fort a second. Uh, yes. All right. Um, could I just say-- [ Chuckles ] I thought Ghost\Nwas the most wonderful film. - Is that right?\N- Oh, yes. [ Chuckles ] Um, I've always wondered... what Patrick Swayze's like\Nin-- in-- in real life. I can't say that I know Patrick\Nall that well. He wasn't that friendly during filming? Well, I'm sure he was friendly to\NDemi Moore who acted with him in Ghost. Oh. Oh, right. Sorry.\N[ Nervous Chuckle ] Always been a bit of an ass.\N[ Chuckling ] Um, anyway-- Um-- Well, it was lovely to meet you. I'm a huge, huge fan of yours. And Demi's, of course. Sorry. That's fine. There's always a pause when the jury\Ngoes out to consider their verdict. Anna, look, um-- I'm a fairly levelheaded bloke, not often in and out of love. But, uh-- Can I just say no to your... kind request and, uh, leave it at that? Yes. Fine. Of course. I-- Of course. I'll just be going, then.\NIt was nice to see you. The thing is, with you I'm in real... danger. It seems like a... perfect situation, apart from that\Nfoul temper of yours, but... my relatively inexperienced heart\Nwould, I fear, not... recover, uh, if I was... once again cast aside,\Nas I would absolutely expect to be. There are just too many pictures of you,\Ntoo many films. You'd go and I'd be, uh, well, buggered, basically. That really is a real no, isn't it? I live in Notting Hill.\NYou live in... Beverly Hills. Everyone in the world\Nknows who you are. My mother has trouble\Nremembering my name. Fine. Fine. Good decision.\NGood decision. The fame thing isn't really real,\Nyou know? And don't forget I'm-- I'm also just a girl... standing in front of a boy... asking him to love her. Good-bye. So what do you think?\NGood move? [ Honey ]\NYeah, good move. I mean, when all's said and done,\Nshe's nothing special. I saw her taking her trousers down, and I definitely glimpsed\Nsome cellulite down there. Good decision, yeah. All actresses are as mad as snakes. - Tones, what do you reckon?\N- Never met her, never want to. - Brilliant. Max?\N- Absolutely. Never trust a vegetarian. Great. Thanks. Brilliant. [ Panting ]\NI was called and I came. What's up? William's just turned down Anna Scott. You daft prick. No, no.\NNo, no, it's actually quite sensible. That painting\Nisn't the original, is it? Um, you know,\NI think it might be, yeah. But she said\Nshe wanted to go out with you. - Yeah.\N- Well, that's nice. What? Well, you know, anyone saying they wanna go out with you\Nis pretty great, isn't it? It was... sort of... sweet, actually. Um, I mean,\NI know she's an actress and all that... so she can... deliver a line, but, um, she said she might be\Nas famous as she can be, but also that she was... just a girl... standing in front of a boy... asking him... to love her. Oh, sod a dog. I've made\Nthe wrong decision, haven't I? Yeah. Max, how fast is your car? - Hey\N- [ Horn Honks ] - Good luck!\N- If anyone gets in our way,\Nwe have small nuclear devices. - Where to?\N- All I can think is The Ritz. - Where's Bella?\N- She's not coming. - Oh, sod that. Bernie, in the back.\N- What? [ Chattering ] - So glad we made it\N- Max, I'm okay. - So glad you made it\N- Come on, babe. You gotta gimme some lovin' Gimme, gimme some lovin' - Gimme some lovin'\N- Gimme, gimme some lovin' - Gimme some lovin'\N- [ Bella ] Which way are you going? Down Kensington Church Street, then\NKnightsbridge, then Hyde Park Corner. - No, crazy. Go along Bayswater.\N- That's right. Then Park Lane. No, straight down to the Cromwell Road,\Nthen left. - No!\N- [ All Arguing ] Stop right there!\NI will decide the route. All right? Sorry, Max. James Bond never has to put up\Nwith this sort of shit. Well, I feel so good\NEverything is soundin' hot You better take it easy\N'cause the place is on fire - [ Continues ]\N- [ Bella ] Turn right! - I can't. It's one way.\N- Do a U-turn. - Oh, sod it. Hold on.\N- [ Horns Honking ] So glad we made it So glad we made it - Brilliant!\N- [ Laughing ] - Gimme, gimme some lovin'\N- Gimme some lovin' Gimme, gimme some lovin' - Gimme some lovin' every day\N- Bloody hell, this is fun! - Hey\N- Sorry. - Hey\N- Sorry. Hi.\NIs Miss Scott staying here? - No, sir.\N- How 'bout Miss Flintstone? - No, sir.\N- Uh, Bambi? - No, sir.\N- Or, um-- I don't know.\NBeavis or Butt-head? No, sir. Thanks. Thanks. There was a Miss Pocahontas, but she checked out\Nabout an hour ago. I believe she's holding\Na press conference at the Savoy... before flying to America. We have liftoff. [ Speaks Japanese ] You have message for Takiama? I'll just check, sir. [ Resumes ] - Gimme some lovin'\N- Gimme, gimme some lovin' Gimme some lovin' every day Bugger this for a bunch of bananas. Stop! Stop! Stop!\NStay there! Go! Go! - Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hang on!\N- [ Horns Honking ] Come on! No! Wait! Wait there! Come on! Come on! Wait! Whoa, whoa, whoa! Go on!\NThrough, through! You're my hero! Whoa! Down boy. Everybody should and I'm So glad we made it Hey, hey\NSo glad we made it You gotta gimme some lovin' - Gimme, gimme some lovin'\N- Gimme some lovin' - Gimme, gimme some lovin'\N- Gimme some lovin' Gimme, gimme some lovin' - Gimme, gimme some lovin'\N- Excuse me. - Yes?\N- Where's the press conference, please? - Are you an accredited\Nmember of the press?\N- Yep. - There you go.\N- That's a Blockbuster Video\Nmembership card, sir. That's right.\NI work for their in-house magazine. - Movies Are Our Business.\N- I'm sorry, sir. - He's with me.\N- And you are? Writing an article on how London hotels\Ntreat people in wheelchairs. Yes, of course, madam.\NIt's in the Lancaster Room. Though I'm afraid you're rather late. Run! [ Chattering ] [ Man ] Does this mean that Miss Scott\Nwill not be publicizing her next film? No, it absolutely\Ndoes not mean that. She'll be abiding by\Nall her present commitments. She just won't be making\Nany more for the next year. [ Man #2 ]\NWhen will the film be released? [ Publicist ] At the moment,\Nthe plan is to release in America... towards the end of the autumn, and over here around Christmas\Nor early in the new year. and over here around Christmas\Nor early in the new year. Right! Dominic. Anna, how much longer are you\Nstaying in the U.K., then? No time at all.\NI leave tonight. Which is why we have to round things\Nup now, so final questions, please. Yes. Lady there. Is your decision to take\Na year off anything to do... with the rumors about Jeff\Nand his present leading lady? - Absolutely not.\N- Do you believe the rumors? Well, it's really\Nnot my business anymore. Though I will say, from my experience,\Nrumors about Jeff do tend to be true. [ Laughter ] Yeah. The last time you were here, there\Nwere some fairly graphic photographs... taken of you\Nwith a young English guy. So, uh, what happened there? He was just a friend.\NWe're still friends, I think. - [ Reporters Clamoring ]\N- Right, um-- Yes. Gentleman in the pink shirt. Yes. Miss Scott, are there any circumstances in which... the two of you... might be more than just good friends? I hoped there would be, but no,\NI'm... assured there aren't. - But what would you say if--\N- Sorry. Just the one question, please. No, it's all right.\NYou were saying. I was just wondering if, uh, it turned out that this person, uh-- [ Man #3 ]\NThacker. His name was Thacker. - Thanks, thanks.\N- [ Laughter ] I just wondered whether if... Mr.Thacker realized he'd been\Na daft prick... [ Reporters Chattering ] and got down on his knees and...\Nbegged you to reconsider, whether you would, in fact, then... reconsider? - Yes, I believe I would.\N- [ Reporters Chattering ] That's very good news.\NUm-- The readers of Horse & Hound\Nwill be absolutely delighted. [ Laughter ] Right. Uh, Dominic, if you'd\Nlike to ask your question again? Yeah? Anna, how long are you\Nintending to stay here in Britain? Indefinitely. She may be the face I can't forget The trace of pleasure or regret May be my treasure\Nor the price I have to pay - She may be the song that\N- What happened? - Summer sings\N- It was good. May be the chill the autumn brings May be a hundred different things Within the measure of a day She may be the beauty or the beast May be the famine or the feast May turn each day\Ninto a heaven or a hell She may be the mirror of my dream The smile reflected in a stream She may not be what she may seems Inside her shell [ Crowd Cheering, Shouting ] She who always seems\Nso happy in a crowd Whose eyes can be\Nso private and so proud No one's allowed to see them When they cry She may be the love\Nthat cannot hope to last May come to me\Nfrom shadows of the past That I remember till the day I die She may be the reason I survive The why and wherefore I'm alive The one I'll care for\Nthrough the rough And ready years Me, I'll take her laughter\Nand her tears And make them all my souvenirs For where she goes I've got to be The meaning of my life is She She Oh, she It's in the way you are You've got a way with me Somehow you got me to believe In everything that I could be I gotta say You really got a way It's in the way you want me It's in the way you hold me The way you show me\Njust what love's Made of It's in the way we make love Oh, how I adore you Like no one before you I love you just the way you are It's in the way you want me Oh, it's in the way you hold me The way you show me\Njust what love's Made of It's in the way we make love It's just the way you are No matter what they tell us No matter what they do No matter what they teach us What we believe is true I can't deny what I believe I can't be what I'm not - I know our love\N- I know our love's forever - I know\N- I know no matter what No matter who they follow No matter where they've been No matter how they judge us I'll be everyone you need - I can't deny what I believe\N- What I believe I can't be what I'm not I know I'm not I know this love's forever That's all that matters now\Nno matter what - No, no matter what\N- No, no matter - That's all that matters to me\N- No, no matter what No, no matter - That's all that matters to me\N- No, no matter what No, no matter what - That's all that matters to me\N- No, no matter what No, no matter what - That's all that matters to me\N- No, no matter what No, no matter what That's all that matters to me
