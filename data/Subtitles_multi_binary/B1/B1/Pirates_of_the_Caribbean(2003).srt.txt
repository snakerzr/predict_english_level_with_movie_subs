Cursed pirates sail these waters. You don't wanna bring them\Ndown on us, do you? Mr. Gibbs, that will do. She was singing about pirates. Bad luck to be singing about pirates\Nwith us mired in this unnatural fog, - mark my words.\N- Consider them marked. - On your way.\N- Aye, lieutenant. It's bad luck to have a woman\Non board too. Even a miniature one. I think it would be rather exciting\Nto meet a pirate. Think again, Miss Swann. Vile and dissolute creatures,\Nthe lot of them. I intend to see to it that any man\Nwho sails under a pirate flag or wears a pirate brand\Ngets what he deserves: A short drop and a sudden stop. Lieutenant Norrington,\NI appreciate your fervour, but I'm concerned about the effect\Nthis subject will have upon my daughter. My apologies, Governor Swann. - Actually, I find it all fascinating.\N- Yes, that's what concerns me. Look, a boy. There's a boy in the water. Man overboard! Man the ropes. Fetch a hook. Haul him aboard. - He's still breathing.\N- Mary, Mother of God. What happened here? It was most likely the powder magazine.\NMerchant vessels run heavily armed. A lot of good it did them. Everyone's thinking it. I'm just saying it. Pirates. There's no proof of that.\NIt was probably an accident. - Rouse the captain immediately.\N- Aye, sir. Heave to and take in sail.\NLaunch the boats. Heave to. Elizabeth,\NI want you to accompany the boy. He'll be in your charge.\NTake care of him. It's okay. My name's Elizabeth Swann. Will Turner. I'm watching over you, Will. You're a pirate. Has he said anything? His name's William Turner.\NThat's all I found out. Take him below. Elizabeth? Are you all right? - Are you decent?\N- Yes. Yes. You still abed at this hour? It's a beautiful day. I have a gift for you. - Oh, it's beautiful.\N- Isn't it? May I enquire as to the occasion? Does a father need an occasion\Nto dote upon his daughter? Go on. Actually, I-- I had hoped you might wear it\Nfor the ceremony today. The ceremony? Captain Norrington's\Npromotion ceremony. I knew it. Commodore Norrington,\Nas he's about to become. A fine gentleman, don't you think?\NHe fancies you, you know. Elizabeth? How's it coming'? It's difficult to say. I'm told it's the latest fashion in London. Well, women in London\Nmust have learned not to breathe. My lord, you have a visitor. - Mr. Turner, good to see you again.\N- Good day, sir. I have your order. The blade is folded steel. That's gold filigree laid into the handle. If I may? Perfectly balanced. The tang\Nis nearly the full width of the blade. Impressive. Very impressive.\NWell, now. Commodore Norrington's\Ngoing to be very pleased with this. Do pass my compliments\Non to your master. I Shall. A craftsman is always pleased\Nto hear his work is appreciated. Elizabeth, you look absolutely stunning. Will. It's so good to see you. - I had a dream about you last night.\N- About me? Elizabeth, is that entirely proper\Nfor you to--? About the day we met.\NDo you remember? How could I forget, Miss Swann? Will, how many times must I ask you\Nto call me Elizabeth? At least once more, Miss Swann,\Nas always. There, you see?\NAt least the boy has a sense of propriety. Now, we really must be going.\NThere you are. Good day, Mr. Turner. Come along. Good day... Elizabeth. What--? Hold up there, you. It's a shilling to tie up your boat\Nat the dock. And I shall need to know your name. What do you say to 3 shillings\Nand we forget the name? Welcome to Port Royal, Mr. Smith. Two paces, march! Right about face! Present arms! - This dock is off-limits to civilians.\N- I'm terribly sorry, I didn't know. If I see one,\NI shall inform you immediately. Apparently, there's some sort of\Nhigh-toned and fancy to do up at the fort. How could it be two upstanding gentlemen\Nsuch as yourselves did not merit an invitation? Someone has to make sure this dock\Nstays off-limits to civilians. It's a fine goal, to be sure,\Nbut it seems to me a ship like that makes this one here a bit superfluous,\Nreally. Oh, the Dauntless is the power\Nin these waters, true enough. But there's no ship that can match\Nthe Interceptor for speed. I've heard of one. Supposed to be\Nvery fast, nigh uncatchable. The Black Pearl. Well, there's no real ship\Nthat could match the Interceptor. - Black Pearl is a real ship.\N- No. No, it's not. Yes, it is. I've seen it. - You've seen it?\N- Yes. - You haven't seen it.\N- Yes, I have. You've seen a ship with black sails that's crewed by the damned\Nand captained by a man so evil that hell itself spat him back out? - No.\N- No. But I have seen a ship with black sails. Oh, and no ship that's not crewed\Nby the damned and captained by a man so evil\Nthat hell itself spat him out could possibly have black sails. Therefore it couldn't possibly be\Nany other ship than the Black Pearl. Is that what you're saying? No. Like I said, there's no real ship\Nthat could match the Interceptor. Hey! You! Get away from there. You don't have permission\Nto be aboard there, mate. I'm sorry. It's just--\NIt's such a pretty boat. Ship. What's your name? Smith. Or Smitty, if you like. What's your purpose in Port Royal,\NMr. Smith? - And no lies.\N- Why, then I confess. It is my intention to commandeer one\Nof these ships, pick up a crew in Tortuga, raid, pillage, plunder and otherwise pilfer\Nmy weasely black guts out. - I said no lies.\N- I think he's telling the truth. If he were telling the truth,\Nhe wouldn't have told us. Unless, of course, he knew you wouldn't\Nbelieve the truth, even if he told it to you. May I have a moment? You look lovely, Elizabeth. I apologise if I seem forward,\Nbut I must speak my mind. This promotion throws into sharp relief\Nthat which I have not yet achieved. A marriage to a fine woman. You have become a fine woman,\NElizabeth. - I can't breathe.\N- Yes, I'm a bit nervous myself. And then they made me their chief. Elizabeth? Elizabeth! - The rocks.\N- Sir, it's a miracle she missed them. - Will you be saving her then?\N- I can't swim. Pride of the King's Navy, you are.\NDo not lose these. What was that? Make way. I got her. - She's not breathing.\N- Move. I never would have thought of that. Clearly,\Nyou've never been to Singapore. Where did you get that? On your feet. Elizabeth. - Are you all right?\N- Yes. Yes, I'm fine. - Shoot him.\N- Father. - What?\N- Commodore, do you really intend\Nto kill my rescuer? I believe thanks are in order. Had a brush with the East India\NTrading Company, did we, pirate? Hang him. Keep your guns on him, men.\NGillette, fetch some irons. - Well, well, Jack Sparrow, isn't it?\N- Captain Jack Sparrow, if you please. - Well, I don't see your ship, captain.\N- I'm in the market, as it were. He said he came to commandeer one. I told you he was telling the truth.\NThese are his, sir. No additional shots nor powder. A compass that doesn't point north. And I half-expected it\Nto be made of wood. You are, without doubt,\Nthe worst pirate I've ever heard of. But you have heard of me. Commodore, I really must protest. Carefully, lieutenant. Pirate or not, this man saved my life. One good deed is not enough to redeem\Na man of a lifetime of wickedness. Though it seems enough\Nto condemn him. Indeed. Finally. - No. No, don't shoot.\N- I knew you'd warm up to me. Commodore Norrington,\Nmy effects, please. And my hat. Commodore. - Elizabeth. It is Elizabeth, isn't it'?\N- It's Miss Swann. Miss Swann, if you'd be so kind? Come, come, dear.\NWe don't have all day. Now, if you'll be very kind. Easy on the goods, darling. You're despicable. Sticks and stones, love. I saved your life, you save mine,\Nwe're square. Gentlemen, my lady, you will always remember this\Nas the day that you almost caught\NCaptain Jack Sparrow. - Now will you shoot him?\N- Open fire! On his heels. - Take steady aim.\N- Fire! Fire! - Fire.\N- Take care of him. Fire! Gillette, Mr. Sparrow\Nhas a dawn appointment with the gallows. I would hate for him to miss it. Search upstairs. Look lively, men. Right where I left you. Not where I left you. You're the one they're hunting. The pirate. You seem somewhat familiar.\NHave I threatened you before? I make a point of avoiding familiarity\Nwith pirates. Well, it would be a shame\Nto put a black mark on your record. So if you'll excuse me? Do you think this wise, boy?\NCrossing blades with a pirate? You threatened Miss Swann. Only a little. You know what you're doing,\NI'll give you that. Excellent form. But how's your footwork? If I step here-- Very good. And now I step again. Ta. That is a wonderful trick. Except once again, you are between me\Nand my way out. And now you have no weapon. Who makes all these? I do. And I practise with them\Nthree hours a day. You need to find yourself a girl, mate. Or perhaps the reason you practise\Nthree hours a day is that you already found one and are otherwise incapable\Nof wooing said strumpet. You're not a eunuch, are you? I practise three hours a day so that\Nwhen I meet a pirate, I can kill him. You cheated. Pirate. - Move away.\N- No. - Please move?\N- No. I cannot just step aside\Nand let you escape. This shot is not meant for you. Come on. There he is. Over here. Excellent work, Mr. Brown. You've assisted in the capture\Nof a dangerous fugitive. Just doing my civic duty, sir. Well, I trust that you will always remember\Nthis as the day that Captain Jack Sparrow\Nalmost escaped. Take him away. - Hey, come on.\N- Can you smell it, boy? - Smell the bone.\N- Come here, boy. - Come on.\N- You want a nice, juicy bone? - Come here, boy.\N- Come on. - Come here, boy.\N- You can keep doing that forever, the dog is never going to move. Oh, excuse us if we haven't resigned\Nourselves to the gallows just yet. There you go, miss.\NIt was a difficult day for you, I'm sure. I suspected Commodore Norrington\Nwould propose but I must admit,\NI wasn't entirely prepared for it. Well, I meant your being threatened\Nby that pirate. It sounds terrifying. Yes, it was terrifying. But the commodore proposed.\NFancy that. Now, that's a smart match, miss,\Nif it's not too bold to say. It is a smart match. He's a fine man. The sort any woman should dream\Nof marrying. Well, that Will Turner,\Nhe's a fine man too. That is too bold. Oh, begging your pardon, miss.\NIt was not my place. Has my daughter given you\Nan answer yet? No, she hasn't. Well, she has had a very trying day. - Ghastly weather, don't you think?\N- Bleak. Very bleak. What's that? Cannon fire! Return fire. - I know those guns.\N- Men to arms. It's the Pearl. The Black Pearl? I've heard stories. She's been preying on ships\Nand settlements for near ten years. - Never leaves any survivors.\N- No survivors? Then where do the stories come from,\NI wonder? Clear the dock! Mama! Mind your oars. Come on, you. I need that to see. Come back. - Sight the muzzle flash.\N- Aim for the flashes. I need a full spread, fore and aft.\NMr. Stevens, more cartridges. Governor.\NBarricade yourself in my office. - Good God.\N- That's an order. Don't! Hello, chum. Up there. Miss Swann,\Nthey've come to kidnap you. - What?\N- You're the governor's daughter. Come on, in here. Listen, they haven't seen you. Go hide and the first chance you can,\Nrun to the fort. - No!\N- Gotcha. Had enough? No, no. It's hot. - I'm burning.\N- Come on. Come on, you mates. We know you're here, poppet. - Poppet.\N- Come out. And we promise we won't hurt you. We will find you, poppet. You've got something of ours\Nand it calls to us. The gold calls to us. The gold, the gold. Hello, poppet. Parley! - What?\N- Parley. I invoke the right of parley. According to the Code of the Brethren,\Nset down by Morgan and Bartholomew, - you have to take me to your captain.\N- I know the code. If an adversary demands parley, you can do then no harm\Nuntil the parley is complete. - To blazes with the code.\N- She wants to be taken to the captain. And she'll go without a fuss. We must honour the code. Say goodbye. Goodbye. - Come on.\N- Elizabeth. Hello. Out of my way, scum. My sympathies, friend.\NYou've no matter of luck at all. Come on, doggie. It's just you and me now.\NIt's you and old Jack. Come on. Come on, that's it, boy. Good boy. Come and get the bone. That's a good boy. Come on. A bit closer. A bit closer.\NThat's it. That's it, doggie. Come on, you filthy, slimy, mangy cur. Oh, no. Don't do that.\NNo, no, no, I didn't mean it. I didn't-- Gotcha. This ain't the armoury. Well, well, well.\NLook what we have here, Twigg. Captain Jack Sparrow. Last time I saw you, you were all alone\Non a godforsaken island shrinking into the distance. His fortunes aren't improved much. Worry about your own fortunes,\Ngentlemen. The deepest circle of hell\Nis reserved for betrayers and mutineers. So there is a curse. - That's interesting.\N- You know nothing of hell. That's very interesting. No! I didn't know we was taking on captives. She's invoked the right of parley\Nwith Captain Barbossa. - I'm here to negotiate--\N- You will speak when spoken to. And ye'll not lay a hand\Non those under the protection of parley. Aye, sir. My apologies, miss. Captain Barbossa, I am here to negotiate the cessation\Nof hostilities against Port Royal. There were a lot of long words\Nin there, miss. We're nought but humble pirates.\NWhat is it that you want? I want you to leave\Nand never come back. I'm disinclined to acquiesce\Nto your request. Means no. Very well. I'll drop it. Me holds are bursting with swag.\NThat bit of shine matters to us? Why? It's what you've been searching for. I recognise this ship. I saw it eight years\Nago on the crossing from England. Did you, now? Fine. Well, I suppose if it is worthless,\Nthen there's no point in me keeping it. No. You have a name, Missy? Elizabeth Turner. I'm a maid in the governor's household. Miss Turner. - Turner?\N- Bootstrap. And how does a maid come to own\Na trinket such as that? Family heirloom perhaps? I didn't steal it if that's what you mean. Very well. You hand it over\Nand we'll put your town to our rudder and ne'er return. Our bargain? Still the guns and stow them.\NSignal the men. Set the flags. - Make good to clear port.\N- Wait. You have to take me to shore. - According to the Code of the Order--\N- First, your return to shore was not part\Nof our negotiations nor our agreement, so I must do nothing. And secondly, you must be a pirate for\Nthe Pirates' Code to apply, and you're not. And thirdly, the Code is more what\Nyou'd call guidelines than actual rules. Welcome aboard the Black Pearl,\NMiss Turner. They've taken her.\NThey've taken Elizabeth. Mr. Murtogg, remove this man. We have to hunt them down.\NWe must save her. And where do you propose we start? If you have any information\Nconcerning my daughter, please share it. That Jack Sparrow, - he talked about the Black Pearl.\N- Mentioned it is more what he did. Ask him where it is. Make a deal with him.\NHe could lead us to it. No. The pirates who invaded this fort\Nleft Sparrow locked in his cell. Ergo, they are not his allies. Governor, we will establish\Ntheir most likely course and launch-- That's not good enough! Mr. Turner, you are not a military man.\NYou are not a sailor. You are a blacksmith. And this is not the moment\Nfor rash actions. Do not make the mistake of thinking you are the only man here\Nwho cares for Elizabeth. Please, please. - You, Sparrow.\N- Aye? You're familiar with that ship,\Nthe Black Pearl? - I've heard of it.\N- Where does it make berth? Where does it make berth?\NHave you not heard the stories? Captain Barbossa\Nand his crew of miscreants sail from the dreaded Isla de Muerta. It's an island that cannot be found, except by those\Nwho already know where it is. The ship's real enough. Therefore its anchorage\Nmust be a real place. Where is it? Why ask me? Because you're a pirate. And you want to turn pirate yourself,\Nis that it? Never. - They took Miss Swann.\N- Oh, so it is that you found a girl. I see. Well, if you're intending to brave all,\Nhasten to her rescue, and so win fair lady's heart,\Nyou'll have to do it alone, mate. I see no profit in it for me. - I can get you out of here.\N- How's that? The key's run off. I helped build these cells. These are half-pin barrel hinges. With the right leverage\Nand the proper application of strength, the door will lift free. What's your name? Will Turner. That would be short for William,\NI imagine. Good strong name. No doubt named for your father, eh? Yes. Well, Mr. Turner,\NI've changed me mind. If you spring me from this cell,\NI swear on pain of death, I shall take you to the Black Pearl\Nand your bonnie lass. Do we have an accord? - Agreed.\N- Agreed. Get me out. - Hurry. Someone will have heard that.\N- Not without my effects. We're gonna steal the ship. - That ship?\N- Commandeer. We're gonna commandeer that ship.\NNautical term. One question about your business, boy,\Nor there's no use going. This girl,\Nhow far are you willing to go to save her? - I'd die for her.\N- Oh, good. No worries, then. This is either madness or brilliance. It's remarkable\Nhow often those two traits coincide. Everyone, stay calm.\NWe are taking over the ship. Aye. Avast. This ship cannot be crewed\Nby two men. You'll never make it out of the bay. Son, I'm Captain Jack Sparrow. Savvy? - Commodore.\N- Sir, they've taken the Dauntless. Commodore! They've taken the ship! Sparrow and Turner,\Nthey've taken the Dauntless. Rash, Turner. Too rash. That is, without doubt, the worst pirate\NI have ever seen. Here they come. Bring her around! Bring her around! - Hold on!\N- Grab on! Search every cabin, every hold,\Ndown to the bilges. This way, men. - Check the aft.\N- And the portside. - Sailors, back to the Interceptor, now.\N- Quickly, men. Thank you, commodore,\Nfor getting us ready to make way. We'd have had a hard time of it\Nby ourselves. Set topsails and clear up this mess. With the wind a quarter astern,\Nwe won't catch them. I don't need to catch them.\NGet them in range of the long nines. Helm, come about! Run out the guns! We are to fire on our own ship, sir? I'd rather see her at the bottom\Nof the ocean than in the hands of a pirate. Commodore.\NHe's disabled the rudder chain, sir. Abandon ship! - Let go the gear and sheet home.\N- Sheet home, aye, sir. That's got to be the best pirate\NI've ever seen. So it would seem. When I was a lad living in England,\Nmy mother raised me by herself. After she died, I came out here\Nlooking for my father. Is that so? My father? Bill Turner? In the jail, it was only after you learned\Nmy name that you agreed to help. Since that's what I wanted,\NI didn't press the matter. I'm not a simpleton, Jack. You knew my father. I knew him. Probably one of the few\Nwho knew him as William Turner. Everyone else just called him Bootstrap\Nor Bootstrap Bill. Bootstrap? Good man. Good pirate.\NI swear, you look just like him. It's not true.\NHe was a merchant sailor. A good, respectable man\Nwho obeyed the law. He was a bloody pirate. A scallywag. My father was not a pirate. Put it away, son.\NIt's not worth you getting beat again. You didn't beat me. You ignored the rules of engagement.\NIn a fair fight, I'd kill you. Then that's not much incentive\Nfor me to fight fair, then, is it'? Now, as long as you're just hanging there,\Npay attention. The only rules that really matter\Nare these: What a man can do\Nand what a man can't do. For instance, you can accept that\Nyour father was a pirate and a good man, or you can't.\NBut pirate is in your blood, boy, so you'll have to square with that\Nsomeday. Now, me, for example,\NI can let you drown but I can't bring this ship into Tortuga\Nall by me onesies. Savvy? So. Can you sail\Nunder the command of a pirate? Or can you not? Tortuga? Tortuga. More importantly,\Nit is indeed a sad life that has never breathed deep\Nthe sweet, proliferous bouquet that is Tortuga. Savvy? What do you think? It'll linger. I'll tell you, mate if every town in the world\Nwere like this one, no man would ever feel unwanted. Scarlett. Not sure I deserved that. Giselle. - Who was she?\N- What? I may have deserved that. Curse you for breathing,\Nyou slack-jawed idiot. Mother's love. Jack. You should know better\Nthan to wake a man when he's sleeping. - It's bad luck.\N- Fortunately, I know how to counter it. The man who did the waking\Nbuys the man who was sleeping a drink. The man who was sleeping drinks it\Nwhile listening to a proposition from the man who did the waking. Aye. That'll about do it. Blast, I'm already awake! That was for the smell. Keep a sharp eye. Now, what's the nature\Nof this venture of yours? I'm going after the Black Pearl. I know where it's going to be\Nand I'm gonna take it. Jack, it's a fool's errand. Well, you know better than me\Nthe tales of the Black Pearl. That's why I know\Nwhat Barbossa is up to. All I need is a crew. From what I hear tell\Nof Captain Barbossa, he's not a man to suffer fools,\Nnor strike a bargain with one. Then I'd say it's a good thing\NI'm not a fool. Prove me wrong. What makes you think Barbossa\Nwill give up his ship to you? Let's just say\Nit's a matter of leverage, eh? The kid? That is the child\Nof Bootstrap Bill Turner. His only child. Savvy? Is he, now? Leverage, says you.\NI think I feel a change in the wind, says I. I'll find us a crew. There's bound to be some sailors\Non this rock crazy as you. One can only hope. Take what you can. Give nothing back. You'll be dining with the captain. And he requests you wear this. Well, you may tell the captain\Nthat I am disinclined to acquiesce to his request. He said you'd say that. He also said, if that be the case,\Nyou'll be dining with the crew. And you'll be naked. Fine. There is no need to stand on ceremony,\Nno call to impress anyone. You must be hungry. Try the wine. And the apples. One of those next. It's poisoned. There would be no sense\Nto be killing you, Miss Turner. Then release me. You have your trinket,\NI'm of no further value to you. - You don't know what this is, do you?\N- It's a pirate medallion. This is Aztec gold. One of 882 identical pieces\Nthey delivered in a stone chest to Cortés himself. Blood money paid to stem the slaughter\Nhe wreaked upon them with his armies. But the greed of Cortés was insatiable. And so the heathen gods\Nplaced upon the gold a terrible curse. Any mortal that removes\Nbut a single piece from that stone chest shall be punished for eternity. I hardly believe in ghost stories any more,\NCaptain Barbossa. Aye. That's exactly what I thought\Nwhen we were first told the tale. Buried on an Island of the Dead\Nwhat cannot be found except for those who know where it is. Find it, We did. There be the chest. Inside be the gold.\NAnd we took them all. We spent them and traded them and frittered them away on drink and food\Nand pleasurable company. The more we gave them away,\Nthe more we came to realise the drink would not satisfy,\Nfood turned to ash in our mouths, and all the pleasurable company\Nin the world could not slake our lust. We are cursed men, Miss Turner. Compelled by greed we were,\Nbut now we are consumed by it. There is one way\Nwe can end our curse. All the scattered pieces of the Aztec gold\Nmust be restored and the blood repaid. Thanks to you we have the final piece. And the blood to be repaid? That's why there's no sense\Nto be killing you yet. Apple? No! I'm curious. After killing me,\Nwhat is it you're planning on doing next? Oh, no. Look. The moonlight shows us\Nfor what we really are. We are not among the living,\Nand so we cannot die. But neither are we dead. For too long I've been parched of thirst\Nand unable to quench it. Too long I've been starving to death\Nand haven't died. I feel nothing. Not the wind on my face\Nnor the spray of the sea. Nor the warmth of a woman's flesh. You'd best start believing\Nin ghost stories, Miss Turner. You're in one. What are you looking at? Back to work. You heard the captain. Back to work. Feast your eyes, captain.\NAll of them faithful hands before the mast. Every man worth his salt.\NAnd crazy, to boot. So this is your able-bodied crew? - You, sailor.\N- Cotton, sir. Mr. Cotton, do you have the courage\Nand fortitude to follow orders and stay true in the face of danger\Nand almost certain death? Mr. Cotton. Answer, man. He's a mute, sir.\NPoor devil had his tongue cutout. So he trained the parrot to talk for him.\NNo one's yet figured how. Mr. Cotton's parrot. Same question. Wind in your sails. Wind in your sails. - Mostly we figure that means, "Yes."\N- Of course it does. Satisfied? Well, you've proved they're mad. And what's the benefit for us? Anamaria. I suppose you didn't deserve\Nthat one either. - No, that one I deserved.\N- You stole my boat. Actually-- Borrowed.\NBorrowed without permission. But with every intention\Nof bringing it back to you. - But you didn't.\N- You'll get another one. - I will.\N- A better one. A better one. - That one.\N- What one? That one? Aye. That one. What say you? - Aye!\N- Aye! Anchor's aweigh. No, no, no. It's frightful bad luck\Nto bring a woman aboard, sir. It'll be far worse not to have her. How can we sail to an island\Nthat nobody can find - with a compass that doesn't work?\N- Aye, the compass doesn't point north. But we're not trying to find north,\Nare we? We should drop canvas, sir. She can hold a bit longer. What in your head has put you\Nin such a fine mood, captain? We're catching up. Time to go, poppet- Dead men tell no tales. Puts a chill in the bones, how many honest sailors\Nhave been claimed by this passage. How is it that Jack\Ncame by that compass? Not a lot's known about Jack Sparrow\Nbefore he showed up in Tortuga with a mind to go after the treasure\Nof the Isla de Muerta. That was before I'd met him, back when he was captain\Nof the Black Pearl. What? He failed to mention that. Well, he plays things\Nclose to the vest now. And a hard-learned lesson it was.\NThree days out on the venture, the first mate comes to him\Nand says everything's an equal share, that should mean the location\Nof the treasure too. So Jack gives up the bearings.\NThat night there was a mutiny. They marooned Jack on an island\Nand left him to die. But not before he'd gone mad\Nwith the heat. So that's the reason for all the: Reason's got nothing to do with it. Now, Will, when a pirate's marooned, he's given a pistol with a single shot.\NOne shot. Well, that won't do much good hunting\Nor to be rescued. But after three weeks\Nof a starving belly and thirst, that pistol starts to look real friendly. But Jack, he escaped the island,\Nand he still has that single shot. Oh, he won't use it, though,\Nsave on one man. His mutinous first mate. - Barbossa.\N- Aye. - How did Jack get off the island?\N- Well, I'll tell you. He waded out into the shallows and he waited there three days\Nand three nights till all manner of sea creatures\Nbecame acclimated to his presence. Then on the fourth morning he roped himself a couple of sea turtles,\Nlashed them together and made a raft. - He roped a couple of sea turtles.\N- Aye, sea turtles. What did he use for rope? Human hair. From my back. - Let go the anchor.\N- Lower the anchor line! Young Mr. Turner and I\Nare to go ashore. Captain,\Nwhat if the worst should happen? - Keep to the Code.\N- Aye, the Code. Move. Ten years of hoarding swag\Nand now we finally get to spend it. Once we're quit of the curse,\Nwe'll be rich men. And you can buy an eye\Nwhat actually fits and is made of glass. This one does splinter\Nsomething terrible. Stop rubbing it. What code is Gibbs to keep to\Nif the worst should happen? Pirates' Code.\NAny man who falls behind is left behind. No heroes amongst thieves, eh? You know, for having\Nsuch a bleak outlook on pirates you're well on your way\Nto becoming one. Sprung a man from jail,\Ncommandeered a ship of the fleet, sailed with a buccaneer crew\Nout of Tortuga. And you're completely obsessed\Nwith treasure. That's not true.\NI am not obsessed with treasure. Not all treasure is silver and gold, mate. Gentlemen, the time has come.\NOur salvation is nigh. - Our torment is near an end.\N- Elizabeth. For ten years\Nwe've been tested and tried, and each man-jack of you here has proved his mettle\Na hundred times over. And a hundred times again. Suffered I have. Punished we were, the lot of us.\NDisproportionate to our crime. Here it is. The cursed treasure of Cortés himself. Every last piece that went astray\Nwe have returned. Save for this. - Jack.\N- Not yet. We wait for the opportune moment. Saving what we found,\Ndespairing of ever finding the last. When's that?\NWhen it's of greatest profit to you? May I ask you something? Have I ever given you reason\Nnot to trust me? Do us a favour. I know it's difficult\Nfor you, but please stay here. And try not to do anything stupid. And who among us has paid\Nthe blood sacrifice owed to the heathen gods? - And whose blood must yet be paid?\N- Hers! You know the first thing I'm gonna do\Nafter the curse is lifted? Eat a whole bushel of apples. Begun by blood. By blood undone. Sorry, Jack.\NI'm not gonna be your leverage. That's it? Waste not. Did it work? - I don't feel no different.\N- How do we tell? You're not dead. No. - You shot me.\N- It didn't work. The curse is still upon us. You. Maid. Your father.\NWhat was his name? Was your father William Turner? - No.\N- Where's his child? The child that sailed\Nfrom England eight years ago. The child in whose veins\Nflows the blood of William Turner? Where? You two.\NYou brought us the wrong person. No. She had the medallion.\NShe's the proper age. She said her name was Turner.\NYou heard her. I think she lied to us. You brought us here for nothing? I won't take questioning\Nor second guesses, not from the likes of you, Master Twigg. Who's to blame him? Every decision you've made\Nhas led us from bad to worse. It was you who sent Bootstrap\Nto the depths. And it's you who brought us here\Nin the first place. If any coward here\Ndare challenge me, let him speak. I say we cut her throat\Nand spill all her blood, just in case. Yeah. The medallion! She's taken it! Get after her,\Nyou feckless pack of ingrates. - There's no oars here.\N- Where's the oars? - They stole the oars.\N- The oars have gone missing. Find them. Find the oars. You. You're supposed to be dead. Am I not? Pearlie. Pa-la-la-leh-loo-loo. Parlinny. Parsnip. Parsley. Par-- - Par-- No, partner.\N- Parley? That's the one. Parley. - Parley.\N- Parley? Damn to the depths whatever\Nmuttonhead thought up parley. That would be the French. - Not more pirates.\N- Welcome aboard, Miss Elizabeth. Mr. Gibbs? Hey, boy, where be Jack? Jack? Jack Sparrow? Fell behind. Keep to the Code. Weigh anchor. Hoist the sails.\NSplit-quick, you dibbies. How the blazes\Ndid you get off that island? When you marooned me\Non that godforsaken spit of land, you forgot one very important thing,\Nmate. I'm Captain Jack Sparrow. Well, I won't be making that mistake\Nagain. Gents, you all remember\NCaptain Jack Sparrow. - Yeah.\N- Aye. Kill him. The girl's blood didn't work, did it? Hold your fire. You know whose blood we need. I know whose blood you need. What sort of a man\Ntrades a man's life for a ship? Pirate. - Here. Let me.\N- Thank you. You said you gave Barbossa\Nmy name as yours. Why? I don't know. I'm sorry. Blacksmith's hands.\NI know they're rough. No. I mean, yes, they are but-- But don't stop. Elizabeth. It's yours. I thought I'd lost it\Nthe day they rescued me. It was a gift from my father. He sent it to me. Why did you take it? Because I was afraid\Nthat you were a pirate. That would have been awful. It wasn't your blood they needed. It was my father's blood. My blood. - The blood of a pirate.\N- Will, I'm so sorry. Please forgive me. So you expect to leave me standing\Non some beach with nothing but a name\Nand your word it's the one I need, and watch you sail away in my ship? No. I expect to leave you\Nstanding on some beach with absolutely no name at all,\Nwatching me sail away on my ship, and then I'll shout the name\Nback to you. Savvy? But that leaves us with the problem\Nof me standing on some beach with nought but a name\Nand your word it's the one I need. Of the two of us, I am the only one\Nwho hasn't committed mutiny. Therefore,\Nmy word is the one we'll be trusting. Although, I suppose\NI should be thanking you, because, in fact, if you hadn't betrayed me\Nand left me to die I would have an equal share in that curse,\Nsame as you. Funny old world, isn't it? Captain, we're coming up\Non the Interceptor. I'm having a thought here, Barbossa. What say we run up a flag of truce,\NI scurry over to the Interceptor, and I negotiate the return\Nof your medallion? What say you to that? Now, you see, Jack, that's exactly the attitude\Nthat lost you the Pearl. People are easier to search\Nwhen they're dead. Lock him in the brig. Hands aloft to loose the gallants! With this wind dead astern,\Nshe'll carry every sail we've got. - What's happening?\N- The Black Pearl. She's gaining on us. But this is the fastest ship\Nin the Caribbean. You can tell them that\Nafter they've caught us. - We're shallower on the draught, right?\N- Aye. Well, then can't we lose them\Namongst those shoals? We don't have to outrun them long.\NJust long enough. Lighten the ship. Stem to stern. Anything we can afford to lose,\Nsee that it's lost. Apparently, there's a leak. Haul on the main brace!\NMake ready the guns! Run out the sweeps. Heave, ho! We're gonna need that. - It was a good plan up till now.\N- Gibbs, we have to make a stand. We must fight. Load the guns. - With what?\N- Anything. Everything. Anything we have left. Load the guns! Case shot and langrage.\NNails and crushed glass. With a Will! The Pearl's gonna luff up\Non our port quarter. She'll rake us\Nwithout ever presenting a target. Lower the anchor on the right side. - On the starboard side.\N- It certainly has the element of surprise. - You're daft, lady. You both are.\N- Daft like Jack. Lower the starboard anchor! Do it, you gobs,\Nor it's you we'll load into the cannons. Starboard anchor, lower away. Let go! They're club hauling.\NHard a port. Rack the starboard oars. - Hard a port.\N- Starboard oars. Keep her steady, man. - Now!\N- Fire! Fire all! Stop blowing holes in my ship. - Fire!\N- Fire! - We could use a few more ideas, lass.\N- Your turn. - We need us a devil's dowry.\N- We'll give them her. She's not what they're after. The medallion. Strike your colours,\Nyou blooming cockroaches. Hands, grapnels at the ready.\NPrepare to board. Pistols and cutlasses, men. Koehler, Twigg.\NTo the powder magazine! And the rest of you,\Nbring me the medallion! Hey! Hey! Hey! Below! Thanks very much. Jack! Bloody empty- That's not very nice. - Where's the medallion?\N- Wretch! Where is dear William? Will. - Will.\N- Elizabeth. Monkey. I can't move it. - Come on, you.\N- No! Will! - Elizabeth!\N- Will! Why, thank you, Jack. - You're welcome.\N- Not you. We named the monkey Jack. Gents, our hope is restored. If any of you so much as thinks\Nthe word parley, I'll have your guts for garters. Will. - You godless savage!\N- Welcome back, miss. You took advantage\Nof our hospitality last time. It holds fair now you return the favour. Barbossa. Will. - She goes free.\N- What's in your head, boy? She goes free. You've only got one shot,\Nand we can't die. Don't do anything stupid. You can't. I can. Like that. Who are you? No one. He's no one. A distant cousin\Nof my aunt's nephew twice removed. Lovely singing voice, though. Eunuch. My name is Will Turner.\NMy father was Bootstrap Bill Turner. His blood runs in my veins. He's the spitting image\Nof old Bootstrap Bill, come back to haunt us. On my word, do as I say or I'll pull this trigger\Nand be lost to Davy Jones' locker. Name your terms, Mr. Turner. - Elizabeth goes free.\N- Yes, we know that one. Anything else? And the crew.\NThe crew are not to be harmed. Agreed. Go on, poppet. Walk the plank. Go. Go on, then. Barbossa, you lying bastard. - You swore she'd go free.\N- Don't dare impugn me honour, boy. I agreed she'd go free, but it was you who failed to specify\Nwhen or where. Though it does seem a shame\Nto lose something so fine, don't it, lads? So I'll be having that dress back\Nbefore you go. I always liked you. It goes with your black heart. It's still warm. Off you go. Come on. Too long. I'd really rather hoped\Nwe were past all this. Jack. Jack. Did you not notice? That be the same little island\Nthat we made you governor of on our last little trip. I did notice. Perhaps you'll be able to conjure up\Nanother miraculous escape. But I doubt it. Off you go. Last time you left me\Na pistol with one shot. By the powers, you're right.\NWhere be Jack's pistol? Bring it forward. Seeing as there's two of us, a gentleman\Nwould give us a pair of pistols. It'll be one pistol as before,\Nand you can be the gentleman and shoot the lady\Nand starve to death yourself. That's the second time I've had to watch\Nthat man sail away with my ship. But you were marooned\Non this island before, weren't you? We can escape the same way you did. To what point and purpose,\Nyoung Missy? The Black Pearl is gone. And unless you have a rudder\Nand a lot of sails hidden in that bodice-- Unlikely. --Young Mr. Turner will be dead\Nlong before you can reach him. But you're Captain Jack Sparrow. You vanished from under the eyes of\Nseven agents of the East India Company. You sacked Nassau port\Nwithout even firing a shot. Are you the pirate I've read about\Nor not? How did you escape last time? Last time I was here a grand total\Nof three days, all right? Last time the rumrunners who used this island\Nas a cache came by, and I was able to barter passage off. From the looks of things,\Nthey've long been out of business. Probably have your bloody friend\NNorrington to thank for that. So that's it, then? That's the secret grand adventure\Nof the infamous Jack Sparrow? You spent three days lying on a beach\Ndrinking rum. Welcome to the Caribbean, love. We're devils, we're black sheep\NWe're really bad eggs Drink up, me hearties, yo ho Yo ho, yo ho A pirate's life for me I love this song. Really bad egg. When I get the Pearl back I'm gonna teach it to the whole crew\Nand we'll sing it all the time. And you will be positively the most\Nfearsome pirates in the Spanish Main. Not just the Spanish Main, love\NThe entire ocean. The entire world. Wherever we want to go, we go.\NThat's what a ship is, you know. It's not just a keel and a hull\Nand a deck and sails. That's what a ship needs. But what a ship is-- What the Black Pearl really is is freedom. Jack. It must be really terrible for you\Nto be trapped on this island. Oh, yes. But the company is infinitely better\Nthan last time, and the scenery\Nhas definitely improved. Mr. Sparrow, I'm not entirely sure\Nthat I've had enough rum to allow that kind of talk. I know exactly what you mean, love. To freedom. To the Black Pearl. No. Not good. Stop. Not good. What are you doing? You burned all the food,\Nthe shade, the rum. - Yes, the rum is gone.\N- Why is the rum gone? One, because it is a vile drink that turns even the most respectable men\Ninto complete scoundrels. Two, that signal\Nis over a thousand feet high. The entire Royal Navy\Nis out looking for me. Do you really think that there\Nis even the slightest chance - that they won't see it?\N- But why is the rum gone? Just wait, Captain Sparrow. You give it one hour, maybe two,\Nkeep a weather eye open, and you will see white sails\Non that horizon. "It must have been terrible for you\Nto be trapped here, Jack. Must have been terrible for you--"\NWell, it bloody is now! There'll be no living with her after this. - But we've got to save Will.\N- No. You're safe now. We will return to Port Royal immediately,\Nnot go gallivanting after pirates. Then we condemn him to death. The boy's fate is regrettable. But then, so was his decision\Nto engage in piracy. To rescue me. To prevent anything\Nfrom happening to me. If I may be so bold as to interject\Nmy professional opinion, the Pearl was listing near to scuppers\Nafter the battle. It's very unlikely\Nshe'll be able to make good time. Think about it. The Black Pearl. The last real pirate threat\Nin the Caribbean, mate. How can you pass that up, eh? By remembering that I serve others\NMr. Sparrow, not only myself. Commodore, I beg you, please do this.\NFor me. As a wedding gift. Elizabeth. Are you accepting\Nthe commodore's proposal? I am. A wedding. I love weddings.\NDrinks all around. I know. Clap him in irons, right? Mr. Sparrow, you will accompany\Nthese fine men to the helm and provide us with a bearing\Nto Isla de Muerta. You'll then spend the rest of the voyage\Ncontemplating all possible meanings of the phrase "silent as the grave."\NDo I make myself clear? Inescapably clear. - Shiver me timbers.\N- Cotton here says you missed a bit. You knew William Turner? Old Bootstrap Bill. We knew him. Never sat well with Bootstrap\Nwhat we did to Jack Sparrow. The mutiny and all. He said it wasn't right with the Code. That's why he sent off a piece\Nof the treasure to you, as it were. He said we deserved to be cursed and remain cursed. - Stupid blighter.\N- Good man. But, as you can imagine, that didn't sit too well with the captain. That didn't sit too well\Nwith the captain at all. - Tell him what Barbossa did.\N- I'm telling the story. So, what the captain did, he strapped a cannon\Nto Bootstrap's bootstraps. - Bootstrap's bootstraps.\N- The last we saw of old Bill Turner he was sinking to the crushing black\Noblivion of Davy Jones' locker. Of course, it was only after that, we learned we needed his blood\Nto lift the curse. That's what you call ironic. Bring him. I don't care for the situation. Any attempt to storm the caves\Ncould turn to an ambush. Not if you're the one\Ndoing the ambushing. I go in and convince Barbossa\Nto send his men out with their little boats. You and your mates\Nreturn to the Dauntless and blast the bejesus out of them\Nwith your little cannons, aye. - What do you have to lose?\N- Nothing I'd lament being rid of. Now, to be quite honest with you, there's still a risk\Nto those aboard the Dauntless, which includes\Nthe future Mrs. Commodore. Sorry, but it's for your own safety. I don't care what the commodore ordered.\NI have to tell him. The pirates.\NThey're cursed, they can't be killed. Don't worry, miss,\Nhe's already informed of that. A little mermaid flopped up on deck\Nand told him the whole story. This is Jack Sparrow's doing. No reason to fret. Just a prick\Nof the finger. A few drops of blood. No mistakes this time.\NHe's only half Turner. We spill it all. Guess there is reason to fret. Beg your pardon, beg your pardon. - Begun by blood.\N- Excuse me. By blood and-- Jack. - It's not possible.\N- Not probable. Where's Elizabeth? She's safe, just like I promised. She's all set to marry Norrington,\Njust like she promised. And you get to die for her,\Njust like you promised. So we're all men of our word, really. Except for Elizabeth,\Nwho is, in fact, a woman. Shut up. You're next. - You don't want to be doing that, mate.\N- No, I really think I do. Your funeral. Why don't I want to be doing it? Well, because-- Because the HMS Dauntless,\Npride of the Royal Navy, is floating just offshore, waiting for you. What we doing here? The pirates come out,\Nunprepared and unawares. We catch them in a crossfire,\Nsend them down to see Old Hob. I know why we're here. I meant, why aren't we doing what it was\Nwhat Mr. Sparrow said we should do? - With the cannons and all?\N- Because it was Mr. Sparrow who said it. You think he wasn't telling the truth? Just hear me out, mate. Order your men to the Dauntless.\NThey do what they do best. Robert's your uncle, Fannie's your aunt.\NThere you are with two ships. The makings of your very own fleet. Of course, you'll take the grandest\Nas your flagship, and who's to argue? But what of the Pearl? Name me captain. I'll sail under your colours,\NI'll give you 10 percent of me plunder, and you get to introduce yourself\Nas Commodore Barbossa. - Savvy?\N- I suppose in exchange, - you want me not to kill the whelp.\N- No, no, no. Not at all. By all means, kill the whelp. Just not yet. Wait to lift the curse\Nuntil the opportune moment. For instance, after you've killed Norrington's men. Every last one. You've been planning this\Nfrom the beginning. - Ever since you learned my name.\N- Yeah. I want 50 percent of your plunder. - Fifteen.\N- Forty. Twenty-five. I'll buy you the hat. A really big one, commodore. We have an accord. All hands to the boats. Apologies. You give the orders. Gents, take a walk. Not to the boats? Hold fire. Oh, this is just like what the Greeks done\Nat Troy. Except they was in a horse\Ninstead of dresses. Wooden horse. A moment, please. Elizabeth. I just want you to know, I-- I believe you made\Na very good decision today. Couldn't be more proud of you. But you know, even a good decision,\Nif made for the wrong reasons, can be a wrong decision. - Look into that, will you? Report back.\N- Lieutenant? Elizabeth. Are you there? Elizabeth, are you even listening to me? Oh, what have you done? Stop that. Already feel like a fool. Look nice, though. I look nice? I must admit, Jack,\NI thought I had you figured. But it turns out\Nyou're a hard man to predict. Me? I'm dishonest. And a dishonest man\Nyou can always trust to be dishonest. Honestly. It's the honest ones\Nyou want to watch out for, because you can never predict when they're gonna do something\Nincredibly stupid. You're off the edge of the map, mate.\NHere there be monsters. Right. - What would you pick to eat first?\N- I think we should decide now. Just so we're ready\Nwhen the time comes. What was that? Miss Elizabeth. Make for the ship. Move. To the ship! Row, men. You can't beat me, Jack. That's interesting. I couldn't resist, mate. Sorry. So, what now, Jack Sparrow? Are we to be two immortals\Nlocked in an epic battle until judgment day\Nand the trumpets sound? Or you could surrender. All of you with me.\NWill is in that cave and we must save him. Ready. And heave. Please, I need your help. Come on. - Any port in a storm.\N- Cotton's right. We've got the Pearl. What about Jack?\NAre you just gonna leave him? - Jack owes us a ship.\N- And there's the Code to consider. The Code? You're pirates.\NHang the Code and hang the rules. They're more like guidelines anyway. Bloody pirates. - What?\N- Is it supposed to be doing that? - They're stealing our ship.\N- Bloody pirates. Boarders away. Come on! Me eye. - I'm gonna teach you the meaning of pain.\N- Do you like pain? Try wearing a corset. - Whose side is Jack on?\N- At the moment? No fair. Ten years you carry that pistol,\Nand now you waste your shot. He didn't waste it. I feel... cold. Parley? The ship is ours, gentlemen. We should return to the Dauntless. Your fiancé will be wanting to know\Nyou're safe. If you were waiting\Nfor the opportune moment... that was it. Now, if you'd be so kind, I'd be much obliged\Nif you'd drop me off at my ship. I'm sorry, Jack. They done what's right by them.\NCan't expect more than that. "Jack Sparrow, be it known\Nthat you have been charged..." Captain. Captain Jack Sparrow. "For your wilful commission\Nof crimes against the Crown. Said crimes being numerous in quantity\Nand sinister in nature. The most egregious of these\Nto be cited herewith. - Piracy, smuggling..."\N- This is wrong. Commodore Norrington\Nis bound by the law. As are we all. "Impersonating an officer\Nof the Spanish Royal Navy. Impersonating a cleric\Nof the Church of England..." - Oh, yeah.\N- "...sailing under false colours, arson, kidnapping, looting, poaching, brigandage, pilfering, depravity,\Ndepredation, and general lawlessness. And for these crimes,\Nyou have been sentenced to be, on this day,\Nhung by the neck until dead. May God have mercy on your soul." Governor Swann. Commodore. Elizabeth. I should have told you every day\Nfrom the moment I met you. I love you. Watch yourself. - Marines.\N- I can't breathe. Elizabeth. Move. - You men, quickly!\N- What? Move. Come on. Come on! - Right, right.\N- Come on, lads. I thought we might have to endure some manner\Nof ill-conceived escape attempt. But not from you. On our return to Port Royal,\NI granted you clemency. And this is how you thank me?\NBy throwing in your lot with him? - He's a pirate.\N- And a good man. If all I've achieved here\Nis the hangman will earn two pairs of boots\Ninstead of one, so be it. - At least my conscience will be clear.\N- You forget your place, Turner. It's right here, between you and Jack. - As is mine.\N- Elizabeth. Lower your weapons. For goodness' sake, put them down. So this is where\Nyour heart truly lies, then? It is. Well, I'm actually feeling\Nrather good about this. I think we've all arrived\Nat a special place, eh? Spiritually, ecumenically,\Ngrammatically. I want you to know\Nthat I was rooting for you, mate. Know that. Elizabeth. It would never have worked\Nbetween us, darling. I'm sorry. Will. Nice hat. Friends. This is a day that you will\Nalways remember as the day that-- Idiot. He's nowhere to go\Nbut back to the noose. Sail ho! What's your plan of action? Sir? Perhaps on the rare occasion pursuing the right course\Ndemands an act of piracy, piracy itself can be the right course? Mr. Turner. I will accept the consequences\Nof my actions. This is a beautiful sword. I would expect the man who made it\Nto show the same care and devotion in every aspect of his life. Thank you. Commodore. What about Sparrow? Well, I think we can afford\Nto give him one day's head start. So. This is the path you've chosen, is it? After all, he is a blacksmith. No. He's a pirate. Heave. Thought you were supposed to keep\Nto the Code. We figured\Nthey were more actual guidelines. Thank you. Captain Sparrow. The Black Pearl is yours. On deck, you scabrous dogs.\NHands to braces. Let down and haul to run free. Now, bring me that horizon. And really bad eggs. Drink up, me hearties.
