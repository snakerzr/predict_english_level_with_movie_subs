Evil! TOULOUSE:\NA little shy Turn away from this village of sin! TOULOUSE:\NAnd sad of eye But very wise Was he And then one day A magic day He passed my way And while we spoke of many things Fools and kings This he said to me The greatest thing You'll ever learn Is just to love And be loved In return CHRISTIAN:\NThe Moulin Rouge. A nightclub... ...a dance hall and a bordello... ...ruled over by Harold Zidler. A kingdom of nighttime pleasures... ...where the rich and powerful\Nplayed with... ...the young and beautiful creatures\Nof the underworld. The most beautiful of all these... ...was the woman who I loved. Satine. A courtesan, she sold her love to men. They called her\N"The Sparkling Diamond." And she was the star... ...of the Moulin Rouge. The woman I loved... ...is... ...dead. I first came to Paris... ...one year ago. lt was  1 899, the Summer of Love. I knew nothing of the Moulin Rouge,\NHarold Zidler or Satine. The world had been swept up in\Na Bohemian revolution, and l had... ...travelled from London to be a part of it. On the hill near Paris\Nwas the village of Montmartre. It was not,\Nas my father said-- A village of sin. --but the center of\Nthe Bohemian world. Musicians, painters, writers. They were known as\Nthe Children of the Revolution. Yes. I had come to live a penniless\Nexistence. I had come to... ...write about truth, beauty,\Nfreedom... ...and that which l believed in\Nabove all things: love. Always this ridiculous obsession\Nwith love! There was only one problem. I'd never been in love. Luckily, right at that moment, an unconscious\NArgentinean fell through my roof. [YELLS] He was joined by a dwarf\Ndressed as a nun. How do you do? My name is Henri Marie Raymond\NToulouse-Lautrec-Montfa. I'm terribly sorry. We were upstairs\Nrehearsing a play. A play. Something very modern called\NSpectacular Spectacular. It's set in Switzerland. Unfortunately, he unconscious Argentinean\Nsuffered from narcolepsy. TOULOUSE: Perfectly fine\None moment, then suddenly: [IMITATES SNORING] ...unconscious the next. Ha, ha.\NAUDREY: How is he? Wonderful. The narcoleptic Argentinean\Nis unconscious. Therefore the scenario will not be finished\Nto present to the financier tomorrow. I still have to finish the music.\NWe just find someone to read the part. Where in heaven's name are we going\Nto find someone to read the role... ...of the young, sensitive\NSwiss poet goatherder? Before I knew it, I was upstairs, standing in\Nfor the unconscious Argentinean. TOULOUSE [SINGING]:\NThe hills animate With the euphonious symphonies\NOf descant Oh, stop!\NStop that insufferable droning! It's drowning out my words! Can we just stick\Nto a little decorative piano? There seemed to be artistic differences\Nover Audrey's lyrics to Satie's song. Don't think a nun would say that\Nabout a hill. What if he sings, "The hills are vital\Nintoning the descant"? "The hills quake and shake--"\NNo, no, no. "The hills--" "The hills are incarnate\Nwith symphonic melodies"! No.\N"The hills--" "The hills--" "The hills--"\N"The hills--" [CHATTERING] [SINGING]\NThe hills Are alive With the sound of Music "The hills are alive with\Nthe sound of music." I love it! The hills are alive....\NWith the sound.... [SINGING]\NOf music. It fits perfectly! With songs they have sung For a thousand years [GASPING] Incandiferous! Audrey, you should write the show together.\NI beg your pardon? But Toulouse's suggestion that\NAudrey and I write together... ...was not what Audrey wanted to hear.\NGoodbye! Here's to your first job in Paris. Toulouse, Zidler will never agree. No offense, but have you ever\Nwritten anything like this before? No.\NAh! The boy has talent! I like him. Nothing funny. I just like talent. "The hills are alive\Nwith the sound of music." With Christian, we can write... ...the truly Bohemian revolutionary show\Nwe always dreamt of. How will we convince Zidler? Toulouse had a plan. Satine. They would dress me\Nin the Argentinian's best suit... ...and pass me off\Nas a famous English writer. Once Satine heard my poetry, she'd be\Nastounded and insist to Zidler that... ...I write Spectacular Spectacular. The only problem was\NI kept hearing my father's voice: You'll end up wasting your life at\Nthe Moulin Rouge with a cancan dancer! I can't write the show for the Moulin Rouge!\NWhy not? I don't even know if I am\Na true Bohemian revolutionary. Do you believe in beauty?\NYes. Freedom?\NYes, of course. Truth?\NYes. Love? Love? Love? Above all things,\NI believe in love. Love is like oxygen.\NLove is a many-splendored thing. Love lifts us up where we belong.\NAll you need is love! See, you can't fool us. You're the voice of\Nthe Children of the Revolution. We can't be fooled! Let's drink to the new writer of the world's\Nfirst Bohemian revolutionary show! It was the perfect plan.

Oh, but we have so much to do.\NSo much work. If the young writer\Ncan carry a blanket and basket... ...you can both do it in my presence. So the sitar player falls from the roof--\NYes, I know, I know. Don't tell me. "The greatest thing you'll ever--" Still at it, my sweet? "Master. Make. Contract." My dear Duke, so many lines to learn.\NI've been drilling them over and over. For try as the Duke may,\Nit was almost too easy... ...for the young writer and actress to invent\Nperfectly legitimate reasons to avoid him. Mademoiselle Satine, I haven't\Nquite finished writing that new scene. The "Will the lovers be meeting at the\Nsitar player's humble abode?" scene. And I wondered if I could work on it\Nwith you later tonight? But, my dear, I arranged a magnificent\Nsupper for us in the gothic tower. It's not important.\NWe can work on it tomorrow. How dare you.\NIt cannot wait until tomorrow. "The lovers will meet at the sitar player's\Nhumble abode" scene is the most important. We'll work on it tonight\Nuntil I'm completely satisfied. But, my dear--\NDear Duke, excuse me. I'm sorry. ZIDLER:\NNice work, family! Bright and early tomorrow morning,\Nwe begin on Act Two: The lovers are discovered. Zidler. My dear Duke, everything is arranged\Nfor that supper in the gothic tower tonight. You might as well eat it yourself! Her affections are waning!\NImpossible. I understand how important her work is,\Nbut she's always at it with that damn writer! If I don't see her tonight,\NI'm leaving! No, dear Duke!\NI'll insist Satine takes the night off. All right. All right. Eight o'clock, then. You'll come tonight? Yes. What time?\NEight o'clock. Promise?\NYes. Go. Are you mad? The Duke holds the deeds\Nto the Moulin Rouge. He's spending a fortune on you. He's given you a beautiful new dressing\Nroom. He wants to make you a star. And you're dallying with the writer. Harold, don't be rid--\NI saw you together! It's nothing. It's just an infatuation.\NIt's nothing. The infatuation will end. Go to the boy. Tell him it's over. The Duke is expecting you\Nin the tower at 8. SATINE [SINGlNG IN VOICE-OVER]:\NIf I should die This very moment I wouldn't fear For I've never known completeness Like being here Wrapped in the warmth of you Loving every breath of you Why live life From dream To dream? And dread the day [WHEEZING] How could I know... ...in those last fatal days... [COUGHlNG] ...that a force darker\Nthan jealousy... ...and stronger than love... ...had begun to take hold... ...of Satine? Where is she? MARIE: Will she be up and about by tonight?\NTomorrow morning at the earliest. The Duke's leaving! She's confessing! Confessing? What kind of imbecile\Ndo you take me for, Zidler? She suddenly had a terrible desire... ...to go to a priest and... ...confess her sins.\NWhat? She wanted to be cleansed\Nof her former life. She looks upon tonight\Nas her wedding night. Her wedding night? She's like a blushing bride. She says you make her feel like a... ...virgin. Virgin? You know. Touched... ...for the very first time. She says it feels so good inside... ...when you hold her... ...and you touch her. Like a virgin. She's made it through the wilderness\Nsomehow. She's made it through. [SINGING]\NShe didn't know how lost she was Until she found you She was beat\NIncomplete She'd been had\NShe was sad and blue But you made her feel Yes, you made her feel Shiny and new Like a virgin Touched for the very first time Like a virgin When your hearts beat\NBoth in time Gonna give you all her love Her fear is fading fast Been saving it all for you\NOnly love can last She's so fine\NAnd she's thine She'll be yours\NTill the end of time 'Cause you made her feel Yes, you made her feel\NShe has nothing to hide Like a virgin Touched for the very first time Like a virgin When your hearts beat\NBoth in time Like a virgin Feels so good inside When you hold her and you touch her [SINGING] She's so fine\NAnd she's mine Makes me strong Yes, she makes me bold\NNow her love thawed out Yes, her love thawed out What was scared and cold Like a virgin Touched for the very first time ZIDLER:\NLike a virgin When your hearts beat\NBoth in time ZIDLER:\NLike a virgin Feels so good inside When you hold her\NAnd you touch her Ahhhhh\NAhhhhh Like a virgin\NLike a virgin Harold Zidler's brilliant lies had\Nonce again averted disaster. But no lie, however brilliant,\Ncould save Satine. DOCTOR:\NMonsieur Zidler... ...Mademoiselle Satine is dying.\NShe has consumption. My little sparrow is dying? She mustn't know, Marie. The show must go on. CHRISTIAN: All night, the penniless\Nsitar player had waited. And now, for the first time... ...he felt the cold stab of jealousy. [COUGHlNG] Where were you last night? I told you... ...I was sick. You don't have to lie to me. We have to end it. Everyone knows. Harold knows. Sooner or later,\Nthe Duke will find out too. On opening night,\NI have to sleep with the Duke. And the jealousy will drive you mad. Christian--\NThen I'll write a song. We'll put it in the show and no matter\Nhow bad things get or whatever happens... ...whenever you hear it or sing it\Nor whistle it or hum it... ...then you'll know it'll mean\Nwe love one other. l won't get jealous. Things don't work that way, Christian. We have to end it. [SINGING]\NNever knew I could feel like this Like I've never seen the sky Before Want to vanish Inside your kiss CHRISTIAN: This new scene is\Nthe scene where the sitar player... ...writes a secret song for the courtesan,\Nso that whatever is happening... ...however bad things are,\Nthey remember their love. We could take it from your line, Satine.\NLet's take it from there. We must be careful. Fear not. We will conduct our\Nlove affair right under the maharajah's-- [SINGING]\NSeasons may change Winter to spring Honestly, amigo, this is impossible! But I love you Until the end Of time Come what may I will love you Until my dying day Suddenly, the world\NSuddenly, the world Seems such a perfect place\NSeems such a perfect place My dear, a little frog! Suddenly it moves\NSuddenly it moves With such a perfect grace\NWith such a perfect grace Suddenly my life doesn't\NSuddenly my life doesn't Seem such a waste\NSeem such a waste It all revolves around you\NIt all revolves around you And there's no mountain\NAnd there's no mountain Too high\NToo high No river too wide\NNo river too wide Sing out this song and I'll be\NSing out this song and I'll be There by your side\NThere by your side Storm clouds may gather\NStorm clouds may gather And stars may collide\NAnd stars may collide But I love you I love you Until the end\NUntil the end Of time\NOf time Come what may\NCome what may I will love you\NI will love you The magical sitar player\Nfalls from the roof and says: "The greatest thing you'll\Never learn... ...is just to love and be loved\Nin return." This ending is silly. Why would the courtesan\Ngo for the penniless writer? Whoops. l mean, sitar player. CHORUS [SINGING]:\NCome what may I will love you Come what may Yes, I will love you Come what may I will love you Till my dying day I don't like this ending. Don't like the ending, my dear Duke? DUKE:\NWhy would the courtesan choose... ...a penniless sitar player\Nover the maharajah... ...who is offering a lifetime of\Nsecurity? That's real love. Once the sitar player\Nhas satisfied his lust... ...he will leave the courtesan\Nwith nothing. I suggest that in the end,\Nthe courtesan choose the maharajah. But, but.... Sorry. Sorry, but that ending does not uphold\Nthe Bohemian ideals of... ...truth, beauty, freedom-- I don't care about\Nyour ridiculous dogma! Why shouldn't the courtesan\Nchoose the maharajah? Because she doesn't love you! Him. Him. She doesn't love.... She doesn't love him. Now I see. Monsieur Zidler. This ending will be rewritten... ...with the courtesan choosing\Nthe maharajah... ...and without the lovers' secret song. It will be rehearsed in the morning,\Nready for the opening tomorrow night. My dear Duke,\Nthat will be quite impossible. Harold. The poor Duke is\Nbeing treated appallingly. These silly writers let their\Nimaginations run away with them. Why don't you and I... ...have a little supper? Then afterwards... ...we can let Monsieur Zidler know\Nhow we would prefer the story to end. Thank you, Elizabeth. I don't want you to sleep with him. He could destroy everything. It's for us. You promised. You promised me\Nyou wouldn't be jealous. It will be all right. Yes, it will. He's waiting.\NNo. No. [SINGING]\NCome What may Come what may. She had gone to the tower\Nto save us all. And for our part... ...we could do nothing but wait. SATINE: My dear Duke. I hope\NI have not kept you waiting. Don't worry, Shakespeare.\NYou'll get your ending. Once the Duke gets his... ...end in. ARGENTlNEAN:\NNini. No, no. NINI:\NYou keep your hands off me! Never fall in love with a woman\Nwho sells herself. It always ends bad! The boy has a ridiculous\Nobsession with me. I mean, I indulge his fantasy\Nbecause he's talented. We need him.\NBut only until tomorrow night. We have a dance... ...in the brothels of Buenos Aires. It tells the story... ...of a prostitute... [PEOPLE OOHING AND LAUGHING] ...and a man... ...who falls in love... ...with her. First... ...there is desire! Then passion! Then suspicion! Jealousy! Anger! Betrayal! When love is for the highest bidder,\Nthere can be no trust. Without trust, there is no love! Jealousy-- Yes, jealousy. --will drive you mad!
