13 meters. You should see it. Okay, take her up and over the bow rail. Okay, Mir-2, we're going over the bow.\NStay with us. Okay, quiet. We're rolling. Seeing her coming out of the darkness\Nlike a ghost ship ... still gets me every time. To see the sad ruin of the great ship,\Nsitting here ... where she landed at 2:30 in the morning\Nof April 15, 1912 ... after her long fall ... from the world above. You're so full of shit, boss. Dive 6. Here we are again on the deck of Titanic. 2½ miles down. 3,821 meters. The pressure outside\Nis 3½ tons per square inch. These windows are 9 inches thick\Nand if they go ... it's sayonara in 2 microseconds. All right, enough of that bullshit. Just put her down on the roof\Nof the officers' quarters like yesterday. Sure. Okay, Mir-2, we're landing\Nright over the Grand Staircase. You guys set to launch? Yeah, Brock, launching Dunkin now.\NGo, Charlie. - All right, tether out.\N- Tether out. Okay, Brock,\Nwe're dropping down along the hull. Yeah, roger that. Okay, drop down,\Nand go into the first-class gangway door. I want you guys working the "D" deck\Nreception area and the dining saloon. Copy that. - Tether out.\N- Tether out. Okay, now left. Now left. Left, left. Snoop Dog is on the move.\NWe're headed down the stairwell. Okay, Lewis, drop down to "B" deck. "A" deck. - Give me some rope, Captain.\N- "B" deck. Get in there. - Watch the door frame. Watch it.\N- I see it. I got it. We're good. Just chill, boss. Okay, make your turn. - Cable out, Captain.\N- Make your turn. Watch the wall. Brock, we're at the piano. You copy? Copy that. Right there. - That's it. That's the bedroom door.\N- I see it. We're in. We're in, baby. We're there. That's Hockley's bed.\NThat's where the son of a bitch slept. Oops. Somebody left the water running. Hold it. Just a second.\NGo back to the right. That wardrobe door. Get closer. - You're smelling something, boss.\N- I want to see what's under it. Give me my hands, man. All right. - Take it easy. It might come apart.\N- Okay. Okay, go. Flip it over. Go. Turn over. Keep going. Go. Okay, drop it. Oh, baby, baby. Are you seeing this, boss? It's payday, boys. Cha-ching! - We did it, Bobby.\N- We brought it back. Oh, yeah! You the man! Who's the best, baby? Say it. You are, Lewis. - Bobby, my cigar.\N- Right here. Okay, crack her open. Let me get around. Hang on. - You getting it?\N- Got it. Shit. No diamond. You know, boss,\Nthis same thing happened to Geraldo ... and his career never recovered. Turn the camera off. Brock. The partners would like to know\Nhow it's going. Hey, Dave. Barry, hi.\NLook, it wasn't in the safe. Don't worry about it. There are\Nstill plenty of places it could be. Hell, yes. The floor debris in the suite,\Nthe mother's room ... - The purser's safe on "C" deck.\N- Jimmy Hoffa's briefcase. A dozen other places. Guys, look, you just got to trust\Nmy instincts. I know we're close. We just got to go through\Na little process of elimination. Hang on a second. - Let me see that.\N- We might have something here, guys. - Where's the photograph of the necklace?\N- We'll call you right back. I'll be goddamned. Treasure hunter Brock Lovett\Nis best known for finding Spanish gold. It's okay, I'll feed you in a minute. He has chartered Russian subs to reach\Nthe most famous shipwreck of all ... the Titanic. He's with us live via satellite,\Nfrom the research ship Keldysh ... in the North Atlantic. - Hello, Brock.\N- Hello, Tracy. Of course, everyone knows\Nthe familiar stories of Titanic. You know, the nobility of the band\Nplaying to the very end and all that. But what I'm interested in\Nare the untold stories ... the secrets locked deep inside\Nthe hull of Titanic. And we're out here using robot technology\Nto go further into the wreck ... than anybody has ever done before. Your expedition is at the center\Nof a storm ... of controversy over salvage rights,\Nand even ethics. Many are calling you a grave-robber. Nobody ever called the recovery\Nof the artifacts from King Tut's tomb ... - What is it?\N- Turn that up, dear. I have museum-trained experts\Nsent out here making sure ... that these relics are preserved\Nand catalogued properly. Take a look at this drawing\Nthat we found just today. A piece of paper that's been underwater\Nfor 84 years ... and my team are able to preserve it intact. Should this have remained unseen\Nat the bottom of the ocean for eternity? We can see it and ... I'll be goddamned. Brock, there's a satellite call for you. Bobby, we're launching. See these\Nsubmersibles going in the water? Trust me, buddy,\Nyou want to take this call. This better be good. - You got to speak up. She's kind of old.\N- Great. This is Brock Lovett.\NHow can I help you, Mrs. ... Calvert. Rose Calvert. Mrs. Calvert? I was just wondering if you had found\Nthe "Heart of the Ocean" yet, Mr. Lovett. Told you you wanted to take the call. All right, you have my attention, Rose. Can you tell us who the woman\Nin the picture is? Oh, yes. The woman in the picture is me. She's a goddamn liar!\NSome nutcase seeking money or publicity. God only knows why!\NLike that Russian babe, Anesthesia. They're inbound! Rose Dewitt Bukater died on the Titanic\Nwhen she was 17, right? That's right. If she had lived, she'd be over 100 by now. 101 next month. Okay, so she's a very old goddamn liar. Look, I've already done the background\Non this woman ... all the way back to the '20s,\Nwhen she was working as an actress. An actress.\NThere's your first clue, Sherlock. Her name was Rose Dawson back then.\NThen she marries this guy named Calvert. They move to Cedar Rapids\Nand she punches out a couple of kids. Now Calvert's dead, and from what I hear,\NCedar Rapids is dead. And everybody\Nwho knows about the diamond ... is supposed to be dead or on this boat,\Nbut she knows. Doesn't exactly travel light, does she? Hurry up, give him a hand! Mrs. Calvert, I'm Brock Lovett.\NWelcome to the Keldysh. Okay, let's get her inside there. - Hi, Miss Calvert.\N- Hi. - Welcome to the Keldysh.\N- Thanks. Yes? - Are your staterooms all right?\N- Oh, yes, very nice. Have you met my granddaughter, Lizzy?\NShe takes care of me. We met just a few minutes ago.\NRemember, Nana, up on deck? Oh, yeah ... There. That's nice.\NHave to have my pictures when I travel. Can I get you anything?\NIs there anything you'd like? Yes. I would like to see my drawing. Louis XVI wore a fabulous stone\Ncalled the Blue Diamond of the Crown. It disappeared in 1792. About the same time old Louis\Nlost everything from the neck up. The theory goes that the\Ncrown diamond was chopped, too. Re-cut into a heart-like shape that\Nbecame known as the "Heart of the Ocean". Today, it would be worth\Nmore than the Hope Diamond. It was a dreadful, heavy thing.\NI only wore it this once. You actually think this is you, Nana? It is me, dear. Wasn't I a dish? I tracked it down\Nthrough insurance records. An old claim that was settled\Nunder terms of absolute secrecy. Can you tell me\Nwho the claimant was, Rose? I should imagine someone named Hockley. Nathan Hockley. That's right.\NPittsburgh steel tycoon. The claim was for a diamond necklace\Nhis son, Caledon, bought his fiancée, you. A week before he sailed on Titanic. It was filed right after the sinking. So the diamond had to have gone down\Nwith the ship. You see the date? April 14, 1912. Which means if your grandmother\Nis who she says she is ... she was wearing the diamond\Nthe day the Titanic sank. And that makes you my new best friend. These are some of the things\Nwe recovered from your stateroom. This was mine. How extraordinary! And it looks the same as it did\Nthe last time I saw it. The reflection has changed a bit. Are you ready to go back to Titanic? Here we go.\NShe hits the 'berg on the starboard side. She kind of bumps along, punching holes\Nlike Morse code along the side ... below the water line. Then the forward compartments\Nstart to flood. Now, as the water level rises,\Nit spills over the watertight bulkheads ... which, unfortunately,\Ndon't go any higher than "E" deck. So now, as the bow goes down,\Nthe stern rises up, slow at first ... then faster and faster, until finally,\Nshe's got her whole ass sticking in the air. And that's a big ass.\NWe're talking 20,000, 30,000 tons. Okay? And the hull's not designed to deal\Nwith that pressure. So what happens?\NShe splits, right down to the keel ... and the stern falls back level. Then as the bow sinks, it pulls the stern\Nvertical and then finally detaches. Now the stern section kind of bobs there\Nlike a cork for a couple of minutes ... floods, and finally goes under\Nabout 2:20 am ... 2 hours and 40 minutes\Nafter the collision. The bow section planes away,\Nlanding about a ½ a mile away ... going 20, 30 knots\Nwhen it hits the ocean floor. Pretty cool, huh? Thank you for that fine\Nforensic analysis, Mr. Bodine. Of course,\Nthe experience of it was — somewhat different. Will you share it with us? - I'm taking her to rest.\N- No. - Come on, Nana.\N- No! Give me the tape recorder. Tell us, Rose. It's been 84 years. It's okay. Just try to remember\Nanything, anything at all. Do you want to hear this\Nor not, Mr. Lovett? It's been 84 years ... and I can still smell the fresh paint. The china had never been used. The sheets had never been slept in. Titanic was called "The Ship of Dreams". And it was. It really was. All third-class passengers\Nwith a forward berth ... this way, please!\NThis queue! Right here ... - It's a big boat, huh?\N- Daddy, it's a ship. You're right. I don't see what all the fuss is about. It doesn't look any bigger\Nthan the Mauretania. You can be blasé about some things,\NRose, but not about Titanic. It's over 100 feet longer than\NMauretania, and far more luxurious. Your daughter is far too difficult\Nto impress, Ruth. So this is the ship\Nthey say is unsinkable. It is unsinkable.\NGod himself could not sink this ship. Sir, you have to check your baggage\Nthrough the main terminal. It's round that way, sir. I put my faith in you, good sir.\NNow, kindly see my man. Yes, sir. It's my pleasure, sir.\NIf I can do anything at all ... Yes, right. All the trunks from that car there.\N12 from here. And the safe, to the parlor suite,\Nrooms B-52, 54, 56. Ladies, we better hurry. Come along. - My coat?\N- I have it, miss. Queue here for health inspection. All third-class passengers\Nqueue here for health inspection. Chin up. - Welcome aboard, ma'am.\N- Welcome to Titanic. It was the ship of dreams\Nto everyone else. To me, it was a slave ship ... taking me back to America in chains. Outwardly, I was everything\Na well brought up girl should be. Inside, I was screaming. Jack, you are pazzo.\NYou bet everything we have. When you got nothing,\Nyou got nothing to lose. Sven? Bet. All right. Moment of truth.\NSomebody's life is about to change. Brizio? - Niente.\N- Niente. Olaf? Nothing. Sven? 2 pair. I'm sorry, Fabrizio. Che sorry, ma vaffanculo!\NDid you bet all our money? I'm sorry, you're not going to\Nsee your mom again for a long time. 'Cause we're going to America.\NFull house, boys. Come on. I'm going home! - I'm going home.\N- I go to America! No, mate. Titanic go to America, in 5 minutes. Shit, Fabri. Come on. Come on, here. We're riding in high style now.\NWe're a couple of regular swells. We're practically goddamn royalty,\Nragazzo mio. You see? Is my destino. Like I told you,\NI go to America to be millionaire. - You are pazzo.\N- Maybe, but I've got the tickets. - I thought you were fast.\N- Aspetta! Wait! Hey, wait! We're passengers! Passengers! Have you been through\Nthe inspection queue? Of course. Anyway, we don't have any lice.\NWe're Americans, both of us. Right. Come aboard. We're the luckiest sons of bitches\Nin the world. You know that? Goodbye! - You know somebody?\N- Of course not. That's not the point. - Goodbye. I'll miss you.\N- Goodbye! - Goodbye.\N- I will never forget you! Come with me, darling. Let's go. G-60. Excuse me, ma'am. Right here. How you doing? Jack.\NNice to meet you. Jack Dawson. Nice to meet you.\NHow you doing? Who says you get top bunk? This is your private\Npromenade deck, sir. Would you be requiring anything?\NExcuse me. - This one?\N- No. It had a lot of faces on it. This is the one. Would you like all of them out, miss? Yes, we need a little color in this room. Put it in there. In the wardrobe. God, not those finger-paintings again. They certainly were a waste of money. The difference between Cal's taste\Nin art and mine is that I have some. They're fascinating ... like being inside a dream or something. There's truth, but no logic. - What's the artist's name?\N- Something Picasso. Something Picasso. He won't amount\Nto a thing. He won't, trust me. - Put the Degas in the bedroom.\N- At least they were cheap. Put it in the wardrobe. At Cherbourg, a woman came aboard\Nnamed Margaret Brown. We all called her Molly. History would call her\Nthe "Unsinkable Molly Brown". I wasn't about to wait\Nall day for you, sonny. Here, if you think you can manage. Her husband had struck gold,\Nsomeplace out west. And she was what mother called\N"New Money. " By the next afternoon,\Nwe were steaming west ... from the coast of Ireland ... with nothing out ahead of us but ocean. Take her to sea, Mr. Murdoch.\NLet's stretch her legs. Yes, sir. - All ahead full, Mr. Moody.\N- Very good, sir. All ahead full. All ahead full! Come on, lads, step lively. What's the reading? All right! Let's stoke her right up!\NWe go full ahead! Come on, right back to work. 21 knots, sir. Hey, look! See it? There's another one. See him? Look at that one! Look at him jump! I can see the Statue of Liberty already. Very small, of course. I'm the king of the world! She's the largest moving object ever made\Nby the hand of man in all history. And our master shipbuilder, Mr. Andrews,\Nhere, designed her from the keel plates up. I may have knocked her together,\Nbut the idea was Mr. Ismay's. He envisioned a steamer\Nso grand in scale ... and so luxurious in its appointments that\Nits supremacy would never be challenged. And here she is,\Nwilled into solid reality. Hear, hear. The salmon. You know I don't like that, Rose. She knows. We'll both have the lamb.\NRare, with very little mint sauce. You like lamb, right, sweet pea? Sausage. You gonna cut her meat for her,\Ntoo, there, Cal? Hey, who thought of the name Titanic? - Was it you, Bruce?\N- Yes, actually. I wanted to convey sheer size. And size means stability, luxury ... and above all, strength. Do you know of Dr. Freud, Mr. Ismay? His ideas about\Nthe male preoccupation with size ... might be of particular interest to you. What's gotten into you? Excuse me. I do apologize. She's a pistol, Cal.\NHope you can handle her. I may have to start minding\Nwhat she reads from now on ... won't I, Mrs. Brown? Freud, who is he? Is he a passenger? The ship is nice? Yeah, it's an Irish ship. Is English, no? No, it was built in Ireland.\N15,000 Irishmen built this ship. Solid as a rock. Big Irish hands. Well, that's typical. First-class dogs come down here\Nto take a shit. Lets us know where we rank\Nin the scheme of things. Like we could forget. I'm Tommy Ryan. - Jack Dawson.\N- Hello. - Fabrizio.\N- Hi. Do you make any money\Nwith your drawings? Forget it, boyo. You'd as like have angels\Nfly out of your arse ... as get next to the likes of her. I saw my whole life\Nas if I'd already lived it. An endless parade of parties\Nand cotillions ... yachts and polo matches. Always the same narrow people,\Nthe same mindless chatter. I felt like I was standing at\Na great precipice ... with no one to pull me back. No one who cared ... or even noticed. Don't do it. Stay back. Don't come any closer. Come on. Just give me your hand,\NI'll pull you back over. No! Stay where you are. I mean it. I'll let go. No, you won't. What do you mean, no I won't? Don't presume to tell me what I will\Nand will not do. You don't know me. Well, you would have done it already. You're distracting me. Go away. I can't. I'm involved now. You let go, and I'm gonna have\Nto jump in there after you. Don't be absurd. - You'll be killed.\N- I'm a good swimmer. The fall alone will kill you. It would hurt.\NI'm not saying it wouldn't. To tell you the truth,\NI'm a lot more concerned ... about that water being so cold. How cold? Freezing.\NMaybe a couple of degrees over. You ever ...\NYou ever been to Wisconsin? What? They have some of the coldest\Nwinters around. I grew up there, near Chippewa Falls. I remember, when I was a kid,\Nme and my father ... we went ice fishing\Nout on Lake Wissota. - Ice fishing is, you know, where you —\N- I know what ice fishing is. Sorry. You just seem like,\Nyou know, kind of an indoor girl. Anyway, I ... I fell through some thin ice. And I'm telling you ... water that cold ... like right down there ... it hits you like a 1,000 knives\Nstabbing you all over your body. You can't breathe. You can't think. Least, not about anything but the pain. Which is why I'm not looking forward\Nto jumping in there after you. Like I said ... I don't have a choice. I guess I'm kind of hoping you'll\Ncome back over the rail an ... and get me off the hook here. You're crazy. That's what everybody says bu ... but with all due respect, miss ... I'm not the one hanging off\Nthe back of a ship here. Come on. Give me your hand. You don't want to do this. I'm Jack Dawson. Rose Dewitt Bukater. I'll have to get you\Nto write that one down. Come on. I got you. Come on. Come on! Help, please! - Please, help me!\N- Listen to me. I've got you. I won't let go. Now pull yourself up. Come on! Come on. That's right. You can do it. I got you. What's all this? You stand back!\NAnd don't move an inch! Fetch the master-at-arms. This is completely unacceptable. What made you think you could\Nput your hands on my fiancée? Look at me, you filth! - Cal.\N- What do you think you were doing? Cal, stop. It was an accident. An accident? It was. Stupid, really. I was leaning over and I slipped. I was leaning far over to see the ... - Propellers?\N- Propellers, and I slipped. And I would have gone overboard,\Nbut Mr. Dawson here saved me. And almost went over himself. She wanted to see the propellers. Like I said,\Nwomen and machinery do not mix. Was that the way of it? Yeah, that was pretty much it. Well, the boy's a hero, then.\NGood for you, son. Well done. So, it's all's well and\Nback to our brandy, eh?\N- Aha. Look at you. You must be freezing.\NLet's get you inside. Err ... perhaps a little\Nsomething for the boy? Of course. Mr. Lovejoy ... I think a 20 should do it. Is that the going rate\Nfor saving the woman you love? Rose is displeased. What to do? I know. Perhaps you could join us\Nfor dinner tomorrow evening. To regale our group\Nwith your heroic tale. Sure. Count me in. Good. It's settled then. This should be interesting. Can I bum a smoke? You'll want to tie those. It's interesting.\NThe young lady slipped so suddenly ... and you still had time to remove\Nyour jacket and your shoes. I know you've been melancholy. I don't pretend to know why. I intended to save this ... until the engagement gala next week. But I thought, tonight. Good gracious! Perhaps as a reminder\Nof my feelings for you. - Is it a —\N- Diamond? Yes. 56 carats to be exact. It was worn by Louis XVI. And they called it "Le Coeur de la Mer". - The "Heart of the Ocean".\N- The "Heart of the Ocean". Yes. It's overwhelming. It's for royalty. We are royalty, Rose. You know, there is nothing\NI couldn't give you. There is nothing I'd deny you ... if you would not deny me. Open your heart to me, Rose. I've been on my own since I was 15. Since my folks died. And I had no brothers or sisters\Nor close kin in that part of the country. So I lit on out of there\Nand I haven't been back since. You can just call me\Na tumbleweed blowing in the wind. Well, Rose, we've walked\Nabout a mile around this boat deck ... chewed over how great\Nthe weather's been and how I grew up ... but I reckon that's not\Nwhy you came to talk to me, is it? - Mr. Dawson, I —\N- Jack. Jack ... I want to thank you for what you did. Not just for pulling me back ... - but for your discretion.\N- You're welcome. Look ... I know what you must be thinking: "Poor little rich girl.\NWhat does she know about misery?" No. That's not what I was thinking. What I was thinking was ... what could have happened to this girl\Nto make her think she had no way out? Well, I ... It was everything. It was my whole world\Nand all the people in it. And the inertia of my life ... plunging ahead,\Nand me, powerless to stop it. God, look at that thing. You'd have gone straight\Nto the bottom. 500 invitations have gone out. All of Philadelphia society\Nwill be there. And all the while, I feel I'm  ... standing in the middle of\Na crowded room ... screaming at the top of my lungs,\Nand no one even looks up. Do you love him? Pardon me? Do you love him? You're being very rude.\NYou shouldn't be asking me this. It's a simple question.\NDo you love the guy or not? This is not a suitable conversation. Why can't you\Njust answer the question? This is absurd. You don't know me\Nand I don't know you ... and we are not having\Nthis conversation at all. You are rude and uncouth\Nand presumptuous and ... I am leaving now. Jack, Mr. Dawson,\Nit's been a pleasure. I sought you out to thank you\Nand now I have thanked you — And you've insulted me. Well, you deserved it. - Right.\N- Right. - I thought you were leaving.\N- I am. You are so annoying. Wait, I don't have to leave. This is my part of the ship.\NYou leave. Well, well, well!\NNow who's being rude? What is this stupid thing\Nyou're carrying around? So, what are you,\Nan artist or something? These are rather good. They're — they're very good, actually. Jack, this is exquisite work. They didn't think too much\Nof them in old Paree. Paris? You do get around for a ... Well, a person of limited means. Go on, a poor guy. You can say it. Well, well, well. And these were drawn from life? That's one of the good things\Nabout Paris. Lots of girls willing to take\Ntheir clothes off. You liked this woman. You used her several times. Well, she had beautiful hands,\Nyou see? I think you must have had\Na love affair with her. No, no, no, no — just with her hands. She was a one-legged prostitute. See? She had a good sense of humor, though. And this lady ... she used to sit\Nat this bar every night ... wearing every piece of jewelry\Nshe owned just ... waiting for her long lost love. We called her Madame Bijoux. See, her clothes are all moth-eaten. Well, you have a gift, Jack. You do. - You see people.\N- I see you. And? You wouldn't have jumped. But the purpose of university\Nis to find a suitable husband. Rose has already done that. Look, here comes that vulgar\N"Brown" woman. Quickly, get up\Nbefore she sits with us. Hello, girls.\NI was hoping I'd catch you at tea. We're awfully sorry. You missed it. The Countess and I were just off\Nto take the air on the boat deck. What a lovely idea.\NI need to catch up on my gossip. Countess. You've not yet lit\Nthe last 4 boilers? No, I don't see the need. We are making excellent time. The press knows the size of Titanic. Now, I want them to marvel at her speed. We must give them\Nsomething new to print. This maiden voyage of Titanic\Nmust make headlines. Mr. Ismay ... I would prefer not to push the engines\Nuntil they've been properly run in. Of course, I'm just a passenger. I leave it to your good offices\Nto decide what's best. But what a glorious end\Nto your final crossing ... if we were to get into New York\Non Tuesday night and surprise them all. Make the morning papers. Retire with a bang, eh, E.J.? Good man. Well, after that, I worked\Non a squid boat in Monterey, then I went down to Los Angeles\Nto the pier in Santa Monica ... and started doing portraits there\Nfor 10 cents a piece. Why can't I be like you, Jack? Just head out for the horizon\Nwhenever I feel like it. Say we'll go there sometime,\Nto that pier ... even if we only ever\Njust talk about it. No, we'll do it.\NWe'll drink cheap beer, we'll ride on the roller coaster\Ntill we throw up. Then we'll ride horses on the beach,\Nright in the surf. But you'll have to do it like a real\Ncowboy, none of that side-saddle stuff. - You mean, one leg on each side?\N- Yeah. - Can you show me?\N- Sure, if you like. Teach me to ride like a man. And chew tobacco like a man. And spit like a man. What, they didn't teach you that\Nin finishing school? No. Come on, I'll show you. Let's do it. I'll show you how, come on. - Jack, no.\N- Come on. - No. Wait, Jack.\N- Come on. No, Jack. I couldn't possibly, Jack. Watch closely. That's disgusting. All right, your turn. That was pitiful.\NCome on, you really gotta hawk it back. Get some leverage to it,\Nuse your arms ... arc your neck. You see the range on that thing? Okay, go. - That was better. You got to work on it.\N- Really? Really try to hawk it up\Nand get some body to it. You gotta ... Mother. May I introduce Jack Dawson? Charmed, I'm sure. The others were gracious\Nand curious ... about the man who'd saved my life. But my mother looked at him\Nlike an insect. A dangerous insect\Nwhich must be squashed quickly. Jack, sounds like you're a good man\Nto have around in a sticky spot. Why do they always insist on\Nannouncing dinner ... like a damn cavalry charge? Shall we go dress, Mother? See you at dinner, Jack. Son? Son! Do you have the slightest comprehension\Nof what you're doing? Not really. You're about to go into the snake pit. What are you planning to wear? I figured. Come on. I was right. You and my son\Nare just about the same size. Pretty close. You shine up like a new penny. Good evening, sir. There are several thousand tons\Nof Hockley steel in this very ship. - Which part?\N- All the right ones, of course. Then we'll know who to hold accountable\Nif there's a problem. - Where's my daughter?\N- She'll be along. There is the Countess. - Hello, my dear.\N- Good evening, Cal. So good to see you. I saw that in a nickelodeon once\Nand I always wanted to do it. I'll see you at dinner. Darling ... surely you remember Mr. Dawson. Dawson. That's amazing. You could almost pass\Nfor a gentleman. Almost. Extraordinary. My dear, it's delightful to see you. What a remarkable voyage this is. - It's mad, isn't it?\N- Completely lunatic. There's the Countess of Rothes. And that's John Jacob Astor ... the richest man on the ship. His little wifey there, Madeleine,\Nis my age, and in a delicate condition. See how she's trying to hide it? Quite the scandal. And that's Benjamin Guggenheim\Nand his mistress, Madame Aubert. Mrs. Guggenheim is at home\Nwith the children, of course. And over here, we have Sir Cosmo\Nand Lucile, Lady Duff-Gordon. She designs naughty lingerie,\Namong her many talents. Very popular with the royals. Congratulations, Hockley.\NShe's splendid. Why, thank you. - Care to escort a lady to dinner?\N- Certainly. Sweet pea? Ain't nothing to it, is there, Jack?\NRemember, they love money. So just pretend like you own a\Ngold mine and you're in the club. Hey, Astor. Hello, Molly, nice to see you. J.J., Madeleine,\NI'd like you to meet Jack Dawson. - How do you do?\N- Pleasure. Well, Jack ... are you of the Boston Dawsons? No, the Chippewa Falls\NDawsons, actually. Oh, yes. He must have been nervous,\Nbut he never faltered. They assumed he was one of them. Heir to a railroad fortune, perhaps. New money, obviously,\Nbut still a member of the club. Mother, of course,\Ncould always be counted upon. Tell us of the accommodations\Nin steerage, Mr. Dawson. I hear they're quite good\Non this ship. The best I've seen, ma'am.\NHardly any rats. Mr. Dawson is joining us\Nfrom the third class. He was of some assistance\Nto my fiancée last night. It turns out that Mr. Dawson\Nis quite a fine artist. He was kind enough to show me\Nsome of his work today. Rose and I differ somewhat\Nin our definition of fine art. Not to impugn your work, sir. Are these all for me? Just start from the outside\Nand work your way in. He knows every rivet in her,\Ndon't you, Thomas? Your ship is a wonder,\NMr. Andrews. Truly. Thank you, Rose. How do you take your caviar, sir? No caviar for me, thanks. Never did like it much. And where exactly do you live,\NMr. Dawson? Right now, my address\Nis the RMS Titanic. After that, I'm on God's good humor. And how is it you have means to travel? I work my way from place to place. You know, tramp steamers and such. But I won my ticket on Titanic here\Nat a lucky hand at poker. A very lucky hand. All life is a game of luck. A real man makes his own luck,\NArchie. Right, Dawson? And you find that sort of rootless\Nexistence appealing, do you? Yes, ma'am, I do. I mean, I've got everything I need\Nright here with me. I got air in my lungs\Nand a few blank sheets of paper. I love waking up in the morning\Nnot knowing what's gonna happen ... or who I'm gonna meet ... where I'm gonna wind up. Just the other night I was sleeping\Nunder a bridge, and now ... here I am on the grandest\Nship in the world ... having champagne with you fine people. I'll take some more of that. I figure life is a gift\Nand I don't intend on wasting it. You never know what hand\Nyou're gonna get dealt next. You learn to take life\Nas it comes at you. Here you go, Cal. To make each day count. - Well said, Jack.\N- Hear, hear. To making it count. To making it count! Bravo. But Mr. Brown had no idea\NI'd hidden the money in the stove. So he comes home drunk as a pig,\Ncelebrating, and he lights a fire. Bravo. Next it'll be brandies\Nin the smoking room. - Join me in a brandy, gentlemen?\N- What a good idea. Now they retreat into a cloud of smoke\Nand congratulate each other ... on being masters of the universe. Ladies, thank you for the pleasure\Nof your company. Rose, may I escort you to the cabin? No, I'll stay here. Here you go, Molly. Joining us, Dawson? You don't want to stay out here\Nwith the women, do you? - No, thanks, I've got to be heading back.\N- Probably best. It'll be all business and politics,\Nthat sort of thing. Wouldn't interest you. But, Dawson ... good of you to come. Jack, must you go? Time for me to go row\Nwith the other slaves. Good night, Rose. So you want to go to a real party? Is okay if I put my hand here? Okay. What? I can't understand you. I'm going to dance\Nwith her now, all right? Come on. - What?\N- Come on. - Come with me.\N- Jack! Jack, wait. I can't do this. We're gonna have to get\Na little bit closer, like this. You're still my best girl, Cora. - I don't know the steps.\N- Neither do I, just go with it. Don't think. Wait, Jack! Stop! Stop! Wait! Jack, no. ... beyond the jurisdiction\Nof the Sherman Act. So my lawyers will argue. That's what Rockefeller said, but\Nthe Supreme Court is not swallowing it. What? You think a first-class girl\Ncan't drink? Get out of here. You all right? I'm fine. 2 out of 3. So ... you think you're big tough men? Let's see you do this. Hold this for me, Jack. Hold it up. Jesus, Mary and Joseph. - Are you all right?\N- I haven't done that in years. Coffee, sir? I had hoped you would come to me\Nlast night. I was tired. Your exertions below decks were,\Nno doubt, exhausting. I see you had that undertaker\Nof a manservant follow me. How typical. You will never behave like that again,\NRose, do you understand? I'm not a foreman in one of\Nyour mills that you can command. I'm your fiancée. My fiancée! Yes, you are, and my wife! My wife in practice, if not yet\Nby law. So you will honor me. You'll honor me the way a wife\Nis required to honor her husband. Because I will not be made\Nout a fool, Rose. Is this in any way unclear? No. Good. Excuse me. Miss Rose. - We had a little accident.\N- That's all right, Miss Rose. - Sorry, Trudy.\N- It's all right. Let me help you. It's all right, miss. It's all right, miss. - Tea, Trudy.\N- Yes, ma'am. You are not to see that boy again.\NDo you understand me? Rose, I forbid it. Stop it, Mother.\NYou'll give yourself a nosebleed. This is not a game. Our situation is precarious. You know the money's gone. Of course I know it's gone. You remind me every day. Your father left us nothing but a legacy\Nof bad debts hidden by a good name. That name is the only card\Nwe have to play. I don't understand you. It is a fine match with Hockley.\NIt will ensure our survival. How can you put this on my shoulders? Why are you being so selfish? I'm being selfish? Do you want to see me working\Nas a seamstress? Is that what you want? To see our fine things\Nsold at auction? Our memories scattered to the winds? It's so unfair.

No, I'm afraid I don't. - Now, you're gonna have to turn around.\N- He'll tell you. I just need to talk — Mr. Hockley and Mrs. Dewitt Bukater ... continue to be appreciative\Nof your assistance.

Okay, son, wind it up tight\Nlike I showed you. That's right. Okay, now, let it go. That's excellent. Mr. Andrews, forgive me ... I did the sum in my head ... and with the number of lifeboats\Ntimes the capacity you mentioned ... Forgive me, but it seems that there are\Nnot enough for everyone aboard. About half, actually. Rose, you miss nothing, do you? In fact, I put in\Nthese new-type davits ... which can take an extra row of boats\Ninside this one. But it was thought, by some ... the deck would look too cluttered. So, I was overruled. It's a waste of deck space as it is\Nin an unsinkable ship. Sleep soundly, young Rose. I have built you a good ship,\Nstrong and true. She's all the lifeboat you need. Keep heading aft.\NThe next stop will be the engine room. Come on. Jack, this is impossible.\NI can't see you. - I need to talk to you.\N- No, Jack. No. Jack, I'm engaged. I'm marrying Cal. I love Cal. Rose, you're no picnic, all right? You're a spoiled little brat, even. But under that,\Nyou're the most amazingly ... astounding, wonderful girl ... Woman that I've ever known and — - Jack, I —\N- No, let me try to get this out. You're making ... I'm not an idiot.\NI know how the world works. I've got $10 in my pocket. I have nothing to offer you\Nand I know that. I understand. But I'm too involved now. You jump, I jump, remember? I can't turn away without knowing\Nyou'll be all right. That's all that I want. Well, I'm fine. I'll be fine. Really. Really? I don't think so. They have got you trapped, Rose. And you're gonna die\Nif you don't break free. Maybe not right away,\Nbecause you're strong ... but sooner or later, that fire\Nthat I love about you, Rose ... that fire's going to burn out. It's not up to you to save me, Jack. You're right. Only you can do that. I'm going back. Leave me alone. Tell Lucile about the disaster\Nyou had with the stationers. Of course, the invitations had to be\Nsent back, twice. - Oh, my dear.\N- And the dreadful bridesmaids' gowns. Let me tell you,\Nwhat an odyssey that has been. Rose decided she wanted lavender.\NShe knows I detest the color. She did it to spite me. If only you'd come to me sooner. Ruth saw some of my designs\Nin La Mode lllustrée ... they were for the trousseau ... of the Duchess of Marlborough's youngest\Ndaughter. They were quite charming. I think you'll agree, my dear,\Nthat together ... we've created something\Nof a phoenix from the ashes. Hello, Jack. I changed my mind. They said you might be up here — Give me your hand. Now close your eyes. Go on. Now step up. Now hold on to the railing.\NKeep your eyes closed. - Don't peek.\N- I'm not. Step up onto the rail. Hold on. Hold on. Keep your eyes closed. - Do you trust me?\N- I trust you. All right, open your eyes. I'm flying.

Excuse me, his hand,\Nand he's ordering more speed. 26 years of experience working\Nagainst him. He figures anything big enough to sink\Nthe ship, they're gonna see in time to turn. But the ship's too big\Nwith too small a rudder. Doesn't corner worth a damn. Everything he knows is wrong. It's quite proper, I assure you.\NThis is the sitting room. - Will this light do?\N- What? Don't artists need good light? That is true, but I'm not used to working\Nin such horrible conditions. Monet! - You know his work?\N- Of course. Look at his use of color here.\NIsn't he great? I know. It's extraordinary. Cal insists on carting\Nthis hideous thing everywhere. Should we be expecting him\Nanytime soon? Not as long as the cigars\Nand brandy hold out. That's nice. What is it, a sapphire? A diamond. A very rare diamond. Jack, I want you to draw me\Nlike one of your French girls. - Wearing this.\N- All right. Wearing only this. The last thing I need ... is another picture of me\Nlooking like a porcelain doll. As a paying customer ... I expect to get what I want. Over on the bed. The couch. Lie down. - Tell me when it looks right.\N- Put your arm back the way it was. Put that other arm up,\Nthat hand right by your face there. Right. Now, head down. Eyes to me, keep them on me. And try to stay still. So serious. I believe you are blushing,\NMr. Big Artiste. I can't imagine\NMonsieur Monet blushing. He does landscapes. - Just relax your face.\N- Sorry. No laughing. My heart was pounding the whole time. It was the most erotic\Nmoment of my life ... up until then, at least. So what happened next? You mean, did we do it? Sorry to disappoint you, Mr. Bodine. Jack was very professional. Thank you. What are you doing? Will you put this back\Nin the safe for me? - Gentlemen, would you excuse me?\N- Sure. None of the stewards have seen her. This is absurd. It's a ship. There's only so many places\Nshe could be. Lovejoy, find her. - Clear.\N- Yes. I don't think I've ever seen\Nsuch a flat calm. Like a mill pond.\NNot a breath of wind. It will make\Nthe 'bergs harder to see ... with no breaking water at the base. Well, I'm off. Maintain speed and heading,\NMr. Lightoller. Yes, sir. It's getting cold. - You look nice.\N- Miss Rose? My drawings. Come on, Jack! - Wait!\N- Wait! - Go!\N- Take us down, quick. - Go!\N- Quickly! Quickly! Bye. Sorry. - Keep going.\N- Thank you, I've got it. Pretty tough for a valet, this fella. - Seems more like a cop.\N- I think he was. - Oh, shit.\N- Go! - No, over here!\N- Quick! - Now what?\N- What? More coal for number one, mate. What are you two doing down here? You shouldn't be down here.\NIt could be dangerous! Carry on. Don't mind us. You're doing a great job.\NKeep up the good work! Look at what we have here. Thank you. Where to, miss? To the stars. You nervous? No. Put your hands on me, Jack. It's bloody cold. You know, I can smell ice, you know.\NWhen it's near. - Bollocks!\N- Well, I can, all right? Did you ever find those binoculars\Nfor the lookouts? Haven't seen them since Southampton. Well, I'll be on my rounds. Cheerio. You're trembling. Don't worry, I'll be all right. - They ran down there.\N- All right. Anything missing? I've got a better idea. Gotcha! Did you see those guys' faces? Did you see them? When the ship docks ... I'm getting off with you. - This is crazy.\N- I know. It doesn't make any sense. That's why I trust it. Here, look at this. Look at that, would you? They're a bit warmer than we are. If that's what it takes for us\Nto get warm, I'd rather not ... if it's all the same to you, all right? Bugger me! Pick up, you bastards! - Is anyone there?\N- Yes, what do you see? - Iceberg, right ahead!\N- Thank you. Iceberg, right ahead! Hard to starboard! Turn! Smartly! Full astern! - Hard over.\N- Helm's hard over, sir. Go, lads, go! Bring that steam down!\NBring it down! Shut all the dampers! Shut them! Hold it. Now! Engage the reversing engine. Why ain't they turning? - Is it hard over?\N- It is. Yes, sir, hard over. Come on. Come on. Turn. Yes. It's gonna hit! Jesus Christ! Jesus. - Hard to port!\N- Hard to port! Get back! Come on, let's go! Get out of the door.\NThey're closing the doors! Get out! Get out of the door! Go! Come on, lads! Go, lads, go! Out! Oh, my God. That was a close shave, wasn't it? Smell ice, can you? Bleeding Christ! Note the time and enter it in the log. What was that, Mr. Murdoch? An iceberg, sir. I put her hard to starboard, and ran the\Nengines full astern, but it was too close. I tried to port round it, but she hit. - Close the watertight doors.\N- Doors are closed, sir. - All stop.\N- Aye, sir. Find the carpenter.\NGet him to sound the ship. Yes, sir. Come on, let's get the hell\Nout of here. Come on, hurry up. Excuse me,\Nwhy have the engines stopped? - I felt a shudder.\N- I shouldn't worry, madam. We've likely thrown a propeller blade.\NThat's the shudder you felt. May I bring you anything? No, thank you. So, now there's talk of an iceberg.\NDid you see anything? I don't see anything now. Do you? If this is the direction the rats\Nare going, that's good enough for me. Everything's under control. - You there.\N- Sir, there is no emergency. Yes, there is. I've been robbed. Get the master-at-arms. - Now, you moron!\N- Yes, sir. Hey, did I miss the fun? - Did you see what happened?\N- No, I missed it. Apparently, it hit over there. Boiler Room 6 is flooded\N8 feet above the plate ... and the mail hold is worse.\NShe's all buckled in — - Can you shore up?\N- Not unless the pumps get ahead. Have you seen the damage\Nin the mail hold? No, she's already underwater. This is bad. We should tell Mother and Cal. I think they're very good, sir. Don't touch anything.\NI want the entire room photographed. We've been looking for you, miss. Here we go. Something serious has happened. Yes, it has. Indeed. Two things dear to me\Nhave disappeared this evening. Now that one is back, I have a pretty\Ngood idea where to find the other. Search him. - Take your coat off, son.\N- Now what? Come on, now. Cal, what are you doing? We're in the middle of an emergency.\NWhat's going on? - Is this it?\N- That's it. This is horseshit! Don't you believe it, Rose. Don't. - He couldn't have.\N- Of course he could. It's easy enough for a professional. But I was with him the whole time.\NThis is absurd. Perhaps he did it while you were putting\Nyour clothes back on, dear. Real slick, Cal.\NRose, they put it in my pocket. - Shut up.\N- It isn't even your pocket. Is it, son? "Property of A.L. Ryerson." That was reported stolen today. I just borrowed it.\NI was gonna return it. An honest thief.\NWe have an honest thief here, do we? You know I didn't do this, Rose.\NYou know it. Don't believe them, Rose. You know it. - You know I didn't do it.\N- Come on, son. Let's go. - Rose!\N- Come on, there's a good lad. Come on. You know I didn't do it. You know me! This is most unfortunate, Captain. Water 14 feet above the keel\Nin 10 minutes ... in the forepeak, in all 3 holds,\Nand in Boiler Room 6. - That's right, sir.\N- When can we get underway, damn it? That's 5 compartments. She can stay afloat with the\Nfirst 4 compartments breached ... but not 5. Not 5. As she goes down by the head ... the water will spill over the tops\Nof the bulkheads at "E" deck ... from one to the next, back and back. There's no stopping it. The pumps. We open the pumps ... The pumps buy you time,\Nbut minutes only. From this moment,\Nno matter what we do ... Titanic will founder. But this ship can't sink. She's made of iron, sir.\NI assure you, she can. And she will. It is a mathematical certainty. How much time? An hour. Two, at most. And how many aboard, Mr. Murdoch? 2,200 souls on board, sir. Well, I believe you may\Nget your headlines, Mr. Ismay. Oh, it is a little slut, isn't it? You look at me\Nwhen I'm talking to you! - Mr. Hockley?\N- Not now. We're busy. Sir, I've been told to ask you\Nto put on your lifebelts ... and come up to the boat deck.\N- I said, not now. I'm sorry to inconvenience you,\NMr. Hockley, but it's Captain's orders. Now please, dress warmly. It's quite cold out tonight. Now, may I suggest topcoats and hats? This is ridiculous. Not to worry, miss.\NI'm sure it's just a precaution. Everybody up. Lifebelts on. What's he on about? - Everybody up. Put your lifebelts on.\N- What's the ruckus? Just put your lifebelts on. CQD? Sir? That's right, CQD, the distress call. That's our position. Tell whoever responds that we're\Ngoing down by the head ... and need immediate assistance. Blimey. Keep lowering! Steady! Make it taut! And winch out! Uncover this boat!\NUncover all the boats aft! Release those ties! Roll back that cover! Smartly now! Mr. Wilde, where are the passengers? They've all gone back inside.\NToo damn cold and noisy for them. You there! Get down here\Nand help with these lines! Care for a drink, sir? Please put your lifebelts on. Sonny, what's doing? You got us all trussed up here\Nand now we're cooling our heels. Sorry, ma'am. Let me go find out. I don't think anybody knows\Nwhat the hell's going on around here. It's just the goddamned English,\Ndoing everything by the book. There's no need\Nfor language, Mr. Hockley. Go back and turn the heaters on\Nin our rooms. I'd like a cup of tea when I return. - Yes, ma'am.\N- Yes, ma'am. Mr. Andrews ... I saw the iceberg.\NAnd I see it in your eyes. Please tell me the truth. The ship will sink. - You're certain?\N- Yes. In an hour or so ... all this will be\Nat the bottom of the Atlantic. What? Please, tell only who you must. I don't want to be\Nresponsible for a panic. And get to a boat.\NQuickly. Don't wait. You remember\Nwhat I told you about the boats? Yes. I understand. Yes, madam,\Nplease put it on immediately. Over here, son. Sir, they need you up\Nat the second-class purser's office. - There's a big mob up there.\N- Go on. I'll keep an eye on him. Aye. Right. Sir! Carpathia says they're making 17 knots. Full steam for them, sir. She's the only one who's responding? The only one close, sir. Says they can be here in 4 hours. 4 hours! Thank you, Bride. My God. We are swung out and ready, sir. Hadn't we better get the women\Nand children into the boats, sir? Yes. Sir? Women and children first, yes. Yes, sir. Ladies and gentlemen,\Nyour attention, please! Step this way, please. That's right. Come towards me. Thank you. Good. For the time being, I shall\Nrequire only women and children. - Gentlemen, please.\N- Right here. All right, boys. Like the Captain said,\Nnice and cheery, so there's no panic. Wedding Dance. Lifebelts on. Put your lifebelts on. Here, put your lifebelt on. Yeah, come on. Put your lifebelt on. Turn that around. Please. It isn't time to go up to the boats yet! Please stay calm. Make sure, everybody,\Nyou've got your lifebelts on. And, gentlemen, allow the women\Nand children through to the front. - What are we doing, Mommy?\N- We're just waiting, dear. When they finish putting\Nfirst-class people in the boats ... they will be starting with us\Nand we'll want to be all ready, won't we? Everybody, not just right yet. Don't push on the gates.\NYou won't get out any faster. - Someone help.\N- Go and get some help. Lower it away, left and right together! Both sides together! Steady! Steady! Stop! Hold the left side! Right side only! Right side only. Hold the left side! Lower away together! Steady, lads! You know,\NI do believe this ship may sink. I've been asked to give you\Nthis small token of our appreciation. Compliments of Mr. Caledon Hockley. Come on, sister. You heard the man.\NInto the boat. Any room for a gentleman, gentlemen? Only women at this time, sir. Will the lifeboats be seated\Naccording to class? I hope they're not too crowded. Oh, Mother, shut up! Don't you understand? The water is freezing\Nand there aren't enough boats. Not enough by half. Half the people on this ship\Nare going to die. Not the better half. Come on, Ruth, get in the boat.\NFirst-class seats are right up here. You know, it's a pity\NI didn't keep that drawing. It'll be worth a lot more by morning. Women and children\Ntowards the front, please. You unimaginable bastard. Come on, Rose, darling.\NThere's plenty of room for you. Right this way, miss. Come on, Rose. You're next, darling. Come into the boat, Rose. Come. Rose? Get into the boat. Rose? Goodbye, Mother. Rose? - Rose, come back here.\N- Where are you going? To him? What, to be a whore to a gutter rat? No, wait. I'd rather be his whore\Nthan your wife. No! I said, no! Rose, please stop! - Lower away!\N- No, stop! - All together.\N- No, wait! Lower away! Rose! Help! Can anybody hear me? Hello! Help me! Mr. Andrews! - Steward, check the starboard corridor.\N- Yes, Mr. Andrews. Madam, please, put on a lifebelt.\NGet to the boat deck immediately. Lucy, for God's sake, put on\Na lifebelt and set a good example. Yes, sir. - Anyone in here?\N- Mr. Andrews? Thank God. Where would the master-at-arms\Ntake someone under arrest? - You have to get to a boat right away.\N- No! I'm doing this with or\Nwithout your help, sir. But without will take longer. Take the elevator to the very bottom.\NGo to the left. Down the crewmen's passage, then\Ngo right and left again at the stairs. You'll come to a long corridor. This could be bad. Oh, shit! Excuse me. Thank you. - I do not care what you think, sir.\N- Lifts are closed. I'm sorry, miss,\Nbut the lifts are closed. I'm through being polite,\NGod damn it! Now, take me down! "E" deck. Come on. - I'm going back up.\N- No. Come back! I'm going back up! Crew passage. Jack! Rose! Jack! Rose, I'm in here! Jack! - Jack!\N- Rose! Jack! Jack, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. - That guy, Lovejoy, put it in my pocket.\N- I know. I know. Listen, Rose ... you're gonna have to find\Na spare key, all right? Look in that cabinet right there. It's a little silver one, Rose. Silver. These are all brass ones! Check right here, Rose. Rose ... how'd you find out I didn't do it? I didn't.\NI just realized I already knew. Keep looking. No key. There's no key! All right, Rose, listen. You're gonna have to go\Nfind some help. It'll be all right. I'll be right back. I'll just wait here! Hello? Is there anyone here? Hello? Is there anybody down here? We need help! Hello? Damn it. Can anybody hear me, please? Hello? Oh, thank God. Wait, I need your help.\NThere's a man back here. Wait! Hello? Hello? Miss, you shouldn't be here now. - I need your help.\N- We'll get you topside. This way, quickly. There's a man down here. He's trapped. - This way. There is no need to panic.\N- Please! No, I'm not panicking!\NYou're going the wrong way! Let go of me! Listen! The hell with you. Oh, my God. Jack! Rose! Will this work? I guess we'll find out. Come on. Wait. Try a couple\Nof practice swings over there. Good. Now try to hit the same\Nmark again, Rose. You can do it. Okay. That's enough practice. Come on, Rose. You can do it. Listen, just hit it really hard\Nand really fast. Come on. Wait. Open your hands up a little more. - Good.\N- Like that? Right. Listen, Rose, I trust you. Go. You did it! Come on, let's go. Oh, shit, this is cold! This is the way out. We have to find another way.\NCome on. Now there's something\Nyou don't see every day. What's this luggage doing here?\NGet rid of it. We need the room. Get rid of that! Out! Come. Time for her to go, sir.\NStep back. - Keep calm. Sit down.\N- No. - No!\N- Make more room. That's right. Look sharp. Lovejoy. She's not on the starboard side, either. We're running out of time. This strutting martinet\Nisn't letting any men on at all. There's one on the other side\Nletting men on. Then that's our play. We'll need some insurance first.\NCome on. Come on, this way, please.\NAll the way down there. Here! What do you think you're doing? You'll have to pay for that, you know. - That's White Star Line property.\N- Shut up! Will you hold the boat a moment?\NI just have to run back to my room ... - Sit down.\N- She's the last. Mr. Lightoller, why are the boats\Nbeing launched half-full? - Not now, Mr. Andrews.\N- There, look. 20 or so in a boat built for 65? And I saw one boat with only 12. 12! We weren't sure of the weight,\NMr. Andrews. - These boats may buckle.\N- Rubbish! They were tested in Belfast\Nwith the weight of 70 men. Now fill these boats, Mr. Lightoller.\NFor God's sake, man! Please, I need more\Nwomen and children! Get back in there!\NThis is not an exit. Get back in there. You can't keep us locked in here\Nlike animals. The ship's bloody sinking. Bring forward the women. Unlock the gates. Women only! Lock the gates! For God's sake, man, there are\Nwomen and children down here! Let us up, so we can have a chance! Get back! - Jack.\N- Tommy. - Can we get out?\N- It's hopeless that way. Whatever we do,\Nwe've got to do it fast. Jack! Fabrizio. The boats are all gone. This whole place is flooding.\NWe've got to get out. - There is niente this way.\N- All right. Let's go this way,\Nall right? Come on. - I make my own luck.\N- So do I. Come on! No, come on, let's go this way. This way. Just go back to the main stairwell\Nand everything will be sorted out there. The hell it will. It will all get sorted out back there.\NGo back to the main stairwell. - Open the gate.\N- Go back down the main stairwell. Open the gate right now. Go back down the main stairwell\Nlike I told you! God damn it! Son of a bitch! Stop that! Open the damn gate! Fabri, Tommy, give me hand here. - Move aside. Move aside!\N- Pull!

Hurry along. Stand by the falls. God damn it all to hell. Shit. Fire! Sir, you can't go through here. Sir, you can't go through. That's it. Splendid. Right. Prepare to lower! Ready on the left! Take them down. Keep it steady. Both sides together.\NSteady. Keep it steady. - Give her to me.\N- Daddy. - It'll be fine, darling. Don't you worry.\N- Take her. Daddy, get in the boat.

And to you. Mr. Guggenheim? These are for you. No, thank you.\NWe are dressed in our best ... and are prepared to go down\Nas gentlemen. But we would like a brandy. Get the falls over here now!

And he shall dwell with them ... and they shall be his people ... and God himself shall be with them\Nand be their God. Jack ... this is where we first met. And God shall wipe away\Nall the tears from their eyes ... and there shall be no more death ... neither shall there\Nbe sorrow or crying ... neither shall there\Nbe any more pain ... for the former world has passed away. Bloody pull faster! And pull! Hang on, Miss Trudy! Hold on real tight. God almighty! Keep those breakers in! Keep them in! We have to move! Give me your hand, I'll pull you over. Come on, give me your hand. I've got you. I won't let go. Come on, I've got you. - What's happening, Jack?\N- I don't know. - Hold on!\N- Jack! Somebody help me, please! This is it! Oh, my God, Jack! Hold on! The ship is gonna suck us down. Take a deep breath when I say. Kick for the surface and keep kicking. Do not let go of my hand. We're going to make it, Rose. Trust me. I trust you. Ready? Now! Jack! - Rose!\N- Jack! Jack! Jack! Get off her! - Rose!\N- Jack! Swim, Rose! I need you to swim! Keep swimming. - It's so cold.\N- Swim, Rose! Come on. Here. Keep swimming. Come on.

Hold on just a little bit longer. They had to row away\Nfor the suction ... but now they'll be coming back. For God's sake! Please help us! You don't understand. If we go back, they'll swamp the boat.\NThey'll pull us right down, I'm telling you. Knock it off. You're scaring me. Come on, girls, grab an oar. Let's go. Are you out of your mind? We're in\Nthe middle of the North Atlantic. Now, do you people want to live\Nor do you want to die? I don't understand a one of you. What's the matter with you?\NIt's your men out there! There's plenty of room for more. And there'll be one less on this boat. If you don't shut\Nthat hole in your face! Bring in your oars over there. Tie these two boats together as well. Now, make sure that's tied up\Nnice and tight. Right, listen to me, men.\NWe have to go back. I want to transfer all the women\Nfrom this boat into that boat right now. As quick as you can, please. Let's create some space over there.\NMove forward and out. It's getting quiet. It's just going to take a couple of\Nminutes to get the boats organized. I don't know about you ... but I intend to write\Na strongly-worded letter ... to the White Star Line about all this. I love you, Jack. Don't you do that. Don't you say your goodbyes. Not yet. Do you understand me? I'm so cold. Listen, Rose ... you're gonna get out of here. You're gonna go on ... and you're gonna make lots of babies. And you're gonna watch them grow. You're gonna die an old lady,\Nwarm in her bed. Not here. Not this night. Not like this.\NDo you understand me? I can't feel my body. Winning that ticket was the best thing\Nthat ever happened to me. It brought me to you. And I'm thankful for that, Rose. I'm thankful. You must ... do me this honor. You must promise me that you'll survive. That you won't give up ... no matter what happens. No matter how hopeless. Promise me now, Rose. And never let go of that promise. I promise. Never let go. I'll never let go, Jack. I'll never let go. Right ahead, sir. Oars! Do you see any moving? No, sir. None moving, sir. Check them. Bring that oar up here. Check them. Make sure. These are dead, sir. Now give way. Ahead easy. Careful with your oars.\NDon't hit them. Is there anyone alive out there? Can anyone hear me? Is there anyone alive out there? We waited too long. Keep checking them! Keep looking! Is there anyone alive out there? Can anyone hear me? ♪ In my flying machine ♪ ♪ And up she goes ♪ ♪ Up she goes ♪ ♪ Come, Josephine ♪ ♪ In my flying machine ♪ Jack? There's a boat. Jack? There's a boat, Jack. Come back. Come back! Hello! Can anyone hear me? There's nothing here, sir. Come back. I'll never let go. I promise. Come about! 1,500 people went into the sea ... when Titanic sank from under us. There were 20 boats floating nearby ... and only one came back. One. 6 were saved from the water ... myself included. 6 out of 1,500. Afterward,\Nthe 700 people in the boats ... had nothing to do but wait. Wait to die, wait to live. Wait for an absolution ... that would never come. Sir, I don't think you'll find\Nany of your people down here. It's all steerage. His hair is reddish brown,\Nand a white beard. - Isn't there another passenger list?\N- There's no other list. - Perhaps he's on another ship.\N- We're doing all we can. That's the last time I ever saw him. He married, of course,\Nand inherited his millions. But the crash of '29\Nhit his interests hard. And he put a pistol\Nin his mouth that year. Or so I read. Can I take your name, please, love? Dawson. Rose Dawson. Thank you. We never found anything on Jack.\NThere's no record of him at all. No, there wouldn't be, would there? And I've never spoken of him\Nuntil now. Not to anyone. Not even your grandfather. A woman's heart\Nis a deep ocean of secrets. But now you know there was a\Nman named Jack Dawson ... and that he saved me ... in every way\Nthat a person can be saved. I don't even have a picture of him. He exists now only in my memory. Keldysh, Mir-2 on our way\Nto the surface. I was saving this\Nfor when I found the diamond. I'm sorry. 3 years. I've thought of nothing\Nexcept Titanic. But I never got it.
