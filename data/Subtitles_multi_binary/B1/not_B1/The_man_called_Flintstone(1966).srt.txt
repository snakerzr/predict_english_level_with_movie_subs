That is our parachute? Hee hee! Hee hee hee!\NHee hee! Hee hee! Some parachute. Oh, shut up, you! [Angry muttering] [Crash] Ho ho! We have him trapped! Good.\NLet's squish him. ALI: Hurry, hurry!\NHe must not escape! He won't.\NWe've got him now. [Panting] [Giggles] [Chuckles] [Both laughing] That's the end\Nof Rock Slag. Nice work, Bobo. Thank you, Ali. Ho ho! Ho ho!\NHo ho! Ho ho! [Chuckles] They think they've\Nfinished me off. They don't know how tough\Nwe secret agents are. This is Secret Agent\NRock Slag reporting\Nto Chief Boulder. Come in, Chief. This is Chief Boulder.\NAnything wrong, Slag? Plenty. Ali and Bobo, 2 of the Green Goose's\Nstrong-arm boys, got me cornered and\Ntried to do me in. Are you OK, Slag? Well, I think\NI've twisted my tibia, and cracked\Nmy clavicle, Chief. Stay there, Slag. I'll get an ambulance\Nto you right away. Right, Chief. Cracked clavicle--\Nthat's a bad break, just as we were closing in\Non the Green Goose and his nefarious\NSMIRK organization. The whole world is\Nin peril as long as the Green Goose is loose. Operator, get me\Nthe Bedrock Hospital. Oh, Wilma!\NWe're gonna leave now. WILMA: OK, Fred. But please hurry. We still have\Na lot of packing to do. Be back right after\Nwe take Dino and Hoppy to, uh, you know where. I don't envy the boys. Dino and Hoppy always\Nput up such a fuss when they go to the vet's. It's a shame we can't\Ntake them with us. I'm gonna miss Hoppy. I'm gonna miss Dino, too. But a camping vacation\Nis bad enough without dragging\Npets along. How true. Seems like there's a million\Nand one things to do when you're going\Non a trip, huh, Barney? Yeah. We darn near forgot\Nto take Dino and Hoppy to-- Don't say it, Barn! Oops, I almost\Ngave it away. Watch it. If those 2 knew\Nwe were gonna leave 'em\Nat the v-e-t-s, for 2 weeks they'd\Ntake to the woods. Well, uh, how we gonna\Nget 'em in the office, Fred? We'll sneak up\Nthe back alley. They've never been\Ntaken inside that way before. Hey, that's a good idea.\N[Laughs] Come on, Dino. We gotta see a man\Nabout something. BARNEY: Uh, yeah,\Nyou, too, Hoppy. DINO: Yipe!\N[Barking] FRED: No!\NNo, Dino, no! Hold it! Hold it! Whoa, whoa, whoa! [Hoppy honking] BARNEY:\NTake it easy, Hoppy! Take it easy,\Ncalm down now! Dino,\Ncome back here! Come-- Look out, Fred,\Ncomin' through! Oops! Oh, boy. Mr Flintstone!\NMr Rubble! You're going\Nabout it all wrong. You have to use psychology. Psychology? What do\Nyou mean, Doc? I'll show you. Miss Soapstone, send Zsa Zsa and Dolly\Nout here. Yes, sir. Who is Zsa Zsa? And Dolly? Zsa Zsa is\Na girl hoparoo, and Dolly is\Na girl dinosaur. Watch this. [Honking] [Barking] [Honks] [Barks] [Honking and barking] [Laughs] I gotta\Nhand it to you, Doc. You sure know\Nyour psychology. Doesn't he, Barn? Barney? Woo, woo, woo,\Nwoo, woo, woo! FRED: Barney! Uh, huh? What? Oh, boy. Thanks, Fred. That psychology stuff\Nwas working on me, too. [Both Laughing] I hope the girls\Nhave everything packed. I'm anxious\Nto get started. Me, too. Hey, where you\Ngoing, Fred? This is the way\Nto Rock Canyon Road. Right, Barn. We'll save 10 minutes\Ngoing home this way. But Rock Canyon Road\Nis closed. It's too dangerous! Not for a good\Ndriver like me. Hold on, Barn,\Nhere we are. We ought to have\Nseat belts, Fred! Oh, who needs 'em? There, we're down. How is that\Nfor skilful driving? Oh, my goodness, Fred! Are you all right? Oh--\NOh, my head! Boy, that's some bump. Ooh! Hey, we'd better\Nget you to a doctor. FRED: No, that's\Nnot necessary. Oh, I don't know, Fred. It won't hurt to have\Nyour head examined. BARNEY: Here we are...\NThe Bedrock Hospital. It'll only take a minute. You wait here,\NI'll go find a doctor. Make it snappy,\Nwill ya? I feel OK now. Uh, pardon me, Nurse. My friend needs\Nto see a doctor. You'll have to wait. All the doctors are\Nbusy with a patient who fell off a roof\Nlast night. Fell off a roof?\NIs he hurt? I'll say. They've been working\Non him all night. FIRST DOCTOR: Hold it. You've got his head\Non backwards. SECOND DOCTOR:\NWell, twist it around. OK, that's enough. Now, cut! How are you doing,\NIrving? Be finished in a minute. Nurse! [Clanking] There, we've finished. The statue\Nlooks just like new. When the cement dries,\Nhe can go back on the roof. How about the man\Nwho fell with him? How's he doing? Not bad. Dr Moonstone\Nis taking care of him. Dr Moonstone,\NI'm Chief Boulder, head of this country's\NSecret Service. And your patient\Nis Rock Slag, my best agent. Thanks, Chief. CHIEF: Doc, you must get Rock\Nback on his feet quickly. He's the only agent\NI have capable of carrying out\Na very important and dangerous\Nmission. Rock Slag survive fall. He is still alive, Bobo. Our work is\Nnot done, Ali. Mr Slag can\Nleave any time. He just bruised\Na few ribs. So, now if you'll\Nexcuse me, I'll just look in\Non my other patients. Sure, Doc, sure.\NAnd, uh, thanks. That's great news. What's this important\Nmission, Chief? The biggest yet. You're going\Nto eliminate the guy that tried\Nto eliminate you. ROCK: You mean\Nthe Green Goose. Yes! Intelligence reports\Nhe has a weapon so powerful he could\Ndestroy the world. And probably will,\Nunless-- NURSE: Rock Slag! Ooh! [Growls] Mmm! [Giggles] Unless\Nhe is stopped. So you see, Slag, the safety of every man,\Nwoman, and child in every country\Ndepends on you. On me? Why me, Chief? CHIEF: It has\Nto be you, Rock Slag. Rock Slag!\NYum, yum, yum! Mmm! [Squeals and giggles] There's your answer. You have an uncontrollable\Nappeal to women. Yes, I know. But how can\Nthat help us, Chief? CHIEF: We're going to put\Nyour gift to good use. How, Chief? Through Tanya, the Green Goose's\Nnumber one lieutenant. She's heard\Nabout you, Rock. And she wants\Nto meet you so badly, she's made a deal\Nwith us to turn the Green Goose\Nover to you! To me? That's the deal. You're going\Nto meet her in Paris. When do I leave, Chief? At once.\NI'll call the office and have them get\Nyour plane ticket. At last,\NRock Slag is alone! Now we can finish\Nthe job. ALI: Hello, Rock Slag. Ali! Bobo! You're taking\Na trip, Slag. A one-way trip, huh? Hee hee! Hee hee\Nhee! Hee hee! This time we got him, Ali. Rock Slag is\Nfinished, Bobo! Hee hee! Hee hee\Nhee! Hee hee! Ho ho! Ho ho!\NHee hee! Hee hee! With Rock back on the job,\Nthe Green Goose's goose is as good as cooked\Nright now. Rock! What happened? While you were gone\NI had visitors, Chief. Ali and Bobo? Right. The goon twins. CHIEF: Well,\Nthat does it. Tanya will never\Ngo for you. You're a mess! That cooks\Nour Green Goose. I'll try\Nto heal fast, Chief. It won't be\Nfast enough, Rock. At any moment,\Nthe Green Goose may decide to take over the world. I'd better cancel\Nyour trip to Paris. Is this the patient? Uh, yeah, Doc.\NFred Flintstone. He fell on his head. I'm OK now, Doc.\NI feel fine. Well, why don't we\Ncheck you over anyway? Come with me,\NMr Flintstone. OK, but I'm telling you,\Nit's a waste of time. Hmm. Your pulse seems\Nto be normal. Right on the button,\Nin fact. Now cross your legs, and we'll test\Nyour reflexes. Make it snappy,\Nwill ya, Doc? I'm on my vacation. We're almost finished. Reflex is normal. [Mumbling] You can leave now,\NMr Flintstone. Right after I give you\Na booster shot. Best to play it safe,\Nyou know. Yeah, yeah,\Nyeah, all right. Let's have the shot, Doc.\NI wanna get out of here. DOCTOR: You won't even\Nfeel this, Mr Flintstone. FRED: Yeow!\NWatch it, Doc! What are you\Ntrying to do, put me\Nin the hospital? It's amazing! That man is a dead ringer\Nfor Rock Slag! Look at the size\Nof this needle. What do you think I am,\Na brontosaurus? Why, he could be\NRock's twin! His twin!\NI wonder if-- Why not?\NIt's worth a try. Pardon me, sir. Can I have a word\Nwith you? Who, me? CHIEF: Yes. Your country\Nneeds you. My country needsme?! Now, let's see\Nif i got this straight. The government will\Nsend me and my family to Paris to pick up\Na Green Goose because I look\Nlike this guy? Right, Mr Flintstone. Your resemblance\Nto our regular messenger is fantastic! And as you can see, he's in no condition\Nto make the trip. FRED: Yeah,\NI can see that. This Green Goose\Nmust be a very valuable\Nbird. Very valuable. Our government wants\Nto put him in a cage. I had planned a camping\Ntrip this year, but, uh, you did say\N"all expenses paid"? Every last penny. In that case, I'll be\Nglad to help the government get the Green Goose. CHIEF: Good. Now, raise\Nyour right hand. My right hand? And repeat after me. OK. I will not reveal\Nmy mission to anyone. I will not reveal\Nmy mission to anyone. Not even my wife. Not even my...\Nwife?! Congratulations. You are now an official\Nsecret agent. Gosh! [Laughs] A spy-type guy.

Why that guy is no match for the Green Goose\Nand his gang! I know. But he's\Nour only chance. Besides, I'll be there\Nto keep an eye on him. You'd better, or that Flintstone will be in worse shape than I am! It's a long shot, but he just may\Nbe able to pull it off. FRED: Hiya, Barney. Fred! Gee, I thought\Nyou'd never come out. What did the doc\Nhave to say? I'm OK, but I got\Nto cancel the camping trip. Cancel the camping trip! Oh! There he is! Who? Who?\NRock Slag! Rock Slag? Ooh! You naughty boy! Trying to leave\Nwithout good-bye! [Kissing and giggling] Wow! What a hospital plan\Nthey have here. I don't get it! Now, tell me, Fred. How come you gotta\Ncancel our camping trip?

Quick, after him! Here he comes. We must not fail\Nthis time. Boy, this is\Na rough road! You're not kidding. When I give\Nthe signal, you push the rock. BO: Right!\NPush the rock.

No, thanks.\NI have a tie. Shaving lotion,\Nnail clippers, hubcaps,\Nfountain pens, a gold watch? I don't need anything. Then how about something\Nfor the little lady, like a genuine imitation\Ndiamond necklace, maybe? A diamond necklace? Are you sure it's a real\Ngenuine imitation diamond necklace? I guarantee it. Wow! How much? Would you consider\Na dollar and a quarter? 75 cents? It's yours\Nfor 2 bits, bud. I don't know if this'll\Nsquare me with Wilma, but it's worth a try.

Nothin' doin'! Too dangerous! I got a family\Nto think of-- Pebbles' future! If we don't stop\Nthe Green Goose, Pebbles won't have\Na future. Sorry, Chief. You'll have to get\Nsomebody else.

I knew you'd change\Nyour mind, Flintstone. You're A-OK. Are you sure this\Nis the right girl? Absolutely. You're having lunch\Nwith her at Papa Piccolo's\NPizza Palace. Here we are, Flintstone.\NLet's go inside. There she is. Tanya. The girl\Nwho will lead us to the Green Goose's\Nhideout. Rrr! She's a doll. Your job will be simpler\Nthan we thought, Flintstone. Rock Slag has recovered\Nand will be here within a hour. All you have to do is keep\NTanya here until he arrives. Think you can do it? It'll be a cinch. I'll order everything\Non the menu. Wait. I want you to wear\Nthis recorder. Recorder? Yes. We wanna take down\Neverything Tanya says. I'm glad I had\Nmy beak sharpened. Tanya may be\Na real yacker. This flower\Nis the microphone. And remember,\Nkeep her talking until the real Rock Slag\Ntakes over. Gotcha, Chief. BETTY:\NOh, how exciting! The famous Papa Piccolo's\NPizza Palace. Let's go in\Nand have some lunch. Poor Fred. It's a shame\Nhe isn't here. Fifty flying\Nfirefighters? Mmm... Bubala! Ha ha ha.\NHello, Tanya. Rock Slag.\NAt last we meet. May I sit down? Is that wise?\NWe should leave at once. Oh, plenty of time. Let's have\Na little talk first about, uh...\Nyou know who. Oh, the Green Goose.\NHe's a terrible man! Do you know\Nhe has a secret weapon more powerful\Nthan any? A little louder, please, and speak into\Nthe flower. How cute. I will\Nwear it in my hair. No, no, no. Allow me to get you\Na fresh flower. I'll be right back. Toodle-oo! Fred! Wilma! What are you\Ndoing here? And who are you\Nwaving at? Wa-wa-waving?\NWho--who's waving? Oh, that! Ha ha ha! It's just a loose wrist. I thought you had some unfinished business\Nto take care of. Well, I do.\NThat is, I finished. I took a chance\Nyou might be here, so...ha ha...\Nhere I am. Oh, how nice! Well, sit down,\NFred. Yeah!\NJoin the party. Huh? Oh, yeah. yeah. Will you excuse me\Na minute? It's kinda drafty\Nin here. I'll go close\Nthe window. Sorry. I couldn't\Nfind a flower. Oh, that's all right. It's kinda drafty\Nin here. I'll go close\Nthe window. Excuse me. What took you\Nso long, dear? I was stuck.\NI mean the window was stuck. Well,\Nshould we order? Yeah. Good idea. Uh-oh. Excuse me! Tanya, what are you\Ndoing? Getting my wrap.\NWe must leave! Look, t-the orchestra's\Ngettin' ready to play. Let's dance. Well...maybe just\Nonce. [Slow song starts] I'd sure like\Nto dance. I wonder where Fred is. Uh-oh. What are you doing,\NRock? In this business,\Nyou can't be too careful. [Upbeat song starts] It's Fred! I didn't know you\Nwanted to dance, honey. Wilma! Uh-oh! Oh, you dance divinely,\Ndarling. So do you, dear. Dear?\NDarling? Come on, Tiger.\NLet's get out of here. Tiger? So that's it! That's your\Nunfinished business. L-l-look, Wilma, I--I can explain\Neverything. I wish you would. I've been going crazy down there\Ntrying to record it. There's nothing\Nto explain. It's all\Nvery obvious! Wilma, please,\Nwon't ya listen? I'm going home...Tiger! Hey, Flintstone. Rock Slag's cab\Nis arriving. Go get Tanya. You can switch with Slag\Nin the lobby. Hurry! Taxi! Allow me, madame. Don't you get smart\Nwith me, Fred Flintstone! So we see you in your\Ntrue colours, you playboy! How could you do that\Nto the mother of your child? Consider our friendship\Nended! You playboy! Rock! Oh, no,\Nnot again. You powder your nose,\NTanya. I'll wait for ya\Nin the lobby. All set, Chief.\NWhere's Rock? Right there. What happened? He must have had\Na relapse. Look! Rock Slag! Quick, upstairs! Looks like you're going\Nto have to carry the ball a little longer, Flintstone. Me? I gotta go home and\Nsquare myself with Wilma! No time for that now! I just got this message.\NListen. "Green Goose\Nsecret weapon "is giant inter-rockinental\Nmissile. our anti-missile missile\Nis not operational yet." So you see, it's up to us\Nto stop the Green Goose! Us? What do you mean\Nus? You go with Tanya\Nto the Green Goose's hideout. I'll phone Triple X, and we'll follow\Nright behind you. Now just a minute. That wasn't the deal-- I'm ready, Rock.\NLet's go. But--but--but--but---\NOh, boy. Hello, operator? Hello, hello? Operator, are you there? [Crash] Hee hee! Hee hee!\NHee hee hee hee! Right on target,\NBobo. Thanks, Ali. Now we get Rock Slag. No time. First we must\Ntake message to Green Goose. Good idea, Ali. Green Goose will be proud\Nof us. Bwa ha ha ha! Here we are, Rock. The Green Goose's\Nsecret headquarters. An abandoned\Namusement park. Pretty clever. OK, Rock. Now what? Follow me. Follow me, Chief,\Nwherever you are. Why do you keep\Nlooking behind you? Oh, I just wanted\Nto make sure we were being\Nfollowed. I mean...we'renotbeing followed. Heh heh heh. Eh... The Green Goose\Nis in there. I'll go in first\Nand get behind him. Then when you come in, I will drop this rope\Nover him. Count to 5\Nbefore you break in. OK. 1...2... 3...4... 5. Let's go, Chief! We're movin' in! All right, Goose!\NYou're cooked! Ah...Mr Slag! Nice of you to drop in. Shall I tie him up? That won't be necessary. Ferocious\Nwouldn't like it if Mr Slag\Ntried to leave. Would you, Ferocious? [Growls] Hey, what is this?\NWhat's goin' on, Tanya? My dear Rock, the Green Goose\Nneeds some information. So we set up\Nthis little trap for you. Surprised? A double cross, huh? Well, now I have\Na surprise for you! OK, Chief, come in! Oh, uh,\Nthere you are. Barney! Yeah, Barney.\NI followed you here. I'm not leaving until\NI get some information! Exactly what I was saying. Hey, who are you,\Nbuster? And why are you\Nwearing this-- [Rrr] Eh, ahem, look, Goose, this guy is just\Na friend of mine. Why don't you\Nlet him go? Oh, come now, Mr Slag, you know that's impossible! Mr Slag? Who's that? That's me.\NI'll explain later. GOOSE: Slag? I know your government has been working on\Nan anti-missile missile. I want to know\Nif they have completed it. I don't know anything\Nabout it. GOOSE: I'd advise you\Nto cooperate. I'd hate to resort\Nto using unpleasant methods. [Grrr] Unpleasant methods? What's going on? This guy is\Na master criminal and I'm helping\Nthe government capture him. But don't worry. Our agents will\Nbust in any minute. You don't scare me,\NGoose. No? What about your\Nchubby friend? Uh-oh. I, uh... I just rembered\NI--I double parked outside. I'll be right back. Ferocious! [Grrr] [Grrr--grrr-grrr] [Evil laughter] Oh, oh, oh! Oh! GOOSE: Not yet, Ferocious. I may need him. Tanya! Show them\Nthe torture chamber! [Creak] These are some\Nof my toys, but I want you to see\Nmy latest one. It's called\Nanerocktric chair. We strap you in and... Quite effective,\Nisn't it? Ab-bout my car. I--I left my lights\Non, too. Can I turn 'em off? Take it easy, Barn. Help will be here\Nany second. You'll get nothin'\Nout of me, Green Goose! I knew it would be useless\Nto even try withyou, Slag, but your chubby\Nlittle friend is another story,\Nisn't he? Heh heh heh. Tanya, the rack! FRED: Hey! Hey! What are you doin'\Nto Barney?! Perhaps when you see what\Nhappens to your friend you'll tell me what\NI want to know. Yeow! You can't intimidate me\Nwith these crude methods. I'm intimi-nated! Yeow! Talk, Slag. Never! BARNEY: Yeow! Talk! No! BARNEY: Yeow! Don't worry, Barn. All we gotta do is\Nstall him a little longer. My lips are sealed, Goose! BARNEY: Yeow! Slag, you're\Nsuperhuman. I've never met\Nanyone like you. Zounds! How much pain\Ncan a man stand? All you can dish out\Nand more. BARNEY: Yeow! Don't worry, Barney.\NI can take it. You ain't takin' it.\NI am! You're gonna come outta this\Nabig man! And a thin one, too! [Knock, knock] At last! It's about time. I was beginnin'\Nto think you wouldn't\Nshow up. Chief? If you're expecting\NChief Boulder, he's out-- out cold for the evening. That's right. And we found\Nthis message on him. Hmm... "Green Goose\Nsecret weapon "is giant\Ninter-rockinental missile. our anti-missile missile\Nis not operational yet." Ha ha ha ha! Good work, Ali. Release the prisoner, Tanya. I have the information\NI need. Lock those two up\Nand prepare to launch missile. Nobody can stop me now! Mwa ha ha ha ha\Nha ha ha ha ha! So that's the way\Nit was, Barney. Just because I happen\Nto look like Rock Slag, I got the plane tickets,\Nmoney, everything, and I also got you\Ninto this mess-- my best friend. Well, uh,\Ncould be worse, Fred. At least Betty and Wilma\Nand the kids are OK. Yeah. I wonder if we'll\Never see 'em again. Hey, Slag! Chowtime! Hee hee! Hee hee!\NHee hee hee hee! Oh, boy, food. Oh, I'm starved. [Slurp] Fred: Barney!\NDon't eat that stuff! I couldn't\Nif I wanted to, Fred. No spoon. Looks like\Nthe Green Goose is tryin' to get rid\Nof us, Barney. We've gotta get outta\Nhere and find that missile. Oh, I wonder\Nwhere it could be. Enh heh heh\Nheh heh heh heh! The Fun House. I hope our guests are\Nenjoying their last moments. This amusement park is the perfect\Nlaunching spot. Who would think\Nthat the space ride isreallya deadly missile? No one. Now, let's prepare\Nto launch. Hey--hey, Fred, you sure you know\Nwhat you're doin'? This tower\Nis 100-feet high, and you've got\Nan awful short tie. Don't worry.\NWe'll make it. Oh, e-easy, Fred. Howya doin', Barn?

What are you\Ncomplain' about? That was my best tie\Nyou ruined. Oh, sorry, Fred. Guess we never\Nwill get outta here. Hey, Barney, look. What is it? The guards-- They're asleep, and the key\Nis hangin' on the desk. So what good\Ndoes that-- Shh! Quiet. Oh, uh, sorry, Fred, but, uh, how are we\Ngonna get the key? [WHISPERING] That's what\Nwe gotta figure out. Hey, would you mind\Nspeakin' a little louder? I can't hear a word\Nyou're saying. Well, whaddya know? The tape recorder. How would you like to\Ndo us a little favour? What kind of\Na little favour? Oh, nothin' much.\NYou see that key? What about it? Just fly over there and bring it back\Nto me. Unh-uh. I'm a recorder,\Nnot a retriever. But you've got to. It's our only chance\Nto get outta here. All right, All right,\Nsimmer down. I'll give it a try. Shh! Turn around. Whoops! Oh, no! Sorry, it slipped. But don't worry.\NI'll get it. Just put me down and relax. What's he gonna do,\NFred? Beats me. RECORDER:\NWhoa! I'm hurt! The old wing is shot. Woe is me! I can't fly anymore.

Barney, I got it!\NI got the key! I just hope the union\Nnever hears about this. [Muffled yells] Hold it, Barney. That door might lead\Nto a trap. You better\Nlet me check first. OK, Fred. It's OK, Barn. Come on. Barney, where are you? Let me go! Let me go! Take it easy, Rock. It's only me,\NTriple X. Oh, boy, am I glad\Nto see you. Where ya been?\NWhat took you so long?

Then you're--\Nyou're the Green Goose. And you're a dead duck. Ali, Bobo, over here! Oh, no, you don't! Come back, you! Never mind! I'm going to\Nfire the missile. Come on. Hee hee! Hee hee hee!\NHee hee! Hee hee! Ha ha ha! BO: Oh, boy!\NBig fireworks. ALI: Whole world\Ngo boom! Hee hee! Hee hee hee!\NHee hee! Hee hee! The missile.\NI gotta stop 'em! I wonder where Barney is.

There's no time to lose. [Green Goose cackles] This is the big moment,\Ngentlemen. First, I set\Nthe directional control. Then I set\Nthe firing pin. When the countdown\Nreaches zero, The blade will snap back,\Ncut the rope, and the missile\Nwill take off. Oh, Goose,\Nyou are a genius. Oh, you are so right. In a matter of minutes, the whole world\Nwill know of my power, and I alone shall rule\Nsupreme. [Buzz] Ah ha ha ha ha ha! We've got to find\Nthat missile, Barney. It's all up to us now. Hey, Fred, look--\NThe Green Goose. Hold on, Barney!\NWe're crashin' through. Stop them, Bobo! Right. Ahh...Mr Slag,\NWe meet again. But too late\Nfor you to stop me! Run, Barney! Run!

Our friends have\Ntrapped themselves in the missile. Well, we no longer\Nneed concern ourselves with them. Hey, didya hear that,\NFred? Yeah, Barney.\NWe found the missile. Well--well,\Nwhat can we do? Nothin' to save ourselves, but we can aim the missile\Ninto space, where it won't do any harm. At least that's somethin'. Oh, boy. Payload in an interplanetary\Nprojectile. Oh! What a way\Nto go! They say we all gotta go\Nsometime, Barn. Too bad I'll\Nnever get the chance to give Wilma\Nthis present. Wow, Fred,\Nwhere'd you get that? BARNEY: It must\Nbe worth millions! Huh? Nah. No, it's\Nonly worth, uh... uh... It's only worthone million. Just think, Barney-- we'll be the richest guys\Nin space. A million! Slag! Heh heh heh! I'll make a deal\Nwith you. I'll swap you\Nyour lives for that\Nnecklace. On your toes, Barn. It's a deal. [Buzz] Hand it out. Here you are! [Crash]\N[Thud] Yii! Ali!
