There it is,\Nright there on the desk. - Where's she headed?\N- She's snowbound, Ramon. - See you went with the pink.\N- Yeah, yeah. It's kind of a pink day today. I'm gonna have another pickup\Nfor you on Thursday. - All right. We'll see you then.\N- All right. Thanks, Ramon. Peterson! Peterson! Peterson. - Mr. Cowboy, da?\N- Da. Mmm, it's pretty. Mmm. It's from my wife. Time... rules over us without mercy... not caring if we're healthy or ill,\Nhungry or drunk... Russian, American,\Nbeings from Mars. It's like a fire.\NIt could either destroy us or keep us warm. That's why every FedEx office\Nhas a clock. Because we live or we die\Nby the clock. We never turn our back on it. And we never, ever\Nallow ourselves... the sin of losing track\Nof time! Locally, it's 1:56. That means we've got\Nthree hours and four minutes... before the end-of-the-day's\Npackage sort. That's how long we have.\NThat's how much time we have... before this pulsating, accursed,\Nrelentless taskmaster... tries to put us\Nout of business. Hey, Nicolai. Hey.\NNicolai, good to see you. How are you, kid?\NLook what you did. You just delivered\Nyour very first FedEx package. That deserves something special,\Nlike a Snickers bar... and a C.D. player. And something to listen to...\Na C.D. There. Elvis Presley. Fifty million fans\Ncan't be wrong. You all recognize this,\Ndon't you? I took the liberty\Nof sending this to myself. I FedEx'd it\Nbefore I left Memphis. You're probably wondering\Nwhat could be in here. What could it possibly be?\NIs it architectural plans? Maybe technical drawings? Is this the new wallpaper\Nfor the... for the bathroom? It is... a clock... which I started\Nat absolute zero... and is now at 87 hours,\N22 minutes and 17 seconds. From Memphis, America\Nto Nicolai in Russia, 87 hours. Eighty-seven hours\Nis a shameful outrage. This is just an egg timer! What if it had been something else?\NLike your paycheck? Or fresh boysenberries?\NOr adoption papers? Eighty-seven hours\Nis an eternity. The cosmos was created\Nin less time! Wars have been fought and\Nnations toppled in 87 hours! Fortunes made and squandered. What? What are you saying about me? I tell them,\Nwhat do they expect? This man, when his truck broke down, he\Nstole a boy's bicycle to do his delivery. I borrowed it!\NI borrowed a kid's bike. And I got my packages\Ndelivered, and that is what you people are gonna\Nhave to start doing. You have to start doing whatever it takes,\Nbecause in three hours and two minutes... every one of these packages\Nhas to be on the big truck... and on its way to the airport. Fifteen minutes! - Crunch time! Crunch time!\N- Crunch time! Let's go! Every package\Non the airport truck. Go! Crunch, crunch, crunch! - We have a big problem.\N- What? - The truck in Red Square is stuck.\N- What do you mean? - It's stuck.\N- Stuck how? In snow? In ice? It's stuck! The most important truck...\Nthe Kremlin truck! Many packages. All right, all right, all right.\NLet's put the table right here. We'll just do the sort. Ah, yeah, a clamp.\NThat would make us stuck. Let's go. Unload...\NGet him out of there. Right here.\NTwo lines, two lines. One to the airport truck,\None to the Moscow truck. Got it? C.D.G., F.E., M.E, Memphis on the airport\Ntruck. Everything else right there. Nicolai! Tick-tock, tick-tock.\NFour minutes. - Hi, this is Kelly.\N- If you're calling for Chuck, press one. Otherwise leave a message\Nafter the tone. Thanks. Hello, Kelly. Are you there? Pick up, pick up, pick up,\Npick up. You're not there. You're not gonna believe this. I'm doin'\Nthe sorts in the middle of Red Square... in the shadow of Lenin's tomb. I'm outta here in two minutes and I'm\Npickin' up the sweep through Paris... so I should be back in Memphis\Nabout 18 hours or so. That's the good news.\NThe bad news is... I gotta go to\Nthe dentist this week. I got something in there\Nthat's hurtin'. I love you and I'm gonna see you soon,\Nand you know what that means. Bye-bye. Nicolai! Tick-tock, tick-tock,\Ntick-tock, tick-tock! I absolutely, positively have\Nto get to Memphis tonight. Can't help you. Try U.P.S. With this extra head wind, are we gonna\Nbe able to push it and make the sort? - We'll do our best.\N- "Our best," huh? Gwen, is there something\Nwrong with our doctors that Jack keeps getting\Ncertified to fly? - Aren't you concerned?\N- I'm terrified. But a girl's gotta do\Nwhat a girl's gotta do. That's the spirit.\NRelentless is our goal. Relentless! What do you expect from the guy\Nwho stole a crippled kid's bicycle... - when his truck broke down?\N- I borrowed it. But I love that\Nthe kid's now crippled. So you missed the last truck\Nby two minutes? Two minutes.\NActually, it was less than that. The plane wasn't that heavy.\NYou could've added some fuel... picked up the speed\Nand made up the time. It's about the trucks.\NToday's truck was two minutes late. Tomorrow's will be four minutes late, and\Nthen six minutes and eight minutes late. - Next thing you know, we're the U.S. Mail.\N- Yeah, well... All I'm sayin' is, if you'd gotten\Nall those trucks on the plane... those Russkies would be\Nwalking on water right now. Hey, don't...\NDon't gimme that look. - It's just grape juice. Right, Chuck?\N- Yeah. It's like a 1992\Nfull-bodied grape juice. I see no evil, hear no evil,\Nspeak no evil. We'd offer you some but, you know,\Nsomebody's got to fly the plane. Yeah, well,\NI "just say no," right? Listen, Stan,\NI've been meaning to ask you. How's Mary? Oh. Uh, well... - we really don't know anything yet.\N- Mm-hmm. Uh, she went to the doctor yesterday,\Nand, uh... it hasn't meta...\Nmetastasized... as far as they\Ncan tell right now. It's just kind of wait and see. I'm so sorry. Tell her I'm gonna come by\Nand see her on my next layover. I want you to know, Stan, we are\Nall thinking about her and you. - And just blessings.\N- Thank you, Gwen. Hi, this is Kelly.\NIf you're calling for Chuck, press one. Otherwise, leave a message\Nafter the tone. Thanks. Stan. Listen.\NUh, I heard about this... I heard about this doctor\Ndown in Emory, in Atlanta. Uh, he's supposed to be\Nthe absolute best. He worked on\NFrank Toretta's wife. Frank Toretta is\Na systems analyst. He played center field for us.\NYou know him. In the softball tournament\Nlast Labor Day. Anyway, beside the point. Uh, what I was thinking is,\Nis that I could get his number... the doctor... and, uh... you know,\Nput you all together and... You know, you could\Nget this thing fixed. You could beat it. Thanks, Chuck. So, I'll get his number. - Is Kelly Frears around?\N- She's copying her dissertation. - You're home.\N- Home indeed. I love that you're home. Just days before Santa departs on his annual\Ngift-giving venture... he's been declared\Nphysically fit to fly. Santa got checked out by doctors\Nat the V.A. Hospital in Augusta, Georgia. After they declared\Nthe jolly old elf in tiptop shape... Santa Claus took off into the wild\Nblue yonder for an early start. In Sarajevo,\Nhe spent the day with children... handing out presents and\Neven helping them decorate... the special Christmas tree. Santa and a sea of elves\Ntook over the floor... at the Hong Kong\NFutures Exchange. Market traders\Nbought Santa hats, donating... The turkey's a little dry,\Nisn't it? - No.\N- The turkey is perfect. - How many did you do last night?\N- Last night? 2.9 million. Now you've got to be in the market\Nfor more of these candied yams. Here you go. 2.9 has got to be the record. Look at those marshmallows. When I was there,\Nwe did two million. - We thought that was a big deal.\N- The glory days. - What'd they do the first night?\N- The very first night? - Twelve.\N- Twelve thousand? - Hell, no. Twelve.\N- That's right. And they did the sort\Nright there on a card table. And Fred Smith had\Nthat card table bronzed. I've been hearing that\Nfor five years. It's in his office today. They go from that to the\Nnew hub up in Anchorage. It's state of the art...\Na perfect marriage... between technology\Nand systems management. Speaking of marriage, Chuck, when are you\Ngonna make an honest woman out of Kelly? - How long?\N- Fourteen minutes into the meal. - You won. I owe you $5.\N- So I win. - Way before the pie.\N- I told him on the way up. Right about the time the pie\Ncame out, the marriage... Kelly is still recovering from her failed\Nrelationship with that parolee. He was a lawyer. I knew it had something to do\Nwith raising your right hand... and swearing to tell the truth. Remember when he fell\Non the sidewalk and broke his shoulder at\Nthe wedding reception? He tripped on a curb\Nholding a door open for me. - Aunt Kelly was married before?\N- It's not even worth remembering. So since her failed marriage\Nto the parolee... Oh, my God. Kelly can't see being with a\Nman who wears a pager to bed. What're you gonna\Nattach it to, Hoss? When you wear it to bed, I hope\Nyou got one of those things... that go vibratin'. Watch it.\NI'm not touching that. Oh, did you hit an olive pit? - I thought I took all of them out.\N- No, no, it's not that. - Okay, I'll cancel Saturday.\N- No, don't. If I'm not here, I'm not.\NBut if I am, well... - then I am.\N- It's cancelled. But you gotta be here\NNew Year's Eve. Malaysia can't be that bad.\NI'll be here New Year's Eve. - When are you defending your dissertation?\N- January 12. I'm gonna have to switch\Nover the South America thing. If I do that\Non the third or fourth... I'm gonna have to head\Nback out on the 13th. So long as you're here\NNew Year's Eve. I will be here New Year's Eve.\NI promise. What? What about our Christmas?\NI got a gift for you. We have to do it in the car. I'd just like a minute\Nover here, all right? Thanks. Two minutes, okay? Two more minutes. Thanks. Hey! - Merry Christmas.\N- I thought you were gonna stiff me. No. - What is the ribbon?\NIs it a thousand-pound... - test fishing line or something?\N- Here's your fancy thing. Thanks. I love the wrapping. - And I love the box.\N- Good. Oh. Oh, my. Oh, that is terrific. My grandaddy used it\Non the Southern Pacific. Hey, I took this. This is\Nmy favorite picture of you. You know what I'm gonna do?\NI'm always gonna keep this... on Memphis time. Kelly time. Hmm. You haven't said anything about\Nyour presents. Is there a problem? I'm sorry, no! I love 'em. Look at my journal. Ah! - What about the pager?\N- Real leather. The pages have gold on 'em. - Did you like the pager or not?\N- Yes. I love it. Look at him in\Nhis little blue Russian house. - It's from Russia.\N- My God. - It's not one of those loud ones?\N- No. You can program it so it vibrates... and lights up\Nand see it in the dark. It seems like\Na real nice pager. Sorry about the hand towels.\NYou're hard to shop for. No, no. I love 'em. Every time I wash my hands,\NI will think of you. All right, I gotta go. - Merry Christmas.\N- Merry Christmas. - I love you.\N- I love you too. Chuck! Keys! - Thank you.\N- That reminds me. I almost forgot. I have one more present\Nfor you. Only this isn't an "open in the car"\Nkind of present... like, say, hand towels. Which were a joke, by the way. I'm terrified. Just take it and hold onto it,\Nand you can open it... on New Year's Eve. And I love you. I'll be right back. Hey, Al, where are we? Somewhere over\Nthe Pacific Ocean. Ha, ha, ha!\NYou pilots, you're funny. Tahiti Control, FedEx 88. Position Jenna at 1526... Is all this turbulence from Santa\Nand those eight tiny reindeer? Tamara at 1620. Erick is next. Fuel: niner-five-decimal-five. Blaine, tell them we're\Ndeviating south for weather. Make another position plot\Non your deviation left. Tahiti Control,\NFedEx 88. Position Jenna at 1526. - Flight level 350.\N- I got us plotted. We're 200 miles south\Nof our original course. Continue plotting,\Nand check contingency procedures. Tahiti Control, FedEx 88. Broadcasting in the blind.\NHow do you read? I've never been\Nout of comm this long. Did you try the higher\NH.F. frequency? Tahiti Control, FedEx 88. Better buckle up, Chuck.\NIt's gonna get bumpy. Tahiti Control, FedEx 88. Do you read? Tahiti Control, FedEx 88. Position Jenna at 1526. Flight level 350. Expecting Tamara at 1... Fire! Explosion! Let's get a hose! Hold on to it! Come on! Seat belt! We may have to ditch! Okay? Fire in the hold! We're goin' down! Mayday! Mayday! Bringing it down and out! Ten thousand feet! Masks off! Masks off! Chuck! Life vest! Chuck! Chuck, stay there! Where's your life vest? Ditching switch on! I've got visual! Brace for impact! Hello! Hello! Anybody! Anybody! Help! What is that? Hey! Hey! Anybody? Hello? Get! Go, go. Go! Go! "Albert R. Miller." Not Alan. Albert. So, that's it. Hey! A ship! Hey! Hey! A ship! Over here! Hey! Hey! Over here! Over here! Over here! Over here! Over here! Help me! Help!\NRight here! Right here! Help! Look here!\NLook, look, look! S... O... S! Please! Help! Come on! Help! "Happy birthday." "The most beautiful thing in the world is,\Nof course, the world itself. Johnny, have the happiest birthday ever.\NScore. Your Grandpa." Ew. Come on. Come on. Come on. You wouldn't have a match...\Nby any chance, would you? Oh, oh, oh! The air got to it. The air got to it! Come on, come on. Come on. I did it. I did it. Fire! There you go! Light it up! Come on! Ouch! Here you go! Here you go! It's a signal fire! And it spells out S.O.S! Whoa! It's a meteor shower! Fireflies! Go! Run! You're free! You're free!\NOuch! Ouch! Yeah! Yes! Look what I have created! I have made fire! I... have made fire! Mmm! You gotta love crab. In the nick of time too. I couldn't take much more\Nof those coconuts. Coconut milk's\Na natural laxative. Things that Gilligan\Nnever told us. Oh. Pretty well-made fire,\Nhuh, Wilson? So... Wilson. We were en route... from Memphis\Nfor 11 and a half hours. About 475 miles an hour. So they think that\Nwe are right here. But... we went out of radio contact... and flew around that storm\Nfor about an hour. So that's a distance\Nof what, 400 miles? Four hundred miles squared. That's 160,000... times pi... 3.14. Five hundred and two thousand,\Nfour... That's a search area\Nof 500,000 square miles. That's twice the size of Texas. They may never find us. This tooth is just killing me. It started out just hurting\Nwhen I bit down... but now it just hurts\Nall the time. All the time. It's-It's a good thing there's\Nnot much to eat around here... because I don't think\NI could chew it. Just keep sucking on all that coconut\Nand all that crab. And just think... I used to avoid\Ngoing to the dentist... like the plague. I put it off every single chance I got.\NBut now... oh, what I wouldn't give... to have a-a dentist\Nright here in this cave. In fact,\NI wish you were a dentist. Yeah. Dr. Wilson. You wanna hear something funny? Back home in Memphis... my dentist's name is\NDr. James Spaulding. She's much prettier\Nin real life. Shut up! "Bakersfield"? Bakersfield! This could work. This could work. Twenty-two...\NForty-four lashings. Forty-four lashings. So... We have to make rope again. Wilson, we're gonna have to make\Na hell of a lot of rope. Eight lashings\Nof these structurals. That's 24 apiece. That'll be 100... 160. Here we are today. That gives us another month and a half\Nuntil we're into March and April... which is our best chances for the\Nhigh tides and the offshore breezes. We need... We need 424 feet... of good rope, plus another 50 feet,\Nsay, for miscellaneous. Round that off to\N475 feet of good rope. Now, if we average\N15 feet a day... Plus, we have to build it... we have to stock it,\Nwe have to launch it. That's gonna be tight. That is not much time. But we... We live and we die by time,\Ndon't we? Now, let's not commit the sin\Nof turning our back on time. I know. This is it. That's all that's left. I checked over the whole island,\Nand that is all that's left. So we're gonna be short. Short. We'll just have to make some more\Nout of the videotape. Yes. No, we have time. We do. We have time. Look! The wind's still blowing in\Nfrom the west. I know! Yeah, I know... I know where\Nthere's 30 feet of extra rope! But... But I'm not\Ngoing back up there. There, there.\NThere, you see? Huh? There. Are you happy? Do you have to keep bringing that up?\NCan't you just forget it? Huh? You were right. You were right. It was a good thing\Nthat we did a test... 'cause it wasn't gonna be\Njust a quick little snap. I would have landed\Non the rocks. Broken my leg or my back or my neck.\NBled to death. But it was the only option I had\Nat the time though, okay? It was what, a year ago? So let's just forget it. And what is your point? Well... we might just make it. Did that thought\Never cross your brain? Well, regardless, I would rather\Ntake my chance out there on the ocean... than to stay here and die\Non this shithole island... spending the rest of my life talking\Nto a goddamn volleyball! Shut you up. Wilson! Wilson! Wilson! Wilson! Wilson. Wilson! Oh, God! Wilson! Wilson! Oh! Oh! Never again.\NNever again, never again. You're okay. You okay? Yeah. Yeah, I know you. I know you. I know you. So, we okay? Okay? Okay. You still awake? Me too. You scared? Me too. Okay. Here we go, Wilson. You don't have to worry\Nabout anything. I'll do all the paddling. You just hang on. Not yet! Hold on! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Stand by, Wilson! Hold on! Hold on, Wilson! I think we did it! I think we did it! Wilson! I think we did it! Oh! They're gone! I don't know why! Where's Wilson? Where's Wilson? Wilson, where are you? Wilson! Wilson! Wilson! I'm comin'! Wilson! Wilson! Wilson... Wilson! Wilson! Wilson! Wilson! Wilson! I'm sorry! I'm sorry, Wilson! Wilson, I'm sorry! I'm sorry! Wilson! I can't! Wilson! Wilson! I'm... I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Kelly. Kelly. Kelly. Hello? Oh, how are you? Okay. Forty-five minutes. One Dr. Pepper. Two cups of ice. I like ice. Well, here's the drill. Um, plane pulls in,\Nwe get off... and there's a little ceremony\Nright there in the hangar. Fred Smith\Nwill say a few words. All you have to do is smile\Nand say "thank you." Then we'll take you over\Nto see Kelly. She's actually gonna\Nbe there, huh? Well, that's what\Nwe have arranged. I mean, if you're sure\Nyou wanna do that. Oh, yeah, yeah. Yes. I don't know what\NI'm gonna say to her. What in the world\Nam I gonna say to her? Chuck, Kelly had to let you go. You know? She thought you were dead. And we buried you. We had a funeral and a coffin\Nand a gravestone. The whole thing. You had a coffin? What was in it? Well, everybody put\Nsomething in. You know, just a cell phone\Nor a beeper, some pictures. I put in some Elvis CDs. So you had my funeral... and then you had\NMary's funeral. Stan, I'm so sorry\NI wasn't around when Mary died. I should've been there for you,\Nand I wasn't. I'm so sorry. Four years ago... the FedEx family lost\Nfive of our sons. That was a terrible\Nand tragic day. But today, one of those sons... Chuck Noland,\Nhas been returned to us. Chuck, welcome home. Just moments ago,\NFred Smith welcomed home Chuck Noland. How about it, Michelle? It's such an incredible\Nand amazing story... to come back from the dead. Well, it's so amazing that\NSmith himself welcomed him back. And Fred acknowledged that,\N"While time waits for no man... we take time to pause\Nto honor one of our own." Now, that's an expensive pause. I'm-I'm sorry.\NI must be in the wrong place. No, you're in the right place. You probably don't remember me. I actually\Ndid root canal on you about five years ago. Jim Spaulding referred you. Oh, yeah, yeah. I'm Kelly's husband. Jerry Lovett. Kelly wanted... Kelly wanted to be here... Look, this is very hard\Nfor everyone. I can't even imagine\Nhow hard it is for you. Kelly, uh... She's had it rough. First when she thought\Nshe lost you... and now dealing\Nwith all of this. It's-It's confusing.\NIt's very emotional for her. She's... She's... sort of lost. Maybe you could just\Ngive her a little more time. Anyway, uh... I'm sorry that... Okay, people, let's go. Party's over. Let's go home.\NLet's go home. You're definitely gonna\Nhave to go down to the DMV. Okay, Maynard, let's go.\NChuck's had a big day. I have to brief this man\Non his meetings tomorrow... I know. With the accountants\Nand the attorneys, all right? I will see you bright and early\Nin the morning. - Hey, Chuck, welcome home. We love you.\N- Becca, I need to speak to you. You know, Chuck, we gotta catch up\Non some of that fishin', now. Take care. - Good night.\N- Good night. You got everything\Nyou need? Okay. Well, if you need anything,\Njust sign for it... and I'll see you\Nin the morning. Get some sleep, okay?\NWe got another big day tomorrow. It takes a lot of paperwork\Nto bring back a man. - Bring you back to life, man.\N- Bye, Chuck. - Take care, now.\N- Tomorrow. Tomorrow we're gonna\Nbring you back to life. How long are you gonna be, man? Well... - how long will that buy me?\N- About ten minutes. I'm awake. I saw your taxi drive up. Get in here out of the rain. I saw you\Ndown at the hub today... so I know you were down there. Let me get you a towel. They're sleeping. If you come in,\NI'll make you some coffee. It's a nice house. Yeah, we got\Na nice mortgage too. What's your daughter's name? Katie. - She's a beautiful little girl.\N- She's a handful. Just let me get\None thing straight here. We have a pro football team now,\Nbut they're in Nashville? Um, yeah. Oh, my God. Okay.\NThey used to be in Houston. First they were the Oilers,\Nand now they're the Titans. The Houston Oilers\Nare the Tennessee Titans? Yeah. But that's not all. They went to the Super Bowl\Nlast year. - And I missed that.\N- You would've died. It was so exciting. They almost won by one yard.\NOne lousy yard right at the end. I got whole milk,\N2% and nonfat. I don't have any half-and-half,\Nand that's what you like. That'll do fine. What happened to you\Nbecoming a professor? You're not\NDr. Kelly Frears-Lovett? When you, um... When your plane went down... everything just sort of\Ngot put on hold. I think about\Ntaking it up again, though. I came out here\Nto give you this. Oh, my God. I'm sorry it doesn't work. And I, uh, I kept the picture. It was all faded anyway. I want you to have it.\NI gave it to you. That's a family heirloom,\Nand it should stay in your family. That's everything I have\Nfrom when you went down to now. They said they never figured out\Nwhat caused the crash. Probably some mislabeled\Nhazardous material caught fire. So here's where\Nthat ship found you. You drifted about 500 miles. This is where\Nyour island was... about 600 miles\Nsouth of the Cook Islands. And these are the search grids. Ships went back and forth\Nfor weeks looking for you. I never should've\Ngotten on that plane. I never should've\Ngotten out of the car. I wanna show you something. Come here. This is... This is our car. You kept our car. All right, now, this is weird. It's a good car. Had a lot of memories\Nin this car. Two very nice memories. Oh, that trip\Ndown to the Gulf, yeah. So, can I drive it? It's your car. That's good, 'cause my...\Nmy taxi's gone. Um... Let me get some stuff\Nout of the back. You think you're gonna\Nhave more kids? I don't know. It's kind of confusing\Nright now. Well, you should. I mean, really, you should. I would. So, what now? I don't know. I really don't know. You said you'd be right back. I'm so sorry. Me too. Chuck! Chuck! I always knew you were alive. I knew it. But everybody said\NI had to stop saying that... that I had to let you go. I love you. You're the love of my life. I love you too, Kelly. More than you'll ever know. Chuck? You have to go home. We both had done\Nthe math, and... Kelly added it all up. She knew she had to let me go. I added it up, knew that I'd... I'd lost her. 'Cause I was never gonna\Nget off that island. I was gonna die there... totally alone. I mean, I was gonna get sick or I was\Ngonna get injured or something. The only choice I had... the only thing\NI could control... was when and how... and where\Nthat was gonna happen. So... I made a rope. And I went up to the summit\Nto hang myself. But I had to test it, you know? Of course. You know me. And the weight of the log... snapped the limb of the tree. So I-I... I couldn't even kill myself\Nthe way I wanted to. I had power over nothing. And that's when this feeling came over me\Nlike a warm blanket. I knew... somehow... that I had to stay alive. Somehow. I had to keep breathing... even though there was\Nno reason to hope. And all my logic said that I would never\Nsee this place again. So that's what I did. I stayed alive. I kept breathing. And then one day\Nthat logic was proven all wrong... because the tide... came in, gave me a sail. And now, here I am. I'm back... in Memphis, talking to you. I have ice in my glass. And I've lost her\Nall over again. I'm so sad that\NI don't have Kelly. But I'm so grateful that\Nshe was with me on that island. And I know\Nwhat I have to do now. I gotta keep breathing. Because tomorrow,\Nthe sun will rise. Who knows what the tide\Ncould bring? Hello! Hello! FedEx! - You look lost.\N- I do? Where are you headed? Well, I was just about\Nto figure that out. Well, that's 83 South. And this road here will\Nhook you up with I-40 East. If you turn right... that'll take you to\NAmarillo, Flagstaff... California. And if you head back\Nthat direction... you'll find a whole lotta nothin'\Nall the way to Canada. I got it. All right, then. Good luck, cowboy. Thank you.
