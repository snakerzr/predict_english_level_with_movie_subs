It's hormonal. I mean, I don't usually fall\Nback on.. It's women's issues. But child-proofed how?\NGates and stuff? Dude, she did the drawers. We don't even know if this\Nwhole fertility thing's gonna work.. she's screwed in these little jobbies\Nwhere you can't even open the drawers. At all? No. They open an inch,\Nthen you gotta dig your finger in. - It's a nightmare.\N-I guess sooner or later.. Yeah, a lot later.\NShe did the upper cabinets. Kid will be 30 before he can\Nreach them, assuming we have a kid. It is natural for\Nher to feel protective. Don't even.. You have women's issues. Please. You of all people. Oh, come on. It's a jinx. It guarantees that\Nwe won't get pregnant. And it takes me about 20\Nminutes to get a fucking beer. Guys. Guys! Stockholm went south. Seriously?\NI thought they were looking good. What cracked? I haven't seen the footage.\NWord's just going around Well, that's never\Nbeen a stable scenario. Everyone knows you can't trust Swedes. That means there's just Japan.\NJapan and us. It's not the first time\Nit's come down to that. Japan has a perfect record. We're number two. We try harder. If we fail, then.. Please. We haven't\Nhad a glitch since '98. We know what we're doing, Lin. Or we have it written down..\Nsomewhere. You guys better not\Nbe messing around in there. Does this mean you're not in\Nthe betting pool this year? Big money. I'm just saying, it's a key scenario. No, I hear what you're saying. In '98, it was the chem\Ndepartment's fault, right? Where do you work, again?\NWait. It's coming back to me, now. It's gonna be a long weekend\Nif everyone's that puckered up. You wanna come over Monday night? I'm gonna pick up some power drills.\NLiberate my cabinets. Are you even listening to me? Professor fuckwad. Why haven't you stuck that asshole's\Npicture on the dartboard yet? It's not that simple\NOh, my God! - Your hair. It's blonde.\N- Very fabulous, no? - I can't believe you did it.\N-But very fabulous, right? Hurry up with the "very fabulous."\NI'm getting insecure about it now. No, it looks awesome.\NCurt's gonna lose it. Curt's gonna thank me.\NAnd so will you.. while we're burning this picture. Not ready. Seriously, this isn't his fault. What's not his fault? Fucking his student or\Nbreaking up with her by email? I knew what I was getting into. Oh, please. You know what you're\Ngetting into this weekend? This. And if Holden's as\Ncute as Curt says he is.. possibly getting out of it. That is the last thing that I want. If you treat this like a setup,\NI'm gonna have no fun at all. I'm not pushing.. but we're packing this! Which means we definitely\Nwon't have room for.. What if I get bored? These will help? Soviet Economic Structures?\NAftermath of the.. No! We have a lake and a keg. No more learning!\N-Think fast. Faster than that. Sorry. Sorry. Move along. Nice!\N-Is that Holden? We'll be right down.\NHe just transferred from State. Best hands on the team.\NHe's a sweet guy. And he's good with his hands. I'm kinda seeing this girl.. but you're way blonder than she is. But I was thinking, you know, maybe..\NWhat is this? What.. this?\NWhat are you doing with these? Okay, I get it. I'll leave the books. No, who gave you these?\NWho taught you about these? I learned it from you, okay? I learned it from watching you! Seriously, Professor Bennett, he\Ncovers this whole book in his lectures. You should read this. Gurovsky. Now this is way\Nmore interesting. Also, Bennett doesn't\Nknow it by heart.. so he'll think you're insightful. And you have no pants. Oh, shit! - That pretty much it?\N-Fucking better be. You know, Jules,\Nit's a weekend, not an evacuation. Trust me when I say there\Nis nothing in those cases.. you won't be glad I brought. I'm shutting' right up. Oh, my God. Marty! Fuck is wrong with you, bro? People in this town drive\Nin a very counterintuitive manner. That's what I have to say. Do you wanna spend\Nthe weekend in jail? We'd all like to check\Nout my cousin's country home. Honey, that's not okay. Statistical fact.. Cops will never pull over\Na man with a huge bong in his car. Why? They fear this man.\NThey know he sees further than they.. and he will bind them\Nwith ancient logics. Have you gone gray? You're not bringing\Nthat thing in the Rambler. What? A giant bong in your father's van? What are you, stoned? Hey, man. Dana, you fetching minx! You have any food? Everybody ready?\N- Yeah! Yeah?\N- Okay, I'm ready! Let's get this show on the road! Nest is empty. We're right on time. I hope this is the right road. It doesn't even show up on the GPS. It is unworthy of global positioning. That's the whole point.\NGet off the grid, right? No cell phone reception.. no traffic cameras. Go someplace for one goddamn\Nweekend where they can't.. globally position my ass, man. This is the whole issue. Is society crumbling, Marty? No. Society is binding. Right? It's filling in the\Ncracks with concrete. Everything's filed or\Nrecorded or blogged, right? Chips in our kids' heads\Nso they won't get lost. Society needs to crumble. We're all just too\Nchicken-shit to let it. I've missed your rants. You will come to see things my way. Identification, please. Mr. Sitterson. Mr. Hadley.\N- Thank you. What's your name?\N- Daniel Truman, sir. This isn't the military.\NYou can drop the "sir". But Sitterson does\Nlike to be called "ma'am." Or "honey toes."\N- He'll also answer to "honey toes." You clear on what's\Ngonna be happening here? I've been prepped. Extensively. Did they tell you that being prepped\Nis not the same as being prepared? They told me.\NI'll hold my post, Mr. Hadley. Good man. Okay. System's online. Acquiring target.\NLet's see what we got. I'm thinking this thing\Ndoesn't take credit cards. I don't think it knows about money. I think it's barter gas. Hello? Hey, Holden. Holden!\N- I don't think there's gonna be.. You come here uninvited?\N- Fuck! Sign says "closed." Yeah, we were looking to buy some gas. Does this pump work? If you know how to work it. We also wanted to get directions. We're looking for.. What's it called? Tillerman Road.\NDo you know if it's this way? Tillerman Road takes\Nyou up the hill, there. Dead-ends at the old Buckner place. My cousin bought a house up there. You go through a mountain tunnel,\Nthere's a lake. Would that be the..\N- Buckner place. Always someone looking\Nto sell that plot. You knew the original owners. Yeah, not the first. I seen plenty come and go.\NHell, I been here since the war. - Which war?\N- You know damn well which war! Would that have been with\Nthe blue and some in gray? Brother, perhaps,\Nfighting against brother in that war? You sassing me, boy? You were rude to my friend. That whore? What'd you say?\N-I think we got enough gas. You got enough to get you there. Getting back.. that's your concern. Well, good luck with\Nyour business, sir. I know the railroad's coming\Nthrough here any day, now. That's gonna be big. Streets paved with actual street. Fucker. This must be it. Oh, my God. It's.. beautiful. One spider and I'm\Nsleeping in the Rambler. I mean it. Come on. Give me a hand. This is awesome. It is kind of cool. You gonna kill us a raccoon to eat? I will use its skin to make a cap. Everybody get your suits on. In\N10 minutes, we're heading to the lake. Yeah. I was not informed there\Nwould be calisthenics. Yeah, I don't think so. Whoa. No way. Ah, shit. This is happening. Hold up! You've gotta be fucking kidding me. That's just creepy. It was pioneer days. People had to make their\Nown interrogation rooms. Who did your cousin\Nbuy this place from? We should check the rest of the rooms,\Nmake sure this is the only one. 'Cause you know Marty wants\Nto watch us pounding away. I didn't even like hearing that. How about we switch? Not that I'd.. I mean, I'd put the picture back but you\Nmight feel better if we switched rooms? I really would. Thanks. For being decent. It's the least I could do.. since Curt and Jules\Nsold you to me for marriage. They're not subtle. Well, I'll just be flattered\Nand keep it to myself. Yeah, I'm not looking for.. But, I'm still grateful\Nthat you're not a creep. Hey, let's not jump\Nto any conclusions there. I had kind of an internal\Ndebate about showing you the mirror. Shouting on both sides.\NBlood was spilled. So, you're bleeding internally? Pretty bad. Well, Jules is pre-med.\NYou should probably talk to her. Okay. Wow. Yeah, I don't think so. Places everyone. We are live. Engineering, we got a room change. Polk is now in two, McCrea is in four. Operations, do you copy?\NWe need a scenario adjustment. Miss Lin. We've got the blood work\Nback on Louden. Her levels are good. But we're recommending\Na fifty-milligram bump.. of Rhohyptase to increase libido. - Sold. - Do we pipe it in,\Nor do you wanna do it orally? Ask me that again, only slower. You're a pig. Guess how we're\Nslowing down cognition. I don't know. The hair dye. Dumb blonde. Very artistic. Works its way into the blood,\Nthrough the scalp. Very gradual. Chem department keeps their end up. I'll see it when I believe it. Control?\N- Yeah, go ahead. I have the harbinger on line two. Oh, Christ. Can you take a message? I don't think so. He's really pushy. To be honest,\Nhe's kind of freaking me out. Okay. Put him on. Mordecai, baby, what's happening?\NHow's the weather up top? The lambs have passed through the gate.\NThey are come to the killing floor. Well, you're doing\Na great job out there. By the numbers, man.\NYou got us started off just right. So, we'll talk to you later, okay? Their blind eyes see nothing\Nof the horrors to come. Their ears are stopped. They are the gods' fools. Well, that's.. how it works. Cleanse them. Cleanse the\Nworld of their ignorance and sin. Bathe them in the crimson of.. Am I on speakerphone? No. Absolutely not. Speakerphone, no.\NNo, I wouldn't do that. Yes, I am. I can hear the echo. Oh, my God. You're right.\NHang on one second, I'll take you off. That's rude.\NI don't know who's in the room. Fine. There. You're off. Thank you. Don't take this lightly, boy. It wasn't all by your numbers. The fool nearly derailed\Nthe invocation with his insolence. The ancient ones see everything. And they will not be.. I'm still on speakerphone, aren't I? Oh, my God. Mordecai. I can't believe it. I did it again! Mordy? What happens next? Oh! That's cold! How cold? Is it worth it? Come on, Jules. Life is risk. Yeah, I might just risk\Nlying out in the sun for a while. Boo. Hey, what is that?\N- What? In the lake, right there. Oh, come on. - No you guys,\NI'm serious. Right there. There! There!\NGod, looks just like my girlfriend! Oh, my God! There's something else in the lake! It's a gorgeous man!\N- I'm gonna kill you! Don't kill the gorgeous man!\NWe're endangered! All right. Last chance. It's post time. Dig deep, people.\NBetting windows are closing. Okay. Okay, who's still out? Let's see. We got engineering,\Nwe got R & D, and we got electrical. Did you see who they picked? They're practically\Ngiving their money away. You should talk, Aquaman. What do you mean?\N- Ah, nothing. Okay, all right. I'm not even sure\Nwe have one of these. Zoology swears we do. They'd know. Okay. All right, people. Hey, what do you got? No, they've already been picked. What? No. Who took them? Maintenance. Maintenance?\NThey pick the same thing every year. What do you want from me? If they were creative,\Nthey wouldn't be in maintenance. You're gonna have to split\Nthis if you win. You wanna switch? I don't know, I don't know.\NWhat do you think? More than anything,\NI just want this moment to end. Not betting? Not for me. Thanks. Seems a little harsh, doesn't it? It's just people letting off steam. This job isn't easy,\Nhowever those clowns may behave. Does the director.\NDo they know about this downstairs? The director doesn't\Ncare about this stuff. As long as everything\Ngoes smoothly upstairs.. as long as the kids\Ndo as they're told. But then it's fixed. No, no, no. How can you wager on this\Nwhen you control the outcome? No, we just get 'em in the cellar.\NThey take it from there. No, they have to make the\Nchoice of their own free will. Otherwise the system doesn't work. It's like the harbinger. It's this creepy old fuck, practically\Nwears a sign, "You will die." Why do we put him there? The system. They have to choose to ignore him.. and they have to choose\Nwhat happens in the cellar. Yeah, we rig the game\Nas much as we need to.. but in the end,\Nthey don't transgress.. hey can't be punished. So what's it gonna be, Truman?\NYou in? Window's closing. I'm fine. Okay. That's it, gang! The board is locked! Oh, let's get this party started! Let's get this party started! There you go. Okay, my turn. Jules. Truth or dare? Let's go dare. All right. I dare you to make out with.. Please say "Dana," please say "Dana." That moose, over there. Marty.. have you ever seen a moose before? Whatever that mysterious beast is. That's a wolf. I'm living in a womb of reefer,\Nleave me alone. Jules.. I dare you to make out with that wolf. No problem. Who? Me? Well, yes, I am new in town. How did you know? Oh, my God.\NThat is so sweet of you to say. I just colored it, in fact. No, no, no. There's no need to huff and puff. I'll let you come in. Thank you. Yeah. Now,... Dana. Truth. What's that supposed to mean? I'm just skipping ahead. You're gonna say dare. She's gonna dare you to\Ndo something you don't like.. and then you'll puss out and\Nsay that you wanted truth all along. Really? Okay, Jules. Dare. What the hell was that? It's the cellar door. The wind must've blown it open. That makes what kinda sense? What do you think is down there? Why don't we find out? Dana. I dare you. How long do I have to stay down here? Oh, you know, just 'til morning. Dana. You okay? Yeah. Sorry, I just scared myself. Well, you called for help.\NThat voids the dare. Take your top off. What? I don't make up the rules. Oh, my God. Look at all this. Guys.. I'm not sure it's\Nawesome to be down here. Guys? Dude, seriously,\Nyour cousin is into some weird shit. I'm pretty sure this ain't his. Maybe it was the people\Nwho put in that mirror thing. Some of this stuff looks really old. It's beautiful. Maybe we should go back upstairs. I dare you all to go upstairs. Guys? Guys, listen to this. "April fourth. "Father was cross with me\Nand said I lacked the true faith. "I wish I could prove my devotion.. "as Judah and Matthew\Nproved on those travelers." What is that? Diary of Anna Patience Buckner, 1903. "Mama screamed most of the night. "I prayed that she might find faith.. "but she only stopped\Nwhen Papa cut her belly.. "and stuffed the coals in. "Judah told me in my dream.. "that Matthew took him to the\Nblack room, so I know he is killed. "I want to understand the\Nglory of the pain like Matthew.. "but cutting the flesh makes\Nhim have a husband's bulge.. "and I do not get like that." - Jesus. Can we not?\N- No. Go on. - Why?\N-I want to know. "I have found it.. "in the oldest books,\Nthe way of saving our family. "My good arm is hacked up.. "and et,\Nso I hope this will be readable. "That a believer will come\Nand speak this to our spirits. "Then we will be restored\Nand the great pain will return." And then there's something in Latin. Okay, I'm drawing a line\Nin the fucking sand, here. Do not read the Latin. What the fuck? - Dolor..\N- No, no. - Stop being a fucking baby.\N- Curt! It's a diary. It doesn't even mean anything. - Dana!\N- "Dolor supervivo caro. "Dolor sublimis caro. "Dolor ignio annivos." We have a winner! It's the Buckners,\Nladies and gentlemen! The Buckners pull a 'W'. All right. That means that\Ncongratulations go to Maintenance! Who share the pot\Nwith Ronald the intern. Yeah! That's not fair. I had zombies, too. Yes, you did. You had zombies. But this is\N"Zombie Redneck Torture Family," see? They're entirely separate species. Like the difference between\Nan elephant and an elephant seal. There's always next year. They're like something\Nfrom a nightmare. No. They're something\Nnightmares are from. Everything in our stable\Nis remnant of the old world.. courtesy of you-know-who. Monsters. Magic. Gods. You get used to it. Should you? Oh, man. I'm sorry. - He had the conch in his hands.\N- I know. A couple more minutes,\Nwho knows what might've happened? I am never gonna see a merman. Ever. Dude, be thankful. Those things are terrifying. And the cleanup on\Nthem is a nightmare. So, the Buckners. Yeah, well, they may be zombified,\Npain-worshipping, backwoods idiots.. But they're our zombified,\Npain-worshipping, backwoods idiots. With a hundred percent clearance rate. True. So should we call Japan? Tell them to take the\Nrest of the weekend off? Yeah, right. They're Japanese.\NWhat are they gonna do? Relax? I'd just like to see them\Nfall on their asses, for once. Oh, God, don't even joke. Every other branch has air-balled. We need the Japanese crew to get it\Ndone. There's too much riding on this. Fuck, yeah, baby. This is so classy. Come on, like you wouldn't\Nwant a piece of that. Can we not talk about people\Nin pieces any more tonight? Are you feeling lonely, Marty? Marty and I were sweeties\Nin our freshman hall. We made out once. I never did buy that ring. But we're still.. close. I have a theory about all this. That's our cue to bail. Tommy Chong here has a theory.\NCome on, baby. Don't worry,\Nyou can tell it to Egghead, here.. if he's not too busy\Ndevirginizing Dana. Jules, do you wanna go lie down? That's exactly the point.\NCome on. Mush. Mush. Don't push me around. Not around, baby. Straight line. You seriously believe\Nnothing weird is going on? Conspiracy? The way everybody's acting. Why is Jules suddenly a celebu-tard? And since when does Curt\Npull this alpha-male bullshit? I mean, he's a sociology major. He's on full academic scholarship.. and now he's calling\Nhis friend an egghead? Curt's just drunk. I've seen Curt drunk. Jules, too. Well, then, maybe it's something else. You're not seeing\Nwhat you don't wanna see. Puppeteers. Puppeteers? Pop-Tarts? Did you say you have Pop-Tarts? Marty, I love you,\Nbut you're really high. We are not who we are. I'm gonna go read\Na book with pictures. Thank you.\N- "The pain outlives the flesh. "The flesh returns.. "\Nor "has a meeting place." What is that? The Latin that you\Nread in the basement. You speak Latin? Not well. Not since tenth grade. Weird how it all comes back. Well, it's a weird kind of night. I'm sorry about tonight. Everybody.. Do I lose points if I tell\Nyou I'm having a pretty nice time? No. You can tell me that. What are you running away for? Don't spill on me! Did I get a little beer on your shirt? I guess it'll have to come off, huh? Not here. Baby, come on. We're all alone. I'm chilly. Okay, guys. That's it.\NLet's go. We've got a job to do. Your basic human needs disgust me.\NGet out of here. - Do we have temperature\Ncontrol in this sector? - On it. Engaging pheromone mists. It's so dark. Take me inside? Come on. This is why we came here. It's romantic. Okay, baby. Let's see some boobies. Show us the goods. Does it really matter if we see her.. We're not the only ones watching, kid. Gotta keep the customer satisfied. You understand what's at stake, here? Score. Jules! This we offer in humility and fear. For the blessed peace\Nof your eternal slumber. As it ever was. As it ever was. Nemo, man, you gotta wake up.\NYour shit is topsy-turvy. I'm gonna go for a walk. Okay. I swear to fucking God,\Nsomebody is talking. Or I'm pretty sure someone is. I'm gonna go for a walk. Enough! What are you saying? What do you want? You think I'm a puppet, huh? You think I'm a puppet.\NGonna do a little.. fucking puppet dance! I'm the boss of my own brain,\Nso give it up. I'm gonna go for a walk. I don't wanna.. I mean, I've never.. I don't mean "never".. Hey. Nothing you don't want. He's got a husband bulge. I thought there'd be stars. We are abandoned. - Fuck!\N- Fucking run! Curt! Dead bitch! Jesus, what happened? The fuck! Curt, what the fuck? Where are you hurt? Is all of this from you? It's okay! Curt, you're okay! Where's Jules? She's gone. We've gotta get out of here. No. No. Dana, don't open that.. I'm not leaving here without Jules. That dead girl's out there! Dana, come on! What is that thing? Fuck! I don't know,\Nbut there's more of them. More of them? I saw a young girl. All zombied like him.. but she was missing an arm. Oh, my God. Patience. The diary. - We gotta lock this place down.\N-He's right. We'll go room by room.\NBarricade every window and door. We gotta play it safe. No matter what\Nhappens, we have to stay together. Fuck! Calm down. Watch the master work. This isn't right. What? What's the matter? This isn't right. We should split up. We can cover more ground that way. Yeah. Yeah. Good idea. Really? All right,\Nyou guys, get in your rooms. Lock them in. What the fuck? What the..? What the fuck? That's not good. Out of the way. Out of the way.\NOut of the way. Chem department,\NI need 500 CCs of Thorazine.. pumped into room three. No, no, no. Stand by, Chem. Judah Buckner to the rescue. What the fuck? Fuck! What the fuck? Oh, my God. I'm on a reality TV show. My parents are gonna\Nthink I'm such a burnout. Help me! Help me! Must be getting excited downstairs. Greatest show on Earth. Somebody help! Come on! Use the bed!\N- Come on! Come on! It's empty.\N- Go. Curt?\N- Unlock the door. I can't. Get down to the basement. This is the black room. Nice. From the diary. This is where he killed them. This is where he kills us. No way. No. He's not gonna kill us We just gotta find a door. Okay? Let's just check the walls, okay? Curt? I mean, there's gotta be.. You like pain? How's that work for you? These fucking zombies. Remember when you could\Njust throw a girl in a volcano? How old do you think I am? Let's move! Come on! Come on! Go! What about Marty? They got him. The devil is defeated. Now Kiko's spirit will\Nlive in the happy frog! Fuck you! Fuck you! Fuck you! Fuck you! - You seeing this?\N- Perfect record, huh? The Japan crew should've\Nhad this in the bag. They fucked us. How hard is it to kill nine-year-olds? Zero fatality. Total wash. You want good product,\Nyou gotta buy American. Any word from downstairs? Downstairs doesn't care about Japan.\NThe director trusts us. You just sweat the chem, Lin. While these morons are singing\NWhat a Friend We Have in Shinto.. we are bringing the pain. Yeah, and what the fuck's\Nup with this guy's pot, anyway? He's supposed to be drooling\Nand instead he almost makes us? We treated the shit out of it. Okay, we've got the Rambler\Nheading toward the tunnel. The fool's toast anyway. And so are we if you\Ndon't get this under control. Shit.\N- What? "Shit" why? Gotta go. Work to do. You guys are humanity's last hope.\NIf the ancients rise.. There's no cave-in.\N- What? The fucking tunnel's open! Control to Demolition. We're dark on the whole sector. Try to bypass it. - What the fuck do you think I'm doing?\N-Open the door. Look out!\NGet out of the way! Make a hole! What the fuck's going on?\N- We don't know. Electrical said there\Nwas a glitch up top. That tunnel should've blown hours ago.\N-We didn't get the order. Hadley, what is going on? Hadley? Why hasn't the tunnel blown? No, no. No fucking way! Can't believe this, man.\NThis ain't happening. It's right there. All right.\NWe got any climbing gear? Ropes? Yeah. In my fucking dorm room. We can't go back. There's no way across. What're we gonna do? Jump? Dude. What? Curt, are you sure about this? I've done bigger jumps than this. You've got a smooth run.. and maybe a five foot\Ndifferential on the other side. But you've gotta give it everything. Curt. Look, you guys,\Nyou stay in the Rambler. I'll get help. If I wipe out,\NI'll fucking limp for help. But I'm coming back here. I'm coming back with\Ncops and choppers.. and large fucking guns,\Nand those things are gonna pay. For Jules. Don't hold back. Never do. No! Curt! Oh, God! He hit something.\NThere's nothing. What'd he hit? Puppeteers. Marty was right. Get in the van. Dana. Marty was right. You're going back. I'm going through. And we'll just drive.\NThere's gotta be another road. Another way out of here.\N-It won't work. Something will happen.\NIt will collapse, it will wash away. Then we just leave\Nthe roads altogether. Drive as far as we can into the\Nforest and we go on foot from there. You're missing the point. Please, do not go nuts on me,\Nokay, Dana? You're all I've got, now. I'm okay. Good, okay, 'cause I need you calm. Okay, no matter what happens,\Nwe gotta stay.. Goddamn, that was close! Yeah, photo-fucking-finish. I don't understand. You're celebrating? They're celebrating. I'm drinking. But she's still alive. How can the ritual be complete? The virgin's death is optional,\Nas long as it's last. Main thing is that she suffers. That she did. It's so strange. I'm actually rooting for this girl. She's got so much heart. And you think of\Nall the pain and the.. Tequila is my lady! My lady! Come on in, guys!\NCome on in. You're welcome. Tequila!\NFrom darkness, there is light! I wish that I could do what you do. Oh, my God.\N-Yeah, it's masterful. I don't know.\NTonight was solid. I don't know. Are you kidding? Classic denouement.\NWhen the van hits the lake.. I screamed. And the water rushing in,\Nand the zombies.. just think it would've\Nbeen cooler with a merman. Do you know if we get\Nthe overtime bonus on this one? Accounting's over there. Ask them. I don't need to.\NI already know the answer. I'm an intern. So I don't qualify for OT. It's funny that you like the ballet.. because I happen to have\Ntwo tickets to your favorite.. You knuckleheads. You almost gave me a\Nheart attack with that tunnel. Like I said, it wasn't our fault.\NWe didn't get the order. I'm just giving you a hard time. Come on. Give us a hug. No, seriously. That wasn't our fault. There was a glitch.\NPower re-route from upstairs. What do you mean, upstairs? Turn the fucking music off. Hello? That's impossible. Everything\Nwas done within the guidelines. The virgin's the only one.. No. I am not doubting you. Which one? Marty.\N-Hi. Dana, come on. Marty. Wait. We're going in the grave? Dana, come on! What is this place? Yeah. I had to dismember\Nthat guy with a trowel. What have you been up to? Nobody else, huh? Yeah, I figured. You figured everything. Oh, not at all. But, I do know some stuff. As in.. It's an elevator. Somebody sent those dead\Nfucks up here to get us. Now, there's no controls inside, but\Nthere's maintenance overrides in there. And I think I can get it to go down. Do we wanna go down? Where else are we gonna go? Come on. Get in. Come on! Fucking zombie arm. Oh, shit. We chose. What? What? Fuck! All that shit we were playing with. They made us choose. They made us choose how we die. We saw them go down the access drop.\NThey have to be in one of these. Internal security can.. I don't care if it's not protocol.\NAre you fucking high? It's the fool! Do not touch the girl. If he outlives her,\Nthis whole thing goes to hell. Take him out first. Cleanup says the prep team\Nmissed one of the kid's stashes. Whatever he's been smoking's\Nbeen immunizing him to all our shit. How does that help us right now? What? No, if you have a confirmed kill,\Ntake her out, too. There. 3606. Gotcha. Bring 'em down. Step out of the elevator!\NStep out of the elevator! Why are you trying to kill us?\N- Step out! Just the girl! What? -Just me? Do it! Good work, zombie arm. You shouldn't be here. This should've gone differently. Ended more quickly. I can only imagine\Nyour pain and confusion. But know this. What's happening to you\Nis part of something bigger. Something older than anything known. You've seen horrible things. An army of nightmare creatures. But they are nothing\Ncompared to what came before. What lies below. It's our task to placate\Nthe ancient ones. As it's yours to\Nbe offered up to them. Forgive us. And let us get it over with. Come on. Go in that room. Army of nightmares, huh? Let's get this party started. Hold fire! Oh, shit. Go! Go! Go! Lead officer Truman\Nto security command. Requesting immediate reinforcements.\NCode black. I repeat, code black. Where the fuck are you guys? Sector 12, down. Sector 8, down. Sector 3, down. Jesus Christ! Why aren't the defenses working?\NWhere's the fucking gas? Something chewed through the\Nconnections in the utility shaft. Something which?\N- Something scary! The north exit is blocked.\NYou can't go there. Go, go, go! Fuck! We're running out of time! It's on lockdown,\NI'm trying to bypass. Hadley! Oh, come on! It's you. No, no, no. Please, please. Kill him. Okay, Dana, come on. Dana. Here. It's easier with this. Look at these. Five of them. What are they? Us. I should have seen it like you did. This is part of a ritual. A ritual sacrifice? Great. You tie someone to a stone, get a\Nfancy dagger and a bunch of robes. Is that that complicated?\N- No. It's simple. They don't just want to see us killed. They want to see us punished. Punished for what? For being young. It's different in every culture. And it has changed over the years.. but it has always required youth. There must be at least five. The whore. She's corrupted. She dies first. The athlete. The scholar. The fool. All suffer and die at the hands of.. whatever horror they have raised.. leaving the last, to live or die.. .. as fate decides. The virgin. Me? Virgin? We work with what we have. But what if you don't pull it off? They rise. Who does? What's beneath us? The ancient ones. The gods that used to rule the Earth. As long as they accept\Nour sacrifice, they remain below. But the other rituals have all failed. The sun is coming up in eight minutes. If you live to see it,\Nthe world will end. Maybe that's the way it should be. If you've got to kill all\Nmy friends to survive.. maybe it's time for a change. We're not talking about change. We're talking about the agonizing death\Nof every human soul on the planet. Including you. You can die with them.. or you can die for them. Gosh, they're both so enticing. The whole world, Marty. Is in your hands, Dana. There is no other way. You have to be strong. Yeah, Dana.. you feeling strong? I'm sorry. So am I. Marty.. Marty! Hey. You know.. I don't think Curt even has a cousin. How are you? Going away. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry I almost shot you. I probably wouldn't have. Hey, no. No. I totally get it. I'm sorry I let you get attacked by\Na werewolf and then ended the world. No. Hey, you were right. Humanity... It's time to give\Nsomeone else a chance. Giant evil gods. I wish I could've seen them. I know. That would have been a fun weekend. Subtitled by: Freaky.
