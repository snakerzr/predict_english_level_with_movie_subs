If you don't mind me saying,\Nif that don't work, your breath\Ncertainly will get the job done, 'cause you definitely\Nneed some Tic Tacs or something,\N'cause your breath stinks!

Can I stay with you, please? - Of course!\N- Really? - No.\N- Please! I don't wanna go back there! You don't know what it's like to be\Nconsidered a freak. Well, maybe you do. But that's why we gotta stick together.\NYou gotta let me stay! - Please! Please!\N- Okay! Okay! - But one night only.\N- Ah! Thank you! - What are you-- No! No!\N- This is gonna be fun! We can stay up late,\Nswapping manly stories, and in the morning\NI'm making waffles. - Oh!\N- Where do, uh, I sleep? Outside! Oh, well,\NI guess that's cool. I mean, I don't know you,\Nand you don't know me, so I guess outside\Nis best, you know. [Sniffles]\NHere I go. Good night.\N[Sighs] I mean, I do like the outdoors.\NI'm a donkey. I was born outside.

Now, tell me!\NWhere are the others? - Eat me!\N- [Grunts] I've tried to be fair\Nto you creatures. Now my patience has reached its end!\NTell me or I'll-- No, no, not the buttons.\NNot my gumdrop buttons. All right then.\NWho's hiding them? Okay, I'll tell you.\NDo you know the muffin man? - The muffin man?\N- The muffin man. Yes, I know the muffin man,\Nwho lives on Drury Lane? Well, she's married\Nto the muffin man. - The muffin man?\N- The muffin man! - She's married to the muffin man.\N- [Door Opens] My Lord! We found it. Then what are you waiting for?\NBring it in. [Man Grunting] - [Gasping]\N- Oh! - Magic mirror--\N- Don't tell him anything! No! - [Gingerbread Man Whimpers]\N- Evening. Mirror, mirror, on the wall. Is this not the most\Nperfect kingdom of them all? Well, technically\Nyou're not a king. Uh, Thelonius. - You were saying?\N- What I mean is, you're not a king yet. But you can become one. All\Nyou have to do is marry a princess. - Go on.\N- [Chuckles] So,just sit back\Nand relax, my Lord, because it's time for you to\Nmeet today's eligible bachelorettes. And here they are! Bachelorette number one\Nis a mentally abused shut-in\Nfrom a kingdom far, faraway. She likes sushi\Nand hot tubbing anytime. Her hobbies include cooking\Nand cleaning for her two evil sisters.

Thank you!\NThank you very much! I'm here till Thursday.\NTry the veal! Ha, ha! - [Shrek Laughs]\N- [Crowd Gasping, Murmuring] Shall I give\Nthe order, sir? No, I have a better idea. People of DuLoc,\NI give you our champion! - What?\N- Congratulations, ogre. You've won the honour of\Nembarking on a great and noble quest. Quest? I'm already on a quest,\Na quest to get my swamp back. - Your swamp?\N- Yeah, my swamp! Where you dumped\Nthose fairy tale creatures! - [Crowd Murmuring]\N- Indeed. All right, ogre,\NI'll make you a deal. Go on this quest for me, and\NI'll give you your swamp back. Exactly the way it was? Down to the last\Nslime-covered toad stool. - And the squatters?\N- As good as gone. What kind of quest? [Donkey] Let me get this straight.\NYou're gonna go fight a dragon... and rescue a princess just so Farquaad\Nwill give you back a swamp... which you only don't have\Nbecause he filled it full of\Nfreaks in the first place. - Is that about right?\N- Maybe there's a good reason\Ndonkeys shouldn't talk. I don't get it. Why don't you just\Npull some of that ogre stuff on him? Throttle him,\Nlay siege to his fortress, grind his bones to make your bread,\Nthe whole ogre trip. Oh, I know what. Maybe I could have\Ndecapitated an entire village... and put their heads\Non a pike, gotten a knife, cut open their\Nspleen and drink their fluids. Does that sound\Ngood to you? Uh, no, not really, no. For your information, there's a lot\Nmore to ogres than people think. - Example?\N- Example? - Okay, um, ogres are like onions.\N- [Sniffs] They stink? - Yes-- No!\N- They make you cry?\N- No! You leave them out in the sun,\Nthey get all brown, start\Nsprouting little white hairs. No! Layers! Onions have layers. Ogres have layers!\NOnions have layers. You get it? We both have layers.\N[Sighs] Oh, you both\Nhave layers. Oh. [Sniffs]\NYou know, not everybody likes onions. Cake! Everybody loves cakes!\NCakes have layers. I don't care...\Nwhat everyone likes. Ogres are not like cakes. You know what else\Neverybody likes? Parfaits. Have you ever met a person, you\Nsay, Let's get some parfait, they say, No,\NI don't like no parfait? - Parfaits are delicious.\N- No! You dense, irritating,\Nminiature beast of burden! Ogres are like onions!\NEnd of story. Bye-bye. See ya later. Parfaits may be the most delicious thing\Non the whole damn planet. You know, I think\NI preferred your humming. Do you have a tissue or something?\NI'm making a mess. Just the word parfait\Nmake me start slobbering. I'm on my way from misery\Nto happiness today Uh-huh, uh-huh\NUh-huh, uh-huh I'm on my way from misery\Nto happiness today Uh-huh, uh-huh\NUh-huh, uh-huh And everything\Nthat you receive up yonder Is what you give to me\Nthe day I wander I'm on my way I'm on my way I'm on my way Ooh! Shrek!\NDid you do that? You gotta warn somebody before you\Njust crack one off. My mouth was open. Believe me, Donkey, if\Nit was me, you'd be dead. [Sniffs]\NIt's brimstone. - We must be getting close.\N- Yeah, right, brimstone. Don't be talking about it's\Nthe brimstone. I know what I\Nsmell. It wasn't no brimstone. It didn't come off\Nno stone neither. [Rumbling] Sure, it's big enough,\Nbut look at the location. [Laughing] Uh, Shrek? Uh, remember when\Nyou said ogres have layers? Oh, aye. Well, I have a bit\Nof a confession to make. Donkeys don't have layers. We wear\Nour fear right out there on our sleeves. - Wait a second.\NDonkeys don't have sleeves.\N- You know what I mean. You can't tell me\Nyou're afraid of heights. I'm just a little uncomfortable\Nabout being on a rickety bridge\Nover a boiling lake of lava! Come on, Donkey.\NI'm right here beside ya, okay? For emotional support, we'll just tackle this thing\Ntogether one little baby step at a time. - Really?\N- Really, really. - Okay, that makes me\Nfeel so much better.\N-Just keep moving. - And don't look down.\N- Okay, don't look down.\NDon't look down. Don't look down.\NKeep on moving. Don't look down. [Gasps]\NShrek! I'm looking down! Oh, God, I can't do this!\NJust let me off, please! - But you're already halfway.\N- But I know that half is safe! Okay, fine. I don't\Nhave time for this. You go back. - Shrek, no! Wait!\N-Just, Donkey-- - Let's have a dance then, shall we?\N- Don't do that! Oh, I'm sorry. Do what? - Oh, this?\N- Yes, that! Yes? Yes, do it. Okay. [Screams]\NNo, Shrek! - No! Stop it!\N- You said do it! I'm doing it. I'm gonna die. I'm gonna die.\NShrek, I'm gonna die. Oh! That'll do, Donkey.\NThat'll do. Cool. [Donkey] So where is this\Nfire-breathing pain-in-the-neck anyway? Inside, waiting for us\Nto rescue her. [Chuckles]\NI was talking about the dragon, Shrek. [Water Dripping] [Wind Howling] [Donkey Whispering]\NYou afraid? No, but-- Shh. Oh, good. Me neither.\N[Gasps] 'Cause there's nothing\Nwrong with being afraid. Fear's a sensible response\Nto an unfamiliar situation. Unfamiliar dangerous\Nsituation, I might add. With a dragon that breathes fire\Nand eats knights and breathes fire, it sure doesn't mean you're a coward\Nif you're a little scared. I sure as heck am not a coward.\NI know that. [Gasps] Donkey, two things, okay? Shut... up. Now go over there and see\Nif you can find any stairs. Stairs? I thought\Nwe was looking for the princess. The princess will be up the stairs in\Nthe highest room in the tallest tower. - What makes you think she'll be there?\N- I read it in a book once. Cool. You handle the dragon.\NI'll handle the stairs. I'll find those stairs.\NI'll whip their butt too. Those stairs won't know\Nwhich way they're going. [Creaking] I'm gonna take drastic steps. Kick it to the kerb. Don't mess\Nwith me. I'm the stair master. I've mastered the stairs.\NI wish I had a step right here.\NI'd step all over it. Well, at least we know\Nwhere the princess is, but where's the-- Dragon!\N[Screams] [Gasps] [Roars] Donkey, look out!\N[Screams] [Screams] [Whimpering] - Got ya!\N- [Roars] [Gasps] [Shouts]\NWhoa! Whoa! Whoa! [Screaming] [Gasps] Oh! Aah! Aah! [Gasping] [Growls] No. Oh, no. No!\N[Screams] - Oh, what large teeth you have.\N- [Growls] I mean, white, sparkling teeth.\NI know you probably hear this\Nall the time from your food, but you must bleach, 'cause that\Nis one dazzling smile you got there. Do I detect a hint\Nof minty freshness? And you know what else?\NYou're-- You're a girl dragon! Oh, sure! I mean,\Nof course you're a girl dragon. You're just reeking\Nof feminine beauty. What's the matter with you?\NYou got something in your eye? Ooh. Oh. Oh. Man, I'd really love to stay,\Nbut, you know, I'm, uh-- [Coughs] I'm an asthmatic, and\NI don't know if it'd work out if\Nyou're gonna blow smoke rings. Shrek!\N[Gasps] [Whimpering]\NNo! Shrek! Shrek! Shrek! [Groans, Sighs] [Chorus Vocalising] [Vocalising Continues] [Vocalising Continues] Oh! Oh! - Wake up!\N- What? Are you Princess Fiona? I am, awaiting a knight\Nso bold as to rescue me. Oh, that's nice.\NNow let's go! But wait, Sir Knight. This be-ith our first meeting. Should it not be\Na wonderful, romantic moment? - Yeah, sorry, lady. There's no time.\N- Hey, wait. What are you doing? You should sweep me\Noff my feet... out yonder window and down a rope\Non to your valiant steed. You've had a lot of time\Nto plan this, haven't you? Mm-hmm.\N[Screams, Grunts] But we have to\Nsavour this moment! You could recite\Nan epic poem for me. A ballad? A sonnet! - A Limerick? Or something!\N- I don't think so. Can I at least know\Nthe name of my champion? Um, Shrek. Sir Shrek.\N[Clears Throat] I pray that you take this favour\Nas a token of my gratitude. Thanks! [Roaring] You didn't slay the dragon? - It's on my to-do list. Now come on!\N- [Screams] But this isn't right! You were meant to charge in,\Nsword drawn, banner flying. That's what all\Nthe other knights did. Yeah, right before\Nthey burst into flame. That's not the point. Oh! Wait. Where are you going?\NThe exit's over there. Well, I have to save my ass. What kind of knight are you? One of a kind. [Donkey]\NSlowdown. Slowdown, baby, please. I believe it's healthy to get to\Nknow someone over a long period of time. Just call me old-fashioned.\N[Laughs] I don't want to rush into\Na physical relationship. I'm not emotionally ready\Nfor a commitment of, uh, this-- Magnitude really is\Nthe word I'm looking for. Magnitude-- Hey, that is\Nunwanted physical contact. Hey, what are you doing? Okay, okay. Let's just backup a little\Nand take this one step a ta time. We really should get to know each other\Nfirst as friends or pen pals. I'm on theroada lot,\Nbut I just love receiving cards-- I'd really love\Nto stay, but-- Don't do that! That's my tail!\NThat's my personal tail. You're gonna tear it off.\NI don't give permission-- What\Nare you gonna do with that? Hey, now. No way.\NNo! No! No, no! No.\NNo, no, no! No! Oh! [Growls] [Roars] - [Roaring]\N- [Gasps] - Hi, Princess!\N- It talks! Yeah, it's getting him\Nto shut up that's the trick. [Screams] [Screaming] Oh! - [Thuds]\N- [Groans] [Shrek Groans] [Roars] [Roars] [Roaring] [Roars] Okay, you two,\Nhead for the exit! I'll take care of the dragon. [Echoing]\NRun! [Gasping] [Screaming] [Roaring] - [Screams]\N- [Roars] [Panting, Sighs] [Whimpers] [Roars] [Roars, Whimpers] - [Dragon Growling In The Distance]\N- You did it! You rescued me!\NYou're amazing. You're-- You're wonderful. You're... a little unorthodox I'll admit. But thy deed is great,\Nand thine heart is pure. - I am eternally in your debt.\N- [Clears Throat] And where would a brave knight be\Nwithout his noble steed? I hope you heard that. She called me\Na noble steed. She think I'm a steed. [Fiona Laughs]\NThe battle is won. You may remove your helmet,\Ngood Sir Knight. - Uh, no.\N- Why not? I have helmet hair. Please. I would'st look\Nupon the face of my rescuer. No, no, you wouldn't-- 'st. But how will you kiss me? What? That wasn't\Nin the job description. Maybe it's a perk. No, it's destiny.\NOh, you must know how it goes. A princess locked in a tower\Nand beset by a dragon... is rescued by a brave knight, and then they share\Ntrue love's first kiss. Hmm? With Shrek?\NYou think-- Wait. Wait. You think that\NShrek is your true love? Well, yes. - [Laughing]\N- [Laughing] You think Shrek\Nis your true love! What is so funny? Let's just say I'm\Nnot your type, okay? Of course, you are.\NYou're my rescuer. Now-- Now remove your helmet. Look. I really don't think\Nthis is a good idea. -Just take off the helmet.\N- I'm not going to. - Take it off.\N- No! - Now!\N- Okay! Easy. As you command,\NYour Highness. You-- You're a-- an ogre. Oh, you were expecting\NPrince Charming. Well, yes, actually. Oh, no. This is all wrong. You're not supposed\Nto be an ogre. [Sighs] Princess, I was sent\Nto rescue you by Lord Farquaad, okay? He's the one\Nwho wants to marry you. Then why didn't\Nhe come rescue me? Good question. You should\Nask him that when we get there. But I have to be rescued\Nby my true love, not by some ogre\Nand his-- his pet. So much for noble steed. You're not making\Nmy job any easier. I'm sorry, but your job\Nis not my problem. You can tell Lord Farquaad\Nthat if he wants to rescue me properly, I'll be waiting for him\Nright here. Hey! I'm no one's messenger boy,\Nall right? I'm a delivery boy. You wouldn't dare. - Put me down!\N- Ya coming, Donkey? I'm right behind ya. Put me down, or you will\Nsuffer the consequences! This is not dignified!\NPut me down! [Screams] Okay, so here's\Nanother question. Say there's a woman\Nthat digs you, right, but you\Ndon't really like her that way. How do you let her down real easy\Nso her feelings aren't hurt, but you don't get burned\Nto a crisp and eaten? You just tell her\Nshe's not your true love. Everyone knowest what happens\Nwhen you find your-- Hey!\N[Sighs] The sooner we get\Nto DuLoc the better. You're gonna love it there,\NPrincess. It's beautiful! And what of my groom-to-be?\NLord Farquaad? What's he like? Let me put it this way,\NPrincess. Men of Farquaad's stature\Nare in short supply. [Laughs] I don't know. There are those who\Nthink little of him. [Both Laughing] Stop it. Stop it,\Nboth of you. You're just jealous you can\Nnever measure up to a great\Nruler like Lord Farquaad. Yeah, well, maybe\Nyou're right, Princess. But I'll let you do the measuring\Nwhen you see him tomorrow. Tomorrow?\NIt'll take that Ion? - Shouldn't we stop to make camp?\N- No, that'll take longer. - We can keep going.\N- But there's robbers in the woods. Whoa! Time out, Shrek!\NCamping is starting to sound good. Hey, come on.\NI'm scarier than anything we're\Ngoing to see in this forest. I need to find\Nsomewhere to camp now! [Bird Wings Fluttering] [Grunting] - Hey! Over here.\N- Shrek, we can do better than that. I don't think\Nthis is fit for a princess. No, no, it's perfect.\NIt just needs a few homey touches. - Homey touches? Like what?\N- [Crashing] A door? Well, gentlemen,\NI bid thee good night. You want me to read you\Na bedtime story? I will. I said good night! Shrek, what are you doing? [Laughs]\NI just-- You know-- Oh, come on. I was just kidding. [Fire Crackling] And, uh, that one,\Nthat's Throwback, the only ogre to ever spit\Nover three wheat fields. Right. Yeah. Hey, can you tell my future\Nfrom these stars? The stars don't tell the future, Donkey.\NThey tell stories. Look, there's BITNET,\Nthe Fitment. - You can guess what he's famous for.\N- I know you're making this up. No, look.\NThere he is, and there's the group of hunters\Nrunning away from his stench. That is nothing but\Na bunch of little dots. Sometimes things are\Nmore than they appear. Hmm? Forget it. [Sighs] Hey, Shrek, what we gonna do\Nwhen we get our swamp anyway? Our swamp? You know, when we're through\Nrescuing the princess. We? Donkey, there's no we.\NThere's no our. There's just me and my swamp. The first thing I'm gonna do is build\Na ten-foot wall around my land. You cut me deep, Shrek. You cut me real deep just now. You know what I think? I think this whole wall thing\Nis just a way to keep somebody out. - No, do ya think?\N- Are you hiding something? Never mind, Donkey. Oh, this is another one of\Nthose onion things, isn't it? No, this is one of those drop-it\Nand leave-it-alone things. - Why don't you want to talk about it?\N- Why do you want to? - Why are you blocking?\N- I'm not blocking. - Oh, yes, you are.\N- Donkey, I'm warning you. - Who you trying to keep out?\N- Everyone! Okay? Oh, now we're getting somewhere. Oh! For the love of Pete! What's your problem?\NWhat you got against the whole world? I'm not the one\Nwith the problem, okay? It's the world that seems\Nto have a problem with me. People take one look at me\Nand go, Aah! Help! Run! A big, stupid, ugly ogre! [Sighs] They judge me before\Nthey even know me. That's why\NI'm better off alone. You know what? When we met, I didn't think you was\Njust a big, stupid, ugly ogre. Yeah, I know. So, uh, are there\Nany donkeys up there? Well, there's, um, Gabby, the Small and Annoying. Okay, I see it now. The big shiny\None, right there. That one there? - That's the moon.\N- Oh, okay. [Orchestra] [Dulcimer] [Farquaad]\NAgain. Show me again. [Music Stops, Rewinds] Mirror, mirror, show her to me.\NShow me the princess. <i>- Hmph.\N- [Rewinds, Resumes]</i> Ah.

We kind of got off\Nto a bad start yesterday. I wanted to make it up to you. After all, you did rescue me. - Uh, thanks.\N- [Sniffs] Well, eat up.\NWe've got a big day ahead of us. - [Belches]\N- Shrek! What? It's a compliment. Better out than in,\NI always say. [Laughs] - Well, it's no way to behave\Nin front of a princess.\N- [Belches] - Thanks.\N- She's as nasty as you are. [Laughs] You know,\Nyou're not exactly what I expected. Maybe you shouldn't judge people\Nbefore you get to know them. [Vocalising] [Man]\NLa Liberte! Hey! Princess! - [Laughs]\N- What are you doing? Be still, Mon Cherie,\Nfor I am your saviour!

Um, I, uh-- - I guess we better move on.\N- Sure. But, Shrek? - I'm-- I'm worried about Donkey.\N- [Blubbering] - What?\N- I mean, look at him. - He doesn't look so good.\N- What are you talking about? I'm fine.

'Cause\NI told Shrek those rats was a bad idea. - You are what you eat, I said. Now--\N- No. I-- I've been this way\Nas Ion as I can remember. What do you mean? Look,\NI am not never seen you like this before. It only happens\Nwhen the sun goes down. By night one way,\Nby day another. This shall be the norm... until you find\Ntrue love's first kiss... and then\Ntake love's true form. Ah, that's beautiful.\NI didn't know you wrote poetry. It's a spell. [Sighs]\NWhen I was a little girl, a witch cast a spell\Non me. Every night I become this. This horrible, ugly beast! I was placed in a tower to await the day\Nmy true love would rescue me. That's why I have to marry\NLord Farquaad tomorrow... before the sun sets\Nand he sees me... like this.\N[Sobs] All right, all right. Calm down.\NLook, it's not that bad. You're not that ugly.\NWell, I am not gonna lie. You are ugly. But you only look like this at night.\NShrek's ugly 24-7. But, Donkey,\NI'm a princess, and this is not how a princess\Nis meant to look. Princess, how 'bout if you\Ndon't marry Farquaad? I have to. Only my true love's kiss\Ncan break the spell. But, you know, um,\Nyou're kind of an ogre, and Shrek-- well,\Nyou got a lot in common. Shrek? Princess, I--\NUh, how's it going, first of all? Good?\NUm, good for me too. I'm okay. I saw this flower and thought of you\Nbecause it's pretty and-- well, I don't really like it,\Nbut I thought you might like it\N'cause you're pretty. But I like you anyway.\NI'd-- uh, uh-- [Sighs] I'm in trouble.\NOkay, here we go. [Fiona]\NI can't just marry whoever want. Take a good look\Nat me, Donkey. I mean, really, who could ever love a beast\Nso hideous and ugly? Princessand ugly\Ndon't go together. - That's why I can't\Nstay here with Shrek.\N- [Gasps] My only chance to live happily\Never after is to marry my truelove. - [Deep Sigh]\N- Don't you see, Donkey? That's just how\Nit has to be. It's the only way\Nto break the spell. - You at least gotta\Ntell Shrek the truth.\N- No! You can't breathe a word.\NNo one must ever know. What's the point of being able to talk\Nif you gotta keep secrets? Promise you won't tell.\NPromise! All right, all right.\NI won't tell him. But you should. I just know before this is over,\NI'm gonna need a whole lot\Nof serious therapy. - Look at my eye twitching.\N- [Door Opens] [Snoring] [Fiona]\NI tell him, I tell him not.

I-- I don't--\NThere's something I have to tell you. You don't have to tell me\Nanything, Princess. - I heard enough last night.\N- You heard what I said? Every word. I thought you'd understand. Oh, I understand. Like you said, Who could\Nlove a hideous, ugly beast? But I thought that\Nwouldn't matter to you. Yeah? Well, it does. [Gasps, Sighs] - Ah, right on time.\N- [Horse Whinnies] Princess, I've brought you\Na little something. [Fanfare] [Yawns]\NWhat'd I miss? What'd I miss? [Muffled] Who said that?\NCouldn't have been a donkey. Princess Fiona. As promised.\NNow hand it over. Very well, ogre. The deed\Nto your swamp, cleared out, as agreed. Take it and go\Nbefore I change my mind. Forgive me, Princess,\Nfor startling you, but you startled me, for I have never seen\Nsuch a radiant beauty before. I am Lord Farquaad. Lord Farquaad?\NOh, no, no. - [Snaps Fingers]\N- Forgive me, my Lord,\Nfor I was just saying... a short... farewell. That is so sweet. You don't have\Nto waste good manners on the ogre. It's not like\Nit has feelings. No, you're right.\NIt doesn't. Princess Fiona, beautiful, fair,\Nflawless Fiona. - I ask your hand in marriage.\N- [Gasps] Will you be the perfect bride\Nfor the perfect groom? Lord Farquaad, I accept.\NNothing would make-- Excellent! I'll start the plans,\Nfor tomorrow we wed! No! I mean, uh, why wait? Let's get married today\Nbefore the sun sets.

I would think, of all people, you would\Nrecognise a wall when you see one. Well, yeah. But the wall's supposed\Nto go around my swamp, not through it. It is around your half. See,\Nthat's your half, and this is my half. Oh! Your half. Hmm. Yes, my half.\NI helped rescue the princess. I did half the work,\NI get half the booty. Now hand me that big old rock,\Nthe one that looks like your head. - Back off!\N- No, you back off. - This is my swamp!\N- Our swamp. - Let go, Donkey!\N- You let go. - Stubborn jackass!\N- Smelly ogre.

So you just shut up\Nand pay attention! You are mean to me. You insult me and you don't\Nappreciate anything that I do! You're always pushing me around\Nor pushing me away. Oh, yeah? Well, if I treated you\Nso bad, how come you came back? Because that's what friends do!\NThey forgive each other! Oh, yeah.\NYou're right, Donkey. I forgive you...\Nfor stabbing me in the back! Ohh! You're so wrapped up\Nin layers, onion boy, you're\Nafraid of your own feelings. - Go away!\N- There you are, doing it again\Njust like you did to Fiona. All she ever do was like you,\Nmaybe even love you. Love me? She said I was ugly,\Na hideous creature. I heard the two of you\Ntalking. She wasn't talking about you. She was talking about, uh,\Nsomebody else. She wasn't talking\Nabout me? Well, then who was\Nshe talking about? Uh-uh, no way. I am not saying anything.\NYou don't wanna listen to me. - Right? Right?\N- Donkey! - No!\N- Okay, look. I'm sorry, all right? Hmph. [Sighs]\NI'm sorry. I guess I am just a big,\Nstupid, ugly ogre. Can you forgive me? Hey, that's what friends\Nare for, right? Right. Friends? Friends. So, um, what did Fiona\Nsay about me? What are you asking me for?\NWhy don't you just go ask her? The wedding!\NWe'll never make it in time. Ha-ha-ha!

It's a little late for that,\Nso if you'll excuse me-- - But you can't marry him.\N- And why not? Because-- Because he's just\Nmarrying you so he can be king.
