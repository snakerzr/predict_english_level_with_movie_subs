<i>What am I doing</i>\N<i>with my life?</i> <i>I'm so pale.</i>\N<i>I should get out more.</i> <i>I should eat better.</i> <i>My posture is terrible.</i>\N<i>I should stand up straight.</i> <i>People would respect me e</i>\N<i>if I stood up straighter.</i> <i>What's wrong with me?</i>\N<i>I just want to connect.</i> <i>Why can't I connect</i>\N<i>with people?</i> <i>Oh, right.</i>\N<i>It's because I'm dead.</i> <i>I shouldn't be</i>\N<i>so hard on myself.</i> <i>I mean, we're all dead.</i> <i>This girl is dead.</i>\N<i>That guy's dead.</i> <i>That guy in the corner</i>\N<i>is definitely dead.</i> <i>Jesus, these guys look awful.</i> <i>I wish I could</i>\N<i>introduce myself,</i> <i>but I don't remember</i>\N<i>my name anymore.</i> <i>I mean, I think</i>\N<i>it started with an "R,"</i> <i>but that's all I have left.</i> <i>I can't remember my name,</i>\N<i>or my parents, or my job.</i> <i>Although my hoodie would</i>\N<i>suggest I was unemployed.</i> <i>Sometimes I look</i>\N<i>at the others</i> <i>and try to imagine</i>\N<i>what they were.</i> <i>You were a janitor.</i> <i>You were the rich son</i>\N<i>of a corporate CEO.</i> <i>You were</i>\N<i>a personal trainer.</i> <i>And now you're a Corpse.</i> <i>I have a hard time</i>\N<i>piecing together</i> <i>how this whole</i>\N<i>apocalypse thing happened.</i> <i>Could have been</i>\N<i>chemical warfare</i> <i>or an airborne virus,</i> <i>or a radioactive</i>\N<i>outbreak monkey.</i> <i>But it doesn't really matt.</i>\N<i>This is what we are now.</i> <i>This is a typical day</i>\N<i>for me.</i> <i>I shuffle around,</i>\N<i>occasionally</i>\N<i>bumping into people,</i> <i>unable to apologize</i>\N<i>or say much of anything.</i> <i>It must have been</i>\N<i>so much better before,</i> <i>when everyone could</i>\N<i>express themselves,</i> <i>and communicate</i>\N<i>their feelings</i> <i>and just enjoy</i>\N<i>each other's company.</i> <i>A lot of us have</i>\N<i>made our home here</i>\N<i>at this airport.</i> <i>I don't know why.</i> <i>People wait at airports,</i>\N<i>I guess,</i> <i>but I'm not sure</i>\N<i>what we're all waiting for.</i> <i>Oh, man.

Stop,</i>\N<i>don't pick at it!</i>\N<i>You're making it worse!</i> <i>Oh, this is what</i>\N<i>I have to look forward to.</i> <i>It's kind of a bummer.</i> <i>I don't want to be this wa.</i> <i>I'm lonely.

USA! Let's go. Sweet. Hey, Berg, you gonna\Nhelp us out or what? No dice.\NAlmost at level five. Did you hear that? I did. We should bail. Oh, hey,\Nwe can't just bail.\NWe have orders. Do you have any idea\Nhow much medicine the City goes\Nthrough a month? We need pharma salvage\Nto survive. We can't just\Nabandon our...\NYou sound just like my dad. Thank you. Yeah, it wasn't\Na compliment. Oh, here, guys.\NTake some Prozac. Maybe that will\Ncheer you up. I told you\NI heard something. Per, let's bail. Perry? We have orders, Jules. It was nothing anyway. You're being\Nparanoid, okay?\NPerry! Aim for their heads! Smile, mother... <i>Nice watch.</i> <i>Now, I'm not</i>\N<i>proud of this.</i> <i>In fact,</i>\N<i>I'd appreciate it</i> <i>if you might look away</i>\N<i>for a moment here.</i> <i>I don't like hurting peo,</i>\N<i>but this is the world no.</i> <i>The new hunger</i>\N<i>is a very powerful thing.</i> <i>If I don't eat all of him,</i>\N<i>if I spare his brain,</i> <i>he'll rise up and become</i>\N<i>a Corpse like me.</i> <i>But if I do,</i>\N<i>I get his memories,</i> <i>his thoughts,</i>\N<i>his feelings.</i> <i>I'm sorry,</i>\N<i>I just can't help it.</i> <i>The brain's</i>\N<i>the best part.</i> <i>The part that makes me</i>\N<i>feel human again.</i> You like it, Perry? <i>I don't</i>\N<i>want to hurt you.</i> <i>I just want to feel</i>\N<i>what you felt.</i> <i>To feel a little better.</i> <i>A little less dead.</i> Perry...\NI think I love you. Say something. Don't just say nothing. No, I, um... I think\NI love you too, Julie. I miss airplanes. My mom used to say that\Nit looked like an Etch A Sketch up there. I like that you remember\Nthat kind of stuff. If we don't, then\Nit will just all\Nbe gone. You know? Yeah. The world is\Nso messed up. Not all of it. Cheeseball. Perry? Perry! Perry, where are you?\NAnswer me! Julie... J-Julie... Safe. Come... What? <i>I don't know</i>\N<i>what I'm doing.</i>\N<i>What's wrong with me?</i> <i>These other guys</i>\N<i>would never bring</i>\N<i>a living person home.</i> <i>You know why?</i>\N<i>Because that's crazy!</i> <i>Right now, they think</i>\N<i>she's just another</i>\N<i>one of us.</i> <i>A new addition</i>\N<i>to the family.</i> <i>But they would think</i>\N<i>I was insane.</i> <i>Why do I have</i>\N<i>to be so weird?</i> <i>What am I doing?</i> Home... Not eat. Keep you safe. <i>Maybe I could have</i>\N<i>thought this through</i>\N<i>a little more.</i> <i>But I can tell</i>\N<i>when a girl</i>\N<i>needs her space.</i> <i>There's a lot of ways</i>\N<i>to get to know a person.</i> <i>Eating her dead</i>\N<i>boyfriend's brains</i> <i>is one of the more</i>\N<i>unorthodox methods, but...</i> It's a special occasion... A special occasion, sir? It's Mom's birthday. To Diane.\NTo Mom. Yeah. It's Mom's birthday.\NSo, Perry, Julie tells me you've been\Nworking in Agriculture. But tell me you would\Nnever consider going to work construction\Nwith your father. You know, on the wall\Nwe need good people. Um... Don't mind him, Per.\NDad's idea of saving\Nhumanity is to build a really\Nbig concrete box, put everyone in it, and then wait at the door\Nwith guns until we grow\Nold and die. Well, Julie, without the wall,\Nwe would be eating brains now instead of rice.\NDad... <i>This is</i>\N<i>the only way</i>\N<i>past the wall.</i> <i>Otherwise we get stopped.</i> Okay... Come on. It's not that bad.\NCome on. I haven't heard from him\Nin two days, Jules. He's on construction detail,\NPerry. He's working. My dad goes weeks\Nwithout checking in. Okay. This way. Hey. It's gonna be okay. Dad. Per. Whoa, whoa, hey, hey, hey! Perry! Come on! <i>No wonder</i>\N<i>she's so afraid of me.</i> <i>I need</i>\N<i>a different approach.</i> <i>Okay, here we go.</i>\N<i>Don't be creepy.</i> <i>Don't be creepy.</i>\N<i>Don't be creepy.</i> What are you doing? Please leave me alone. Why me? Why did you save me? Don't c-cry. Safe. Keep you safe. What are you? I'm hungry. Just let me go! Not safe. Not safe? Uh-huh. Not safe. Well, then you're just\Ngonna have to go and get me some food. Because I'm starved. Please? I'd be very grateful\Nfor some food. O-okay. God! Shit. Don't r-run. Come. S-safe. Thank you. Be dead. Okay? That's too m-much. Told you not s-safe. Yeah, I get that. I really am hungry, though. Yes! Mmm. My God. <i>Oh, no. Stop staring.</i>\N<i>You're acting weird again.</i> Thank you. Oh, my God. Mmm! Oh, man. I can't remember\Nthe last time\NI had a beer. I guess you can't be\Nall that bad, Mr. Zombie. My name... You have a name? What is your name? Rrrrrrrrrrrrrr... Rrrr? <i>This date</i>\N<i>is not going well.</i> <i>I want to die</i>\N<i>all over again.</i> Rrrrrrr... Does your name\Nstart with "R"? Um... Robert? Richard? Randy? Raphael? Ricardo? Why don't I just\Ncall you "R"? I mean,\Nthat's a start, right? R... I want to go home, R. Mmm-mmm. It's n-not safe. I get that. And look... I know that\Nyou saved my life. And I'm grateful for that. But you walked me\Ninto this place. So I know that you can\Nwalk me out again. <i>Oh, no.</i>\N<i>She can't leave.</i>\N<i>She just got here.</i> <i>Tell her she has to wait.</i>\N<i>Tell her they'll notice.</i> H-h-have to wait. They... They'll notice. <i>Huh. Not bad.</i> How long? F-f-few d-days. Th-they'll f-forget. Y-y-you'll be o-kay. Are there others\Nlike you? I mean, I've... I've never ever heard\Na Corpse talk before. I mean,\Napart from the groaning. Okay. A few days, huh? What am I supposed\Nto do for a few days\Naround here anyway? This is awesome! You wanna try? Oh, God! Oh! You're a leadfoot. Okay. Okay. Pick a foot. You're using two feet.\NPick one foot... There you go. Okay... There you go. All right. Two hands\Non the wheel, buddy. Jesus, R! This was a beautiful car! <i>Recalculating.</i> What's with\Nall the vinyl? Couldn't figure out\Nhow to work an iPod? Better s-sound. Oh, you're a purist, huh? More alive. Yeah. That's true.\NLot more trouble, though. There you go again.\NShrugging. Stop shrugging, shrugger. It's a very\Nnon-committal gesture. Really? These are really cool records.\NHow did you get all these? I collect things. Yeah, I can see that.\NYou, my friend,\Nare a hoarder. There's this awesome\Nrecord store on Main\Nand Ivy. You would love it.\NIt's so cool. Was so cool. Alrighty... Much better. R? Can I ask you\Nsomething? My boyfriend,\Nhe died back there. Will he come back?\NAs one of you? That's good, I guess. Something happened to him. A lot of things\Nhappened to him. But I guess there just\Ncame a point where he couldn't\Nabsorb any more. It's just, in my world,\Npeople die all the time. So... You know,\Nit's not like I'm not sad\Nthat he's gone. Because I am. But I think I've been preparing for it\Nfor a really long time. What are you? <i>Man, it must be nice</i>\N<i>to sleep. I wish I could.</i> <i>I wish I could dream.</i> <i>But that's not really</i>\N<i>an option for me.</i> <i>The dead don't dream.</i>\N<i>This is as close as we g.</i> You sure\Nabout this, son? Welcome, then. Sorry for your loss. Me, too. Give him one\Nand show him\Nhow to use it. Hey, Berg, you gonna\Nhelp us out or what? I'm almost at level five. Did you hear that? I did. We should bail. We can't just bail.\NWe have orders. You sound\Njust like my dad. Thank you. Yeah, it wasn't\Na compliment. I told you\NI heard something. Perry! Aim for their heads. You said a few days.\NIt's been a few days, R. I have to go home. S-stay t-together. Safe. What? J-Julie. Living. Eat! Eat! Eat! Oh, my God! We go. Eat. R. Look. This way. Come with me. What? No! Want to help her. Who the hell asked you? Like her. It's okay. I'm sure it is. Over there, the garage.\NHold on. I'm so happy\Nto see you right now. You okay? Um... R? You drive. Good idea. <i>The white zone</i> <i>is for loading and unloag</i>\N<i>of passengers only.</i> Jesus, I'm freezing. I have to pull over. This is one of\Nthe last neighborhoods my dad evacuated. Maybe these houses\Nhave food. Okay, come on. Oh, man. It's locked. Ooh, God. Oh, cool! Look what they have. I haven't seen one of these\Nin forever. Cheese! It's all right. See? Yeah. It's important to preserve\Nmemories, you know? Especially now that\Nthe world is on\Nits way out. Everything you see,\Nyou may be seeing\Nfor the last time. Perry used to say that. Here. Take a picture. I'm exhausted. The bed actually\Nisn't too rotten, so I'm gonna go to sleep. Good night. Um... R? Y-yeah? I was...\NI was thinking... You know, you could\Nsleep in there if you want. On the floor. These houses\Ncreep me out, so... Okay. Do you feel it? Do you feel it? Hey,\Nlook up this street. Holy shit.\NThat's my dad. Get back! He would have\Nkilled you. If he saw you,\Nhe would have just\Nshot you in the head, and you'd just be gone. These clothes\Nare soaking still. I'm gonna\Nlay them out to dry. Oh, relax. <i>Holy shit.</i> Don't look. Okay. <i>Holy shit!</i> Hey. Do you have\Nto eat people? Y-yeah. Or you'll die? Yeah.\NBut you didn't eat me. You rescued me.\NLike, a bunch. It must be hard\Nbeing stuck in there. You know,\NI can see you trying. Maybe that's what\Npeople do. You know,\Nwe try to be better. Sometimes\Nwe kind of suck at it. But I look at you and you try so much harder\Nthan any human in my city. You're a good person, R. Anyway. It was me. What was you? Oh. I mean, I... I guess\NI kind of knew that. Y-you did? Yeah, I... I guess I hoped\Nthat you didn't. I'm sorry. Julie... I'm so s-sorry. Julie... <i>The dead do not sleep.</i> If you guys\Ncould pick any job\Nin the world... Pretend that everything\Nwas totally different, what would you want to do? Nursing.\NYeah? Yeah. Healing people and saving lives and... I don't know,\Nfinding a cure. I like that. I think someday\Nsomeone's gonna figure out\Nthis whole thing and exhume the whole world. Exhume?\NAnd what does that mean? Um, exhume means\Nto, like, revive. It means to dig up.\NAs in digging up a corpse. Whatever. What the hell\Nare you doing here? Are you actually\Ndreaming right now? I'm not sure. You can't dream, Corpse.\NDreaming is for humans. Chill out, Per.\NHe can dream\Nif he wants to. What about you, R? What do you want to be? I don't know.\NI don't even know\Nwhat I am. Well, you can be\Nwhatever you want. Isn't that\Nwhat they say? We can, right?\NYou and me? Mmm-hmm. It's not gonna happen,\Nloverboy. Not after you told her\Nyou ate her ex. Shrug. <i>So much for dreaming.</i> <i>You can't be</i>\N<i>whatever you want.</i> <i>All I'll ever be</i>\N<i>is a slow, pale,</i> <i>hunched-over,</i>\N<i>dead-eyed zombie.</i> <i>That she'd actually</i>\N<i>want to stay with me?</i> <i>It's hopeless.</i>\N<i>This is what I get</i>\N<i>for wanting more.</i> <i>I should just be happy</i>\N<i>with what I had.</i> <i>Things don't change.</i>\N<i>I need to accept that.</i> <i>It's easier not to feel.</i> <i>Then I wouldn't have to</i>\N<i>feel like this.</i> <i>d I've been alone</i>\N<i>too many nights</i> <i>d Too proud to tell you</i>\N<i>when you're right</i> <i>d A little patience</i>\N<i>would have helped me then</i> <i>d A lot like the break</i>\N<i>has been the common stand</i> <i>d All the angels above</i>\N<i>the earth I prayed</i> <i>d Send this message</i>\N<i>right into her head</i> <i>d There's certain things</i>\N<i>in life I cannot take</i> <i>d And I will wait</i> <i>d I hope you know I care</i> <i>d So cold</i>\N<i>I know you can't believet</i> <i>d Sometimes</i>\N<i>you gotta face the feeling</i> <i>d When you don't care</i>\N<i>if you get up again</i> <i>d There's a thousand this</i>\N<i>I will not understand</i> <i>d I hope you know I care</i> <i>d Now you're dealing with</i>\N<i>the hell I put you through</i> <i>d If I had my way I woule</i>\N<i>right there next to you</i> <i>d There's certain things</i>\N<i>in life you cannot change</i> <i>d There's certain things</i> Identify yourself!

I sent a half a dozen units\Nout looking for you. Nora said\Nyou were taken into... Yeah, I was.\NBut I escaped. I was holed up in a house\Nin the suburbs and then I found a car,\Nso I came here. Julie, are you sure\Nnothing bit you? Do I look infected\Nto you, Dad? We have to be safe. Yeah, I know. I know.\NI'm fine, though.\NI promise. I thought I lost you. Well, you didn't, Dad.\NI'm here. Welcome home. Yeah. Good to be back. <i>So I'm just gonna go home.</i>\N<i>I'm gonna blend in.</i> <i>I'm gonna stop</i>\N<i>thinking so much.</i> <i>I'm gonna</i>\N<i>forget about her,</i> <i>just like I forgot</i>\N<i>about everything else.</i> <i>I'm gonna...</i>\N<i>Oh, shit, am I cold?</i> <i>Is that what this is?</i>\N<i>Corpses don't get cold.</i> Yo! What are you\Ndoing here? Boneys.\NThey chased me out. Came to find you. Where is she? Went home. You okay? No. Bitches, man. Boneys looking for you. And her. You started something.

E-exhume. They said "Fuck, yeah!" Wait here. Be careful. Okay? So I'll wait here. It's not that bad.\NCome on. <i>Julie and I were</i>\N<i>giving the others hope.</i> <i>And it was</i>\N<i>spreading fast.</i> <i>I guess the Boneys</i>\N<i>didn't like that.</i> <i>That must be why</i>\N<i>they're looking for us.</i> <i>I have to tell Julie.</i> <i>before it's too late.</i>\N<i>I have to...</i> <i>Oh, no.

It's just a stupid name\Nthat we came up with for a state of being\Nthat we don't understand. Yeah. Oh, my God! What is wrong with me? Okay. I've got to\Ntell you something. This is kind of weird. Please do not\Nfreak out.\NNo. But I actually miss him. You... You miss him?\NI know, it's so stupid. Like you're\Nattracted to him?\NNo, I don't... Like he could be\Nyour boyfriend? Your zombie boyfriend? I mean, I know it's really\Nhard to meet guys right now with the apocalypse\Nand stuff, trust me. And look, I know\Nthat you miss Perry. Okay? But, Julie,\Nthis is weird. Like, I wish the Internet\Nwas still working so I could just look up whatever it is\Nthat's wrong with you. Shut up. All right. Okay. I'm getting\Nready for bed. Hey. I'm glad you're back. Yeah. Have sweet dreams\Nabout your zombie. All right. Julie. Julie! Oh, my God. R! What are you doing here? Came to see you. R... You can't just do that.\NIt's dangerous. Grigio, shut up!\NI'm trying to sleep! Uh, sorry! Jesus, R, are you crazy? The people here,\Nthey're not like me. If they see you,\Nyou'll get killed. Do you understand that? Yes.

You're safe here\Ntonight, R. After that I don't know\Nwhat we're gonna do. How did you die? I don't remember. How old are you?

I don't...\NAmazing. Nora, he didn't come here\Nfor an interview. Stop. Why did you come here, R? To show everyone... Show them what? That we can change. R, no one here is\Never gonna buy that. Not that we could\Nget you even close\Nenough to tell them. As soon as they saw you, they would blow\Nyour head to bits. Wait a minute.\NDid you say "we"? Lots of us changing. Dreaming. That's kind of\Na big deal. We have to move fast. What do you mean? Boneys chasing me.\NThey're chasing us. Okay, we have\Nto go to my dad. No, that is\Na very bad idea. No, Nora, he was\Na reasonable guy once. Oh, no,\NI think you're confused. It was your mom that\Nwas the reasonable one. It was your dad\Nthat grounded you\Nfor a year for stealing\NPeach Schnapps. Are you serious?\NIt's your dad that likes to shoot\NCorpses in the head. Well, what other choice\Ndo we have, Nora? Still, we'd have to\Nget him through the city. Someone would\Ndefinitely see you. There isn't much time. We could fix him up. What? I have some makeup\Nthat I was saving\Nfor a special occasion that obviously\Nisn't gonna happen. Yeah. Yeah, we could. We could put on\Na little bit of\Nfoundation, maybe a little blush.\NProbably a lot of blush. No way. Yeah, way. Would you change\Nthe song, please? What? It's funny. No, it's not. Fine. There we go. Oh, yeah. Hold up... You look hot! What? Nothing. It's just, you look nice. I don't know\Nhow my dad's gonna be. He gets kind of crazy.\NThis might not work. Hey. No matter what,\Nwe stay together. We're changing everything. I know. Stay together. Promise. I promise. Come on. Hey, it's game time.\NAll right, let's do this. Excuse me. Where are you\Nguys headed? To see my dad, Kevin. Miss Grigio,\NI can't let you guys in. We're on high alert\Naround here. Why? What's going on?\NIt's classified. All right, well,\Nwe have our own\Nclassified business, so come on. Hey. Hey. <i>Say something human.</i>\N<i>Say something human.</i> How are you? <i>Nailed it.</i> Over here. He's fine. Okay, you guys wait here. What are you doing here? What is going on?\NWhat is all this? I'm not sure,\Nbut it's not good. We've been\Ngetting reports there are sizable packs\Nof skeletons and Corpses coming toward us. We don't know why,\Nbut if they're here\Nto attack, there's nothing\Nwe can do about it. Too many of them,\Ntoo few of us. So I want you to get home,\Nlock down the house. I have the gun there,\Nthe Ruger SR... This? Yeah, okay.\NI need to talk to you. Julie, not now.\NDad, it's important. This is gonna sound\Nreally crazy, but I think the dead\Nare coming back to life. That does sound crazy. They're changing, Dad.\NThey're... I don't know.\NThey're somehow\Ncuring themselves. You think they're curing\Nthemselves? How is that? I saw it.\NIt is really happening. No. You know what is\Nhappening, Julie? What's happening\Nis every day there are more of them\Nand less of us. They are not\Ncuring themselves. We're their food source. They are not becoming vegan.\NOkay? They don't eat broccoli. They eat brains,\Nyour mother's and\Nyour boyfriend's included. Okay? So I want you\Nto wake up! I'll explain.\NOkay? What do you mean,\N"you'll explain"?\NExplain what? I got this. Get yourself home. Barricade yourself\Nin the shelter. There is enough stuff there\Nthat you can open up... Uh... Hi. Who are you? I didn't ask you.\NI asked him.\NWho are you? You're a Corpse? He saved my life.\NHe took care of me. I triggered\Nsomething in him and that must have sparked\Nsomething in all of them... No... Now it's triggered\Nsomething in me. Dad! No! Dad! We want to help. Please, they don't\Nwant to attack us.\NThey want to help. We're...\NWe're getting better. No. Things don't get better.\NThings get worse. People get bit,\Nthen they get infected, then I shoot them\Nin the head. No, Dad...\NThat's what happened to your mother, and that's\Nwhat's gonna happen to him. I'm really sorry,\NMr. Grigio. Go.

I know we lost everybody. I know you lost Mom.\NBut you and me,\Nwe are still here. We can fix all this.\NWe can start over. They need our help. Please, Dad!\NLook at him. He's different.\NHe's... Bleeding. He's bleeding, Dad. Corpses don't bleed! Oh, God. You're alive. He's alive! You're alive. Does it hurt? Yeah. Yeah? Sir? This is Colonel Grigio.\NThe situation has changed. Let's get you two\Nthe hell out of here. Are you still bleeding? Yes. Good. Sorry. <i>On the one hand,</i>\N<i>getting shot</i>\N<i>in the chest hurt.</i> <i>Like, a lot.</i> <i>But on the other,</i>\N<i>it felt good to bleed,</i>\N<i>to feel pain.</i> <i>To feel love.</i> <i>I wish I could say</i>\N<i>we cured the Boneys</i>\N<i>with love,</i> <i>but really we just</i>\N<i>straight up killed them .</i> <i>It sounds</i>\N<i>kind of messed up,</i> <i>but no one felt</i>\N<i>too bad about it.</i> <i>They were too far gone</i>\N<i>to change.</i> <i>It was actually</i>\N<i>a really good</i>\N<i>bonding experience</i> <i>for us and the humans.</i> <i>Once we joined forces,</i>\N<i>they didn't stand a chance.</i> <i>The ones we didn't kill</i>\N<i>just wasted away.</i> <i>And the rest of us?</i> <i>Well, we kind of learned</i>\N<i>how to live again.</i> <i>For a while,</i>\N<i>it seemed like</i> <i>a lot of us forgot</i>\N<i>what that meant.</i> <i>The humans</i>\N<i>began to accept us,</i> <i>connect with us,</i>\N<i>teach us.</i> <i>This was the key</i>\N<i>to the cure.</i> <i>It was scary at first, bt</i> <i>every great thing startst</i>\N<i>a little scary, doesn't ?</i> <i>This is how it happened.</i> <i>This is how the world was</i> <i>exhumed.</i> You need some help? Yeah. I have, uh,\Nzombie fingers. Thank you. Here. Oh, it's okay.\NI don't mind the rain. I insist. I'm... Mar-marcus. Emily. You're...\NYou're very pretty. Thank you, Marcus. Now you're supposed\Nto say I'm pretty, too. R? Yeah? Do you remember\Nyour name yet? No. Well, you know,\Nyou could just\Ngive yourself one. Just pick one.\NWhatever you want. I like "R." Really? You don't want to know\Nwhat it was? You don't want\Nyour old life back? No. I want this one. Just "R," huh? Just "R."
