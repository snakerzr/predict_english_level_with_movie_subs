Rachel, let me see. - Can I see?\N- Finders keepers. And I found it. In my garden. Finders keepers. Bruce? Bruce? Mom! Mr. Alfred! Did you have dream? Nightmare. Worse than this place? They are going to fight you. - Again?\N- Until they kill you. Can they kill me before breakfast? You are in hell, little man. And I am the devil. You're not the devil. You're practice. Solitary. - Why?\N- For protection. - I don't need protection.\N- Protection for them. Get in. Are you so\Ndesperate to fight criminals... ...that you lock yourself in\Nto take them on one at a time? Actually, there were seven of them. I counted six, Mr. Wayne. How do you know my name? The world is too small for someone\Nlike Bruce Wayne to disappear... ...no matter how deep\Nhe chooses to sink. Who are you? My name is merely Ducard,\Nbut I speak for Ra's al Ghul... ...a man greatly feared\Nby the criminal underworld. A man who can offer you a path. What makes you think I need a path? Someone like you\Nis only here by choice. You have been exploring\Nthe criminal fraternity... ...but whatever\Nyour original intentions... ...you have become truly lost. And what path can Ra's al Ghul offer? The path of a man\Nwho shares his hatred of evil... ...and wishes to serve true justice. The path of the League of Shadows. - You're vigilantes.\N- No, no, no. A vigilante is just a man lost in\Nthe scramble for his own gratification. He can be destroyed or locked up. But if you make yourself more\Nthan just a man... ...if you devote yourself to an ideal... ...and if they can't stop you... ...then you become\Nsomething else entirely. Which is? Legend, Mr. Wayne. Tomorrow, you will be released. If you are bored of brawling with thieves\Nand want to achieve something... ...there is a rare blue flower\Nthat grows on the eastern slopes. Pick one of these flowers. If you can carry it\Nto the top of the mountain... ...you may find what you were\Nlooking for in the first place. And what was I looking for? Only you can know that. You turn back. You go back. Ra's al Ghul? Wait. What are you seeking? I seek... ...the means to fight injustice. To turn fear... ...against those\Nwho prey on the fearful. To manipulate the fears in others... ...you must first master your own. Are you ready to begin? I can.... I can barely stand. Death does not wait\Nfor you to be ready! Death is not considerate or fair! And make no mistake,\Nhere you face death. Tiger. Jujitsu. Panther. You're skilled. But this is not a dance. And you are afraid. But not of me. Tell us, Mr. Wayne... ...what do you fear? Bruce? It's okay. It's okay. You'll be okay. Will we be needing\Nan ambulance, Master Wayne? No, l'll set the bone\Nand take him for an x-ray later. Very good, sir. - l'm very sorry, sir. I've told --\N- Don't worry. lt's fine. Took quite a fall,\Ndidn't we, Master Bruce? And why do we fall? So we can learn to pick ourselves up. Just a little fall.\NIt's just a small fracture. The bats again? You know why they attacked you,\Ndon't you? - They were afraid of you.\N- Afraid of me? All creatures feel fear. Even the scary ones? Especially the scary ones. I got something to show you. - You think your mother will like them?\N- Yeah. - I think it's time to get up.\N- Maybe. No going back to bed. Did you build this train, Dad? Gotham's been good to our family,\Nbut the city's been suffering. People less fortunate than us\Nhave been enduring very hard times. So we built a new, cheap, public\Ntransportation system to unite the city. And at the center... ...Wayne Tower. - ls that where you work?\N- No, I work at the hospital. I leave the running of our company\Nto much better men. - Better?\N- Well... ...more interested men. Can we go? Please. Okay. Let's go. - What's wrong, Bruce?\N- No, no. It was me. I just needed some fresh air. A little bit of opera goes a long way.\NRight, Bruce? Come on. Let's go. Wallets, jewelry. Come on, fast. That's fine.\NFast. Take it easy. Here you go. It's fine. It's fine. Now just take it and go. - I said, jewelry.\N- Hey -- Thomas! Bruce. It's okay. Don't be afraid. Is this your father's? It's okay. Come here. There you go. It's okay. Gordon. Hey. Good news. We got him, son. You're in excellent hands. We'll be watching the empire. When you grow up,\Nit'll be waiting for you. I thought I might prepare a little supper. - Very well.\N- Alfred? - Yes, Master Bruce?\N- lt was my fault, Alfred. - I made them leave the theater.\N- No. - lf I hadn't gotten scared....\N- lt was nothing that you did. It was him, and him alone. Do you understand? I miss them, Alfred.\NI miss them so much. So do l, Master Bruce. So do l. And do you still feel\Nresponsible for your parents' death? My anger outweighs my guilt. Come. You have learned to bury\Nyour guilt with anger. I will teach you to confront it\Nand to face the truth. You know how to fight six men.\NWe can teach you how to engage 600. You know how to disappear. We can teach you\Nto become truly invisible. Invisible? The ninja understands that invisibility\Nis a matter of patience and agility. Always mind your surroundings. Ninjitsu employs explosive powders. - As weapons?\N- Or distractions. Theatricality and deception\Nare powerful agents. You must become more than just a man\Nin the mind of your opponent. - Who is he?\N- He was a farmer. Then he tried to take his neighbor's land\Nand became a murderer. - Now he is a prisoner.\N- What'll happen to him? Justice. Crime cannot be tolerated. Criminals thrive on the indulgence\Nof society's understanding. Your parents' death was not your fault. It was your father's. Anger does not change the fact\Nthat your father failed to act. - The man had a gun.\N- Would that stop you? I've had training. The training is nothing! Will is everything! The will to act. Yield. You haven't beaten me. You have sacrificed sure footing\Nfor a killing stroke. Rub your chest. Your arms will take care of themselves. You are stronger than your father. You didn't know my father. But I know the rage that drives you. That impossible anger\Nstrangling the grief... ...until the memory\Nof your loved one is just... ...poison in your veins. And one day, you catch yourself wishing\Nthe person you loved had never existed... ...so you'd be spared your pain. I wasn't always here in the mountains. Once, I had a wife. My great love. She was taken from me. Like you, I was forced to learn\Nthere are those without decency... ...who must be fought\Nwithout hesitation, without pity. Your anger gives you great power. But if you let it, it will destroy you... ...as it almost did me. - What stopped it?\N- Vengeance. That's no help to me. Why, Bruce? Why could you not\Navenge your parents? Will you be heading back to Princeton\Nafter the hearing, sir... ...or can I persuade you to stay on\Nfor a day or two? I'm not heading back at all. - You don't like it there?\N- I like it fine. They just don't feel the same way. - l've prepared the master bedroom.\N- No. My room will be fine. With all due respect, sir,\NWayne Manor is your house. No, Alfred, it's my father's house. - Your father is dead.\N- This place is a mausoleum. If I have my way, l'll pull\Nthe damn thing down brick by brick. This house, Master Wayne, has sheltered\Nsix generations of your family. Why do you give a damn, Alfred?\NIt's not your family. I give a damn because a good man\Nonce made me responsible... ...for what was most precious to him... ...in the whole world. Miss Dawes has offered\Nto drive you to the hearing. She probably hopes\Nto talk you out of going. Should I just bury the past\Nout there with my parents, Alfred? I wouldn't presume to tell you\Nwhat to do with your past, sir. Just know that there are those of us who\Ncare about what you do with your future. Haven't given up on me yet? Never. Alfred still keeps the condensed milk\Non the top shelf. Hasn't he noticed\Nyou're tall enough to reach now? Old habits die hard, I guess. - Never used to stop us anyway.\N- No, it didn't. How's your mom? She misses this place. So do l. Yeah. But it's nothing without the people\Nwho made it what it was. - Now there's only Alfred.\N- And you. - l'm not staying, Rachel.\N- You're just back for the hearing. Bruce, I don't suppose there's any way\Nto convince you not to come. Someone at this proceeding... ...should stand for my parents. We all loved your parents, Bruce. - What Chill did is unforgivable.\N- Then why is your boss letting him go? In prison, he shared a cell\Nwith Carmine Falcone. He learned things, and he will testify\Nin exchange for early parole. Rachel, this man killed my parents. I cannot let that pass. And I need you\Nto understand that, please. Okay. The depression hit working\Npeople, like Mr. Chill, hardest of all. His crime was appalling, yes,\Nbut it was motivated not by greed... ...but by desperation. Given the 14 years served, as well as\Nhis extraordinary level of cooperation... ...with one of this office's\Nmost important investigations... ...we strongly endorse his petition\Nfor early release. Mr. Chill? Your Honor... ...not a day goes by that I don't wish\NI could take back what I did. Sure, I was desperate,\Nlike a lot of people back then... ...but that don't change what I did. I gather there is a member\Nof the Wayne family here today. Has he got anything to say? - He's coming out the side!\N- He's coming out the side, guys! Bruce Wayne! Joe! Hey, Joe! Falcone says hi. Come on, Bruce. We don't need to see this. I do. The DA couldn't understand\Nwhy Judge Faden insisted... ...on making the hearing public. Falcone paid him off\Nto get Chill out in the open. Maybe I should thank them. - You don't mean that.\N- What if I do, Rachel? My parents deserved justice. You're not talking about justice.\NYou're talking about revenge. - Sometimes, they're the same.\N- No, they're never the same. Justice is about harmony. Revenge is\Nabout you making yourself feel better. - lt's why we have an impartial system.\N- Your system is broken. You care about justice?\NLook beyond your own pain, Bruce. This city is rotting. They talk about the depression\Nas if it's history. lt's not. Things are worse than ever here. Falcone floods our streets\Nwith crime and drugs... ...preying on the desperate,\Ncreating new Joe Chills every day. Falcone may not have killed\Nyour parents, Bruce... ...but he's destroying everything\Nthat they stood for. You wanna thank him for that?\NHere you go. We all know where to find him.\NAs long as he keeps the bad people rich... ...and the good people scared,\Nno one'll touch him. Good people like your parents, who'll\Nstand against injustice, they're gone. What chance does Gotham have\Nwhen the good people do nothing? - l'm not one of your good people, Rachel.\N- What do you mean? All these years, I wanted to kill him. Now I can't. Your father would be ashamed of you. You're taller than you look\Nin the tabloids, Mr. Wayne. No gun? l'm insulted. - You could've just sent a thank-you note.\N- I didn't come here to thank you. I came to show you that\Nnot everyone in Gotham's afraid of you. Only those who know me, kid. Look around you.\NYou'll see two councilmen... ...a union official,\Ncouple off-duty cops... ...and a judge. I wouldn't have a second's hesitation of\Nblowing your head off in front of them. Now, that's power you can't buy. That's the power of fear. I'm not afraid of you. Because you think you got\Nnothing to lose. But you haven't thought it through. You haven't thought about\Nyour lady friend in the DA's office. You haven't thought about\Nyour old butler. Bang! People from your world... ...have so much to lose. Now, you think because your mommy\Nand your daddy got shot... ...you know about the ugly side of life,\Nbut you don't. You've never tasted desperate. You're.... You're Bruce Wayne,\Nthe prince of Gotham. You'd have to go 1000 miles to meet\Nsomeone who didn't know your name. So don't come here with your anger,\Ntrying to prove something to yourself. This is a world you'll never understand. And you always fear... ...what you don't understand. All right. Yeah, you got spirit, kid.\NI'll give you that. More than your old man anyway. In the joint, Chill told me about\Nthe night he killed your parents. He said your father begged for mercy. Begged. Like a dog. Should've tipped better. - For what?\N- Your jacket. Okay. Hey, hey, hey. Let me have it.\NIt's a nice coat. Be careful who sees you with that. - They're gonna come looking for me.\N- Who? Everyone. It's.... It's a nice coat. When you lived among\Nthe criminals, did you start to pity them? The first time I stole\Nso that I wouldn't starve, yes. I lost many assumptions about\Nthe simple nature of right and wrong. And when I traveled... ...I learned the fear before a crime... ...and the thrill of success. But I never became one of them. Fool. What do I care\Nwhat your name is? You're a criminal. I'm not a criminal Tell that to the guy who owned these. You've traveled the world\Nto understand the criminal mind... ...and conquer your fears. But a criminal is not complicated. And what you really fear\Nis inside yourself. You fear your own power. You fear your anger... ...the drive to do great\Nor terrible things. Now you must journey inwards. You are ready. Breathe. Breathe in your fears. Face them. To conquer fear,\Nyou must become fear. You must bask in the fear\Nof other men. And men fear most\Nwhat they cannot see. You have to become a terrible thought. A wraith. You have to become an idea! Feel terror cloud your senses. Feel its power to distort. To control. And know that this power\Ncan be yours. Embrace your worst fear. Become one with the darkness. Focus. Concentrate. Master your senses. You cannot leave any sign. I haven't. Impressive. We have purged your fear. You are ready to lead these men. You are ready to become a member\Nof the League of Shadows. But first, you must demonstrate\Nyour commitment to justice. No. I'm no executioner. Your compassion is\Na weakness your enemies will not share. That's why it's so important. It separates us from them. You want to fight criminals.\NThis man is a murderer. - This man should be tried.\N- By whom? Corrupt bureaucrats? Criminals mock society's laws. You know this better than most. You cannot lead these men... ...unless you are prepared to do\Nwhat is necessary to defeat evil. And where would I be leading\Nthese men? Gotham. As Gotham's favored son... ...you will be ideally placed\Nto strike at the heart of criminality. - How?\N- Gotham's time has come. Like Constantinople or Rome before it... ...the city has become a breeding ground\Nfor suffering and injustice. It is beyond saving\Nand must be allowed to die. This is the most important function\Nof the League of Shadows. It is one we've performed for centuries. Gotham... ...must be destroyed. You can't believe in this. Ra's al Ghul rescued us from\Nthe darkest corners of our own hearts. What he asks in return is the courage\Nto do what is necessary. I will go back to Gotham\Nand I will fight men like this... ...but I will not become an executioner. Bruce, please. For your own sake,\Nthere is no turning back. - What are you doing?\N- What's necessary, my friend. I will tell him you saved his life. Master Wayne,\Nyou've been gone a long time. - Yes, I have.\N- You look very fashionable. Apart from the mud. Are you coming back to Gotham\Nfor long, sir? As long as it takes. I want to show the people... ...their city doesn't belong\Nto the criminals and the corrupt. In the depression, your father nearly\Nbankrupted Wayne Enterprises... ...combating poverty. He believed his example could inspire\Nthe wealthy of Gotham to save their city. Did it? In a way. Their murder shocked the wealthy\Nand the powerful into action. People need dramatic examples\Nto shake them out of apathy. I can't do that as Bruce Wayne. As a man... ...l'm flesh and blood,\NI can be ignored, destroyed. But as a symbol.... As a symbol, I can be incorruptible. - I can be everlasting.\N- What symbol? Something elemental... ...something terrifying. I assume that as you take on\Nthe underworld... ...this symbol is a persona to protect\Nthose you care about from reprisals? You're thinking about Rachel? Actually, sir, I was thinking of myself. Have you told anyone l'm coming back? I couldn't figure the legal ramifications\Nof bringing you back from the dead. - Dead?\N- You've been gone seven years. You had me declared dead? Actually, it was Mr. Earle.\NHe's taking the company public. He wanted to liquidate\Nyour majority shareholding. Those shares are worth\Nquite a bit of money. Well, it's a good thing\NI left everything to you, then. Quite so, sir. And you can borrow the Rolls, if you like.\NJust bring it back with a full tank. In my opinion, Mr. Zsaz is as much\Na danger to himself as to others... ...and prison is probably not the best\Nenvironment for his rehabilitation. - Dr. Crane.\N- Miss Dawes. You think a man who butchers people\Nfor the mob doesn't belong in jail? I would hardly have testified to that\Notherwise, would l? This is the third of Falcone's thugs\Nyou've had declared insane... ...and moved into your asylum. The work offered by organized crime\Nmust have an attraction to the insane. Or the corrupt. Mr. Finch. You should check\Nwith Miss Dawes here... ...just what implications your office\Nhas authorized her to make. lf any. - What are you doing?\N- What are you doing, Carl? Looking out for you. Falcone has half the city\Nbought and paid for. - Drop it.\N- How can you say that? Because as much as I care about\Ngetting Falcone, I care more about you. That's sweet. We've been through all that. Blessed bat again, sir. They nest somewhere in the grounds. No more favors.\NSomeone is sniffing around. Hey, I scratch your back,\Nyou scratch mine, doc. I'm bringing in the shipments. We are paying you for that. Maybe money isn't as interesting\Nto me as favors. I am more than aware that you are\Nnot intimidated by me, Mr. Falcone. But you know who l'm working for,\Nand when he gets here -- He -- He's coming to Gotham? Yes, he is. And when he gets here,\Nhe's not going to wanna hear... ...that you've endangered our operation\Njust to get your thugs out of jail time. - Who's bothering you?\N- There's a girl at the DA's office. - We'll buy her off.\N- Not this one. Idealist, huh? Well, there's an answer to that too. - I don't want to know.\N- Yes, you do. No, we are showing\Nvery healthy growth in these sectors. I don't think Thomas Wayne would have\Nviewed heavy-arms manufacture... ...as a suitable cornerstone\Nfor our business. Well, that's 20 years ago, Fredericks. I think after 20 years\Nwe can allow ourselves... ...to stop thinking about what\NThomas Wayne would have done. Good morning, Mr. Earle's office. Yes, he's confirmed for\Nthe dinner tomorrow evening. Good morning.\NI'm here to see Mr. Earle. Name? Bruce Wayne. Thomas would probably not\Nhave taken the company public. But that is what we,\Nas responsible managers, are going to do. Jessica? Jessica? Where are you? - Eye on the ball, and....\N- Why is no one answering the phone? It's Wayne Enterprises, Mr. Earle.\NI'm sure they'll call back. Bruce? You're supposed to be dead. I'm sorry to disappoint. - I need you to take a look at this.\N- Have you seen him yet? - Who?\N- Wayne. It's been all over the news.\NHe's back. I'm sure you realize\NI can't stop the big machine. Too many wheels turning. - We're going public.\N- I understand. And l'll be handsomely rewarded\Nfor my shares. I'm not looking to interfere. - I am looking for a job.\N- Oh? I just want to get to know the company\Nthat my family built. Any ideas where you would start? Applied Sciences caught my eye. Fox's department. I'll let him know you're coming. You look like him. Your dad. You're the only one left\Nof the Wayne family. This is where you belong.\NWelcome home. Environmental procedures,\Ndefense projects, consumer products. All prototypes. None in production. - On any level whatsoever.\N- None? What did they tell you this place was? They didn't tell me anything. Earle told me exactly what it was\Nwhen he sent me down here. Dead end. Place to keep me from causing\Nthe board any more trouble. Come on. - You were on the board?\N- When your father ran things. - You knew my father?\N- Oh, yeah. Helped him build his train. Here we are. Kevlar utility harness. Gas-powered, magnetic grapple gun. The 350-pound test monofilament. Wonderful project, your dad's train. Routed it right into Wayne Tower,\Nalong with the water and power utilities. Kind of made Wayne Tower\Nthe unofficial center of Gotham City. Of course, Earle let it go to rot.\NHere we are. Nomex survival suit\Nfor advanced infantry. Kevlar biweave, reinforced joints. - Tear- resistant?\N- This sucker will stop a knife. - Bulletproof?\N- Anything but a straight shot. - Why didn't they put it into production?\N- Bean counters didn't think... ...a soldier's life was worth 300 grand. So, what's your interest in it,\NMr. Wayne? I want to borrow it. For spelunking. Spelunking? Yeah, you know, cave diving? You expecting to run into\Nmuch gunfire in these caves? Look, l'd rather Mr. Earle\Ndidn't know about me borrowing -- Mr. Wayne... ...the way I see it... ...all this stuff is yours anyway. Okay. Give it a try. Charming. At least you'll have company. This must be the lowest foundation\Nof the southeast wing. Your great-great-grandfather was\Ninvolved in the Underground Railroad... ...secretly transporting freed slaves\Nto the North... ...and I suspect these caverns\Ncame in handy. Alfred! Come up here! I can see everything all right\Nfrom down here, sir, thank you. We order the main part\Nof this cowl from Singapore. Via a dummy corporation. Indeed. And then, quite separately... ...we place an order\Nto a Chinese company for these. - Put it together ourselves.\N- Precisely. They'll have to be large orders,\Nto avoid suspicion. - How large?\N- Say 10,000. - Well, at least we'll have spares.\N- Yes. Don't suppose you want a taste. I just keep offering,\Nthinking maybe someday you'll get wise. There's nothing wise\Nin what you do, Flass. Well, Jimbo, you don't take the taste,\Nmakes us guys nervous. I'm no rat. In a town this bent,\Nwho's there to rat to anyway? Don't turn around. You're a good cop.\NOne of the few. What do you want? Carmine Falcone brings\Nin shipments of drugs every week. Nobody takes him down. Why? He's paid up with the right people. What will it take to bring him down? Leverage on Judge Faden... ...and a DA brave enough\Nto prosecute. Rachel Dawes. Who are you? Watch for my sign. You're just one man? Now we're two. We? Freeze! What the hell was that? Just some nut. Well, what is it today?\NMore spelunking? No. Today it's BASE-jumping. BASE-jumping. - That like parachuting?\N- Kind of. Do you have any lightweight fabrics? You know, I think I have just the thing. It's called memory cloth.\NNotice anything? Regularly flexible... ...but put a current through it... ...molecules realign, it becomes rigid.\N- What kind of shapes can you make? Can be tailored to fit any structure\Nbased on a rigid skeleton. Too expensive for the Army? I don't think they tried to market it\Nto the billionaire, BASE-jumping crowd. - Look, Mr. Fox.\N- Yes, sir? If you're uncomfortable -- Mr. Wayne, if you don't want to tell me\Nexactly what you're doing... ...when I'm asked, I don't have to lie. But don't think of me as an idiot. Fair enough. What's that? The Tumbler? Oh, you wouldn't be interested in that. She was built as a bridging vehicle. During combat, two of these\Nwould jump over a river, towing cables. Over here on the throttle,\Nflip that open and throttle up. This will boost you into a rampless jump --\NNot now! Not -- Not now, sir. Afterburner disengaged. We never could get\Nthe damn bridge to work... ...but this baby works just fine. So, what do you think? Does it come in black? I need you at the docks Thursday. - Problems?\N- I don't want any trouble... ...with the last shipment.\N-Sure. Word on the street is you got a beef\Nwith somebody in the DA's office. - ls that right?\N- And that there's a fat prize... ...waiting for anybody willing\Nto do anything about it. So, what's your point, Mr. Flass? Have you seen the girl? It's a cute little assistant DA. Don't you think that's a little too much\Nheat to bring down, maybe? - Even for this town.\N- Never underestimate Gotham City. People get mugged coming home\Nfrom work every day of the week. Sometimes --\NSometimes things just go bad. It's a problem with the graphite, sir. The next 10,000\Nwill be up to specifications. - At least they gave us a discount.\N- Quite. In the meantime, sir, may I suggest\Nyou try to avoid landing on your head? Why bats, Master Wayne? Bats frighten me. It's time my enemies shared my dread. What is this? Continue. Looks fine out there. The bears go straight to the dealers. Yeah, and the rabbits go\Nto the man in the Narrows. - What's the difference?\N- lgnorance is bliss, my friend. Don't burden yourself\Nwith the secrets of scary people. Hey. Steiss. Steiss? What? What the...? I better check it. There's a problem out here.\NYou better bail. Where are you?! Here. Take a ride. Oh, shit. What the hell are you? I'm Batman. Nice coat. Thanks. Hold it. That's right, you better run. Falcone sent them to kill you. - Why?\N- You rattled his cage. - What's this?\N- Leverage. - For what?\N- To get things moving. Who are you? Someone like you. Someone who'll rattle the cages. Ma'am? Everything okay? - Falcone's men?\N- Does it matter? We'll never tie him to it anyway. I wouldn't be too sure of that. What the hell is that? Cut him down. Unacceptable. Now, I don't care if it's rival gangs,\NGuardian Angels... ...or the goddamn Salvation Army... ...get them off the street\Nand off the front page. They say it was just one guy.\NOr a creature. It was some asshole in a costume. - Yeah?\N- This guy did deliver us... ...one of the city's biggest crime lords. No one takes the law\Ninto their own hands in my city. Understand? - No way to bury it now.\N- There's still Judge Faden. - l've got Faden covered.\N- What about this bat they babble about? Even if these guys will swear\Nto being thrashed by a giant bat... ...we've got Falcone at the scene. Drugs, prints, cargo manifests.\NThis bat character gave us everything. Okay. Let's do it. - Bats are nocturnal.\N- Bats may be. But even for billionaire playboys,\N3:00 is pushing it. The price for leading a double life,\NI fear. Your theatrics made an impression. Theatricality and deception... ...are powerful weapons, Alfred.\NThis is a good start. If those are to be the first\Nof many injuries to come... ...it would be wise\Nto find a suitable excuse. Polo, for instance. I'm not learning polo, Alfred. Strange injuries,\Na nonexistent social life. These things beg the question... ...as to what exactly does Bruce Wayne\Ndo with his time and his money. What does someone like me do? Drive sports cars, date movie stars. Buy things that are not for sale. Who knows, Master Wayne,\Nyou start pretending to have fun... ...you might even have a little\Nby accident. Sir. - We have a situation.\N- All right. The Coast Guard picked up\None of our cargo ships last night... ...heavily damaged, all crew missing,\Nprobably dead. The ship was carrying\Na prototype weapon. It's a microwave emitter. It's designed for desert warfare, but it -- It looks like somebody... ...turned it on. It uses focused microwaves to\Nvaporize the enemy's water supply. The damage to the ship\Nwas catastrophic. The weapon itself is.... Missing? Yeah. Mr. Wayne. Nice car. You should see my other one. He's done something\Nthe police never have. You can't take the law\Ninto your own hands. Well, at least he's getting\Nsomething done. Bruce, help me out here.\N- Huh? Well, a guy who dresses up\Nlike a bat clearly has issues. But he's put Falcone behind bars. Now the cops want him.\NWhat does that tell you? They're jealous. Sir, the pool is for decoration... ...and your friends\Ndo not have swimwear. Well, they're European. I'm going to have to ask you to leave. - lt is not a question of money.\N- Well, you see... ...l'm buying this hotel... ...and setting some new rules\Nabout the pool area. I think the Batman deserves a medal. And a straitjacket to pin it on. Thank you. Bruce? Rachel? I'd heard you were back. What are you doing? Just swimming here.\NWow, it is good to see you. You were gone a long time. - I know. How are things?\N- The same. Job's getting worse. Can't change the world on your own. What choice do I have... ...when you're too busy swimming? Rachel, all of -- All this.... It's -- It's not me. lt's.... Inside, I am.... I am more. Come on, Bruce. Come on. Bruce, we have\Nsome more hotels for you to buy. Bruce... ...deep down you may still be\Nthat same great kid you used to be. But it's not who you are underneath... ...it's what you do that defines you. Dr. Crane, thanks for coming. Not at all. He cut his wrists? Probably looking for the insanity plea.\NBut if anything should happen.... Of course, better safe than sorry. Yeah, Dr. Crane, I can't take it anymore.\NIt's all too much. The walls are closing in.\NBlah, blah, blah. A couple of days of this food,\Nit'll be true. - What do you want?\N- I wanna know... ...how you're gonna convince me\Nto keep my mouth shut. About what?\NYou don't know anything. I know you don't want the cops to take\Na closer look at the drugs they seized. And I know about your experiments\Nwith the inmates of your nut house. See, I don't go into business with a guy\Nwithout finding out his dirty secrets. And those goons you used. I own the muscle in this town. Now, l've been bringing\Nyour stuff in for months... ...so whatever he's planning,\Nit's big, and I want in. Well, I already know what he'll say. That we should kill you. Even he can't get me in here.\NNot in my town. Would you like to see my mask? I use it in my experiments. Now, l'm probably not very frightening\Nto a guy like you. But these crazies, they can't stand it. So when did the nut\Ntake over the nut house? They scream and they cry... ...much as you're doing now. Well, he's not faking. Not that one. I'll talk to the judge\Nand see if I can get him moved... ...to the secure wing at Arkham.\NI can't treat him here. Storm's coming. The scum is getting jumpy\Nbecause you stood up to Falcone. It's a start. Your partner\Nwas at the docks with Falcone. Well, he moonlights\Nas a low-level enforcer. They were splitting the shipment in two.\NOnly half went to the dealers. Why? What about the other half? - Flass knows.\N- He won't talk. He'll talk to me. Commissioner Loeb set up\Na massive task force to catch you. - He thinks you're dangerous.\N- What do you think? I think you're trying to help. But l've been wrong before. Come on, I ain't got all night. Flass, I have kids to feed. What, they don't like falafel? Where were the other drugs going? I never knew. I don't know. - I swear to God.\N- Swear to me! I don't -- I don't know.\NI never knew. Never. They went to some guy for a couple days\Nbefore they went to the dealers. Why? There was something --\NSomething else in the drugs... ..something hidden.\N- What? I never went to the drop-off point.\NIt was in the Narrows. - Cops only go there in force.\N- Do I look like a cop? No --! This is the one l'm talking about. - What's your problem with it?\N- lt shouldn't exist. This ship left Singapore with\N246 containers, but arrived with 247. I'm guessing there's something\NI'm not supposed to find in there. Listen, counselor, we don't wanna\Nknow what's in Mr. Falcone's crate. Things are working a little\Ndifferently now. Open it up. What the hell is this? It's you, isn't it?\NEverybody's been talking about you. Get in here! The other kids won't believe me. Get rid of all traces. - Better torch the whole place.\N- All right. Having trouble? Take a seat. Have a drink. You look like a man\Nwho takes himself too seriously. Do you want my opinion?\NYou need to lighten up. Alfred, help me. Blood. Take. Take poison. Blood poison. Poisonous. Poisonous. Bruce... ...why do we fall? - How long was I out?\N- Two days. It's your birthday. Many happy returns. I've felt these effects before,\Nbut this was so much more potent. It was some kind of hallucinogen,\Nweaponized, in aerosol form. You have been hanging out\Nin the wrong clubs, Mr. Wayne. I called Mr. Fox when your condition\Nworsened after the first day. I analyzed your blood... ...isolating the receptor compounds\Nand the protein-based catalyst. Am I meant to understand any of that? Not at all. I just wanted you to know\Nhow hard it was. - Bottom line, I synthesized an antidote.\N- Could you make more? You planning on gassing yourself\Nagain, Mr. Wayne? Well, you know how it is.\NYou're out at night, looking for kicks... ...someone's passing around\Nthe weaponized hallucinogens.... I'll bring what I have.\NThe antidote should inoculate you for now. Alfred, always a pleasure. Lucius. - You sure you don't want to come in?\N- I have to get back. - I wanted to leave this.\N- Thank you. Rachel? Looks like someone's been\Nburning the candle at both ends. - Must've been quite an occasion.\N- lt is my birthday. I know. I'm sorry I can't come tonight.\NI was just dropping off your present. - You've got better plans?\N- My boss has been missing for days... ...which means I should\Nprobably start by looking... ...at the bottom of the river.\N- Rachel. Excuse me. Rachel Dawes. Who authorized that? Get Crane down\Nthere now. Don't take no for an answer. Call Dr. Lehmann, tell him we need our\Nown assessment to the judge by morning. - What's wrong?\N- lt's Falcone. Dr. Crane moved him to Arkham Asylum\Non suicide watch. You're going to Arkham now?\NIt's in the Narrows, Rachel. You enjoy your party, Bruce. - Some of us have work to do.\N- You be careful. Happy birthday. But, Master Wayne,\Nthe guests will be arriving. Keep them happy until I arrive. Tell them that joke you know. Having fun? Bill? Now, what's a big shot like you\Ndoing in a place like this? I need some information. The Wayne Enterprise 47-B, 1-ME. 1-ME. It's a microwave emitter. lt was designed\Nto vaporize an enemy's water supply. Rumor was they tested dispersing\Nwater-based chemicals into the air... ...but isn't that illegal? I want all the information\Non the development of this project... ...all data, files, backup disks,\Non my desk right away. Did you lose one? I'm merging your department\Nwith Archives. And I am firing you. Didn't you get the memo? Scarecrow. Scarecrow. Miss Dawes, this is most irregular. I have nothing to add\Nto the report I filed with the judge. - I have questions about your report.\N- Such as? Isn't it convenient for a 52-year-old man\Nwho has no history of mental illness... ...to have a psychotic breakdown\Njust when he's about to be indicted? As you can see for yourself, there is\Nnothing convenient about his symptoms. - Scarecrow.\N- What's "scarecrow"? Patients suffering delusional episodes\Noften focus their paranoia... ...on an external tormentor... ...usually one conforming\Nto Jungian archetypes. In this case, a scarecrow. - He's drugged?\N- Psychopharmacology is my primary field. I'm a strong advocate. Outside, he was a giant. In here, only the mind\Ncan grant you power. You enjoy the reversal. I respect the mind's power\Nover the body. It's why I do what I do. I do what I do to keep thugs like Falcone\Nbehind bars, not in therapy. I want my own psychiatric consultant\Nto have full access to Falcone... ...including blood work.\NFind out what exactly you put him on. - First thing tomorrow, then.\N- Tonight. I've already paged Dr. Lehmann\Nat County General. As you wish. This way, please. There's something\NI think you should see. This is where we make the medicine. Perhaps you should have some,\Nclear your head. Who knows you're here? Who knows? He's here. Who? The Batman. - What do we do?\N- What anyone does... ...when a prowler comes around. - Call the police.\N- You want the cops here? At this point, they can't stop us. But the Batman\Nhas a talent for disruption. Force him outside,\Nthe police will take him down. Go. - What about her?\N- She hasn't got long. I gave her a concentrated dose. The mind can only take so much.\NNow go. The things they say about him. Can he really fly? I heard he can disappear. Well, we'll find out. Won't we? Taste of your own medicine, doctor? What have you been doing here? Who are you working for? Ra's -- Ra's al Ghul. Ra's al Ghul is dead.\NWho are you working for? Crane. Dr. Crane isn't here right now. But if you'd like to make\Nan appointment.... Batman, put down your \Nweapons and surrender. You're surrounded. - What are you waiting for?\N- Backup. - Backup?\N- The Batman's in there. SWAT's on the way.\NBut if you wanna go in now... ...l'll be right behind you, sir. SWAT's on the way. - Hey.\N- Hey. What's happened to her? Crane poisoned her with a psychotropic\Nhallucinogen, a panic-inducing toxin. - Let me get her down to the medics.\N- They can't help her, but I can. Get her downstairs.\NMeet me in the alley. Crane's been smuggling his toxin\Nhidden in Falcone's drugs... ...and they're dumping it\Ninto the water supply. - What was he planning?\N- I don't know. Was he working for Falcone? He mentioned someone else,\Nsomeone worse. She needs the antidote\Nbefore the damage is permanent. - How long does she have?\N- Not long. What is that? - Backup.\N- What the --? Excuse me. - How is she?\N- She's fading. We gotta go. I'll get my car. I brought mine. Yours? I've gotta get me one of those. He is in a vehicle. Make and color? It's a black... ...tank. Stay calm. You've been poisoned. I'm on him. Breathe slowly. Hold on. - What are you doing?\N- Shortcut. Air One to ground, block that ramp. He's got no way off that roof. Turn off your engine.\NStep away from the car. - Trust me.\NWeapons system activated. Who is this guy? Where's he going? He's on the roof. - What street is he taking?\N- He's not on a street. He's flying on rooftops. At least tell me what it looks like. Never mind. Got him. Coming right up on his butt. - We're tracking suspect\Nvehicle heading west on l-17. - Air One to ground.\N- I lost him. We've lost visual. Exit 9 is blocked. We'll loop back to check\Nthe frontage road. Stealth mode activated. Stay with me. What --? There he is. Just hold on. Rachel! They get any of this into the mains? Yeah. Notify the water company.\NThere's gotta be a way to isolate it. No. They put it all in.\NThey must've been at this for weeks. - Gotham's entire water supply is laced.\N- Why haven't we felt the effects? Must be a compound that\Nhas to be absorbed through the lungs. How do you feel? Where are we? - Why did you bring me here?\N- lf I hadn't, your mind would be lost. - You were poisoned.\N- lt was -- - lt was Dr. Crane.\N- Rest. Gordon has Crane. Is Sergeant Gordon your friend? I don't have the luxury of friends. I'm gonna give you a sedative.\NYou'll wake up back at home. When you do, get these to Gordon,\Nand Gordon alone. Trust no one. - What are they?\N- The antidote. One for Gordon to inoculate himself,\Nthe other for mass production. Mass production? Crane was just a pawn.\NWe need to be ready. When you told me your grand plan\Nfor saving Gotham... ...all that stopped me\Nfrom calling the men in white coats... ...was when you said\Nit wasn't about thrill-seeking. - lt's not.\N- What would you call that? - Damn good television.\N- lt's a miracle no one was killed. I didn't have time to observe\Nthe rules of the road, Alfred. You're getting lost inside\Nthis monster of yours. I'm using this monster to help\Nother people, just like my father did. For Thomas Wayne, helping others... ...wasn't about proving anything\Nto anyone, including himself. It's Rachel, Alfred. She was dying. She's downstairs, sedated.\NI need you to take her home. Well, we both care for Rachel, but what\Nyou're doing has to be beyond that. It can't be personal,\Nor you're just a vigilante. - ls Fox still here?\N- Yes, sir. We need to send these people away. Those are Bruce Wayne's guests.\NYou have a name to maintain. I don't care about my name. It's not just your name, sir.\NIt's your father's name. And it's all that's left of him. Don't destroy it. - Mr. Earle.\N- Happy birthday, Bruce. Thank you. How did the stock offering go? Prices soared. Who was buying? All kinds of funds and brokerages. It's a bit technical. The key thing is... ...our company's future is secure. Great. A little the worse for wear, l'm afraid. What was the plan, Crane? How were you gonna get\Nyour toxin into the air? Scarecrow. Scarecrow. Who were you working for, Crane? Oh, it's too late. You can't stop it now. Here. - Happy birthday, Bruce.\N- Thank you. Thanks. And thank you for that item. You're welcome. - I know you'll put it to good use.\N- I already have. How long would it take\Nto manufacture on a large scale? Weeks. Why? Somebody's planning to disperse\Nthe toxin using the water supply. The water supply won't help you\Ndisperse an inhalant. What? Unless you have a microwave emitter\Npowerful enough... ...to vaporize all the water\Nin the mains. A microwave emitter like the one\NWayne Enterprises just misplaced. Misplaced? Earle just fired me for asking\Ntoo many questions about it. Go back to Wayne Enterprises now\Nand start making more of that antidote. The police are gonna need as much\Nas they can get their hands on. My security clearance\Nhas been revoked. That wouldn't stop a man like you,\Nwould it? I suppose not. - Bruce, there's somebody you must meet.\N- Not now, Mrs. Delane. Now, am I pronouncing this right... ...Mr. Ra's al Ghul? You're not Ra's al Ghul. I watched him die. But is Ra's al Ghul immortal? Are his methods supernatural? Or cheap parlor tricks to conceal\Nyour true identity, Ra's? Surely a man who spends his nights\Nscrambling over the rooftops of Gotham... ...wouldn't begrudge me dual identities. I saved your life. I warned you about compassion, Bruce. Your quarrel is with me. You let these people go. You are welcome to explain\Nthe situation to them. Everyone. Everybody? I.... I want to thank you all for coming here\Ntonight and drinking all of my booze. No, really. There's a thing about being a Wayne... ...that you're never short of\Na few freeloaders, like yourselves... ...to fill up your mansion with.\NSo here's to you people. Thank you. - That's enough, Bruce.\N- l'm not finished. To all of you.... All of you phonies,\Nall of you two-faced friends... ...you sycophantic suck-ups\Nwho smile through your teeth at me... ...please, leave me in peace. Please go. Stop smiling, it's not a joke.\NPlease leave. The party's over, get out. The apple has fallen very far\Nfrom the tree, Mr. Wayne. He's turning into a jerk. Amusing. But pointless.\NNone of these people have long to live. Your antics at the asylum\Nhave forced my hand. So Crane was working for you. His toxin is derived from the organic\Ncompound found in our blue flowers. He was able to weaponize it. He's not a member of\Nthe League of Shadows? Of course not. He thought our plan\Nwas to hold the city to ransom. But really, you are gonna release\NCrane's poison on the entire city. Then watch Gotham tear itself apart\Nthrough fear. You're gonna destroy millions of lives. Only a cynical man would call\Nwhat these people have "lives," Wayne. Crime. Despair. This is not how man\Nwas supposed to live. The League of Shadows has been\Na check against human corruption... ...for thousands of years. We sacked Rome.\NLoaded trade ships with plague rats. Burned London to the ground. Every time a civilization reaches\Nthe pinnacle of its decadence... ...we return to restore the balance. Gotham isn't beyond saving. Give me more time.\NThere are good people here. You're defending a city so corrupt... ...we have infiltrated\Nevery level of its infrastructure. Time to play. When I found you in that jail,\Nyou were lost. But I believed in you. I took away your fear,\Nand I showed you a path. You were my greatest student. It should be you standing by my side,\Nsaving the world. I'll be standing where I belong. Between you\Nand the people of Gotham. No one can save Gotham. When a forest grows too wild,\Na purging fire is inevitable and natural. Tomorrow the world will watch in horror\Nas its greatest city destroys itself. The movement back to harmony\Nwill be unstoppable this time. - You attacked Gotham before?\N- Of course. Over the ages our weapons\Nhave grown more sophisticated. With Gotham we tried a new one.\NEconomics. But we underestimated certain\Nof Gotham's citizens... ...such as your parents. Gunned down by one of the very people\Nthey were trying to help. Create enough hunger\Nand everyone becomes a criminal. Their deaths galvanized the city\Ninto saving itself... ...and Gotham has limped on\Never since. We are back to finish the job. And this time no misguided idealists\Nwill get in the way. Like your father, you lack the courage\Nto do all that is necessary. If someone stands in the way\Nof true justice... ...you simply walk up behind them\Nand stab them in the heart. - I am gonna stop you.\N- You never did learn... ...to mind your surroundings. Justice is balance. You burned my house\Nand left me for dead. Consider us even. No one comes out. Make sure. They're all gone? - How many from maximum security?\N- Every one of them. Serial killers, rapists. Raise the bridges.\NWe don't want any getting off the island. Yeah, l'll raise the bridges... ...when I get every available unit out here\Nto catch the homicidal maniacs... ...that are running loose out there.\N- Come on! I hope you're not a member\Nof the fire brigade. Master Wayne! Master Wayne! What is the point of all those push-ups\Nif you can't even lift a bloody log? What have I done, Alfred? Everything my family... ...my father, built.... The Wayne legacy is more\Nthan bricks and mortar, sir. I wanted to save Gotham. I failed. Why do we fall, sir? So that we can learn\Nto pick ourselves up. You still haven't given up on me? Never. Down! Harassment! I see harassment! Maybe you'd like to see\Nsome excessive force? Madman with a gun. With residents furious... ...at the unprecedented show of police\Nstrength to round up the inmates.... We're about to raise these bridges. Officer, I am a Gotham City\Ndistrict attorney. Let me pass. - Just shut up!\N- Hey, Flass, cool it! Hold these people back. Hey, Gordon.\NSomebody here to see you. - What are you doing here?\N- Our friend sent me with this. It counteracts Crane's toxin. Hopefully you won't need it. Not unless he's got some way\Nof getting that crap into the air. All right, last one across. People, they want this\Nbridge up in no more than three minutes! Better get you off the island before\Nthey raise the bridges. Patrolman! Go! I can't find my mom. Hey! What the hell are you doing? Gentlemen... ...time to spread the word. And the word is... ...panic. Jesus. The pressure, it's spiking. Right there. That water main\Nis right under the Narrows. It's okay. This is Commissioner Loeb. Come on, somebody talk to me. Come on! Loeb, Loeb. This is Gordon. What the hell is going on? We need reinforcements.\NTAC teams, SWAT, riot cops! Gordon! All the city's riot police\Nare on the island with you! Well, they're completely incapacitated! It's okay, it's okay.\NNo one's gonna hurt you. Of course they are! - Crane?\N- No. Scarecrow. Gordon... ...there's nobody left to send in. So l'm on my own? The Narrows is tearing itself to pieces. This is just the beginning.\NIf they hit the whole city... ...there's nothing to stop Gotham\Ntearing itself apart. - How are they gonna do that?\N- The train. The monorail follows the water mains to\Nthe central hub beneath Wayne Tower. If the machine gets to the station... ...it'll cause a chain reaction\Nthat'll vaporize the city's water supply. Covering Gotham in this poison. I'm gonna stop him from loading\Nthat train, but I may need your help. - What do you need?\N- Can you drive stick? There you are! There is nothing to fear... ...but fear itself! I am here to help you! Batman will save us. He'll come. - He'll come.\N- Don't peek. This is Gordon.\NPrepare to lower the bridge. I told you he'd come. Wait. You could die. At least tell me your name. It's not who I am underneath... ...but what I do that defines me. Bruce? Well, well. You took my advice\Nabout theatricality a bit literally. - lt ends here.\N- For you and the police, maybe. My fight, however,\Nlies with the rest of Gotham. Now, if you'll excuse me,\NI have a city to destroy. - I can't beat two of your pawns?\N- As you wish. GPS online. In 100 yards. Gentlemen. Who the hell authorized this? Distance to Wayne Tower, three miles. The pressure's moving along the mains,\Nblowing the pipes. If that pressure reaches us... ...the water supply right across\Nthe whole city is gonna blow! At the next intersection, turn right. You will never learn. Sorry. - Familiar. Don't you have anything new?\N- How about this?! You have arrived at Wayne Tower. Evacuate the building. We're on top of the main hub\Nand it's gonna blow. Weapons system activated. Nice ride. Armed. Don't be afraid, Bruce. Come on. Come on. You are just an ordinary man in a cape. That's why you couldn't fight injustice,\Nthat's why you can't stop this train. Who said anything about stopping it? Yes! You never learned\Nto mind your surroundings! Have you finally learned to do\Nwhat is necessary? I won't kill you... ...but I don't have to save you. - The meeting's already started.\N- What meeting? Fox, I seem to remember firing you. You did. I got another job. Yours. On whose authority? Batman may\Nhave made the front page... ...but Bruce Wayne\Ngot pushed to page eight. Bruce Wayne. What makes you think you can decide\Nwho's running Wayne Enterprises? - The fact that l'm the owner.\N- What are you talking about? The company went public a week ago. And I bought most of the shares. Through various charitable foundations\Nand trusts and so forth. Look, it's all a bit technical,\Nbut the important thing... ...is that my company's future\Nis secure. Right, Mr. Fox? Right you are, Mr. Wayne. Didn't you get the memo? - l'm sorry I didn't tell you, Rachel.\N- No. No, Bruce... ...l'm sorry. The day that Chill died, l.... I said terrible things. But true things. I was a coward with a gun... ...and justice is about more\Nthan revenge, so thank you. I never stopped thinking about you. About us. And when I heard you were back, l.... I started to hope. But then I found out about your mask. Batman's just a symbol, Rachel. No. This... ...is your mask. Your real face is the one\Nthat criminals now fear. The man I loved... ...the man who vanished... ...he never came back at all. But maybe he's still\Nout there somewhere. Maybe someday,\Nwhen Gotham no longer needs Batman... ...l'll see him again. - Proved me wrong, you know.\N- About what? Your father would be very proud of you. Just like me. What will you do? Rebuild it. Just the way it was, brick for brick. Just the way it was, sir? Yeah, why? I thought this might be\Na good opportunity for... ...improving the foundations. - ln the southeast corner?\N- Precisely, sir. - Nice.\N- I couldn't find any mob bosses. - Well, sergeant?\N- lt's "lieutenant" now. You really started something. Bent cops running scared. Hope on the streets. - But?\N- The Narrows is lost. And we still haven't picked up Crane or\Nhalf the inmates of Arkham that he freed. We will. We can bring Gotham back. - What about escalation?\N- Escalation? We start carrying semiautomatics,\Nthey buy automatics. We start wearing Kevlar,\Nthey buy armor-piercing rounds. - And?\N- And you're wearing a mask... ...and jumping off rooftops. Now, take this guy. Armed robbery, double homicide. Got a taste for the theatrical, like you. Leaves a calling card. I'll look into it. I never said thank you. And you'll never have to.
