Mod f-x-square, d-x. So please finish Percival\Nfor next time. I know many of you had this as\Nundergraduates, but it won't hurt to brush up. Thank you, Steven. I also put an advanced Fourier system\Non the main hallway chalkboard. I'm hoping that one of you might\Nprove it by the end of the semester. Now the person to do so will\Nnot only be in my good graces... but also go on\Nto fame and fortune... by having their accomplishment\Nrecorded and their name printed... in the auspicious M.I.T. Tech. Former winners include Nobel laureates,\NField's medal winners... renowned astrophysicists\Nand lowly M.I.T. professors. Well, that's all.\NIf you have any questions... I'm sure that Tom\Nhas the answers. Hi, Will. - Kirsten, how you doing?\N- I'm all right. How are you? - Good.\N- I didn't get on Cathy last night. - No?\N- No. - Why not?\N- I don't know. - Cathy!\N- What? Why didn't you give me none of that\Nnasty little hoochie-woochie... - you usually throw at me?\N- Oh, fuck you... and your Irish curse,\NChuckie. Like I'd waste my energy spreadin'\Nmy legs for that Tootsie Roll dick? - Go home and give it a tug yourself.\N- Tootsie Roll! T- Toots! She's missin' a tooth,\NWill. She's got skin problems.\NI don't- Plus, it's like 5-to-2 Morgan ends up\Nmarryin' her, you know what I mean? There's only so many times you can\Nbang your friend's future wife. It's wrong.\NWhere you goin'? - I'm gonna take off.\N- Fuck you, you're takin' off. It's, like, what, 10:00? No, I'm tired. Irish curse? She don't know.\NThere ain't no Irish curse. Out! Stop\Npressuring me back. Stop crowding the plate!\NWhich one will it be? You're gonna get charged,\Nyou know that? You think I'm afraid of you, you big\Nfuck? You're crowdin' the fuckin' plate. Hey, uh, Casey's bouncin' up a bar at\NHarvard next week. We should go up there. - What are we gonna do up there?\N- I don't know. We'll fuck up some smart kids.\NProbably fit right in. Ow! Fuckin' punk. - Oh, what's up? You still tough?\N- Come on! Come on. Come on.\NThat's it. - Professor Lambeau?\N- Yes? I'm in your applied theories class. We're\Nall up at the math and science building. Come here. It's Saturday. - Unless you wanna have a drink with me tonight.\N- Maybe. We just couldn't wait\Nuntil Monday to find out. - Find out what?\N- Who proved the theorem. This is correct.\NWho did this? - Jack?\N- It wasn't me. - Nemesh?\N- N-No way. - Come on, Joey, now!\N- Billy, McNamara's up. Come on, kid! - Joey, dig it out! Dig it out!\N- Son of a bitch! Bring it down, Mac! That's how to\Ndo it! Attaboy! Take two, Mac. Hey, Morgan, who's the girl with the\Nstriped pants? She's got a nice ass. Yeah, that's a real nice ass.\N- Who's the guy she's with? That fuckin' guinea. I hate that\Nlittle bitch. Will knows him. Yeah, I do.\NYeah, fuckin' Carmine Scarpaglia. - That guy used to beat the shit out of me in kindergarten.\N- That guy? Yeah.\NMm-hmm. Fuck this.\NLet's get some food. - Oh, what, Morgan, you're not gonna go talk to her?\N- Fuck her. - I could go for a Whopper.\N- Let's go to Kelly's. Morgan, I'm not goin' to Kelly's just\N'cause you like the take-out girl. - It's 15 minutes out of our way.\N- What the fuck are we gonna do? We can't spare 15 minutes? Double burger. Double burger. Double burger. Chuck, I had\Na double burger. Would you shut the fuck up!\NI know what you ordered. I was there. - So give me my fuckin' sandwich.\N- What do you mean, your sandwich? I bought it. Morgan, how much money\Nyou got on you? I said I'd get change\Nwhen I get the snow cone. I said that when we pulled up. Give me\Nmy sandwich and stop bein' a prick. All right, well, give me your fuckin'\N16 cents that you got on you now. We'll put your fuckin' sandwich on layaway.\NHere we go. Keep it right up here for ya. We'll put you on a program. Every day\Nyou come in here with your six cents. - At the end of the week, you get your sandwich.\N- Are you gonna be an asshole? What am I, fuckin' sandwich welfare? I think\Nyou should establish a good line of credit. Like how you bought\Nyour couch- payment plans. Remember how your mother brought in\Nten dollars every day for a year. She finally got her couch\NRent-A-Center style. - Can I have my food, please?\N- Here's your fuckin' double burger. - Whoa!\N- Hey, hold up, Chuck. - Slow it down.\N- Who do we got? - I don't know yet.\N- Hey, douche bag! Yeah, you, you skank face! - Shut the fuck up. - Get outta\Nhere. - What are you worried about? Why don't you lick\Nmy love stick? We seen the guy 15 minutes ago. We should've\Nfight him then. We're eatin' our snacks now. - Shut up, Morgan, you're goin'.\N- I'm not goin'. - So don't go. - I'm not goin'.\N- Fuckin' go, Morgan. Let me tell you somethin'. If you're not\Nout there in two fuckin' seconds, when I'm done with them,\Nyou're next. Carmine, it's me, Will. Remember,\Nwe went to kindergarten together. - Fuckin', let's go, man.\N- Step on his fuckin' head. Get his ass on the ground.\NStop that motherfucker. Motherfucker, die! - Carter!\N- Come on! Will! Will, come on! Will, come on.\NLet's go. Let's go. Easy, brother, easy. - Hey, fellas, thanks for comin' out.\N- Come here! Whoa! Whoa! Ah. Fuck. Is it just my imagination,\Nor has my class grown considerably? Well, by no stretch\Nof my imagination... do I believe you've all come here\Nto hear me lecture. Rather, to ascertain the identity\Nof the mystery math magician. So without further adieu, come forward,\Nsilent rogue, and receive thy prize. Well, I'm sorry to disappoint\Nmy spectators, but... it seems there will be\Nno unmasking here today. However, uh, my colleagues and I\Nhave conferred, and there is a problem\Non the board right now... that took us\Nmore than two years to prove. So let this be said:\NThe gauntlet has been thrown down, but the faculty have answered\Nand answered with vigor. Hey, when's the arraignment? Next week. Sorry. - What are you doing?\N- Sorry. That's people's work.\NYou can't graffiti here. - Don't you walk away from me!\N- Hey, fuck you! Oh, you're a clever one.\NWhat's your name? Oh, my God. Looks right. Will, how retarded do you gotta be\Nto get fired from that job? I mean, how hard is it\Nto push a motherfuckin' broom around? Mitch, you got fired\Nfrom pushin' a fuckin' broom. I got fired 'cause\Nmanagement was restructuring. Yeah, restructuring the amount\Nof retards they had workin' for 'em. Shut up. You get canned\Nmore than tuna, bitch. At least I got a motherfuckin' job\Nright now, don't I? - Why'd you get fired, Will? Come on.\N- Management was restructuring. - My uncle could probably get you on a demo team.\N- Can he do that? You kiddin' me! I asked you\Nyesterday if I could get a job. And I told you "no"\Nyesterday. - What's up, Casey? - What's\Nup, Case? - What's up, Big Case? Let's sit over here. All right. Let's go. Oh, this is- this is\Na Harvard bar, huh? I thought there'd be, like,\Nequations and shit on the wall. I will take a pitcher\Nof the finest lager in the house. Timeout. I'm gonna have to bust a little move\Non them Harvard hotties down there at the bar. - Work some magic.\N- Get some potion for us. - Oh, hello.\N- Oh, hello. - Hi. How are ya?\N- Fine. - So, do you ladies, uh-\N- Come here often? Do I come here?\NI come here a bit. I'm here, you know,\Nfrom time to time. - Do you go to school here?\N- Yep. - Yeah, that's it. I think I had a class with you.\N- Oh, yeah. What class? - History.\N- Maybe. Yes, I think\Nthat's what it was. You don't necessarily- may not\Nremember me. You know, I like it here. - It doesn't mean 'cause I go here, I'm a genius. I am very smart.\N- Hey. - Hey, how's it goin'? How are ya?\N- Good. How ya doin'? What class\Ndid you say that was? - History.\N- Yeah. Just history? It must have been\Na survey course then. - Yeah, it was. It was surveys.\N- Right. You should check it out. It's a good\Ncourse. It'd be a good class. - How'd you like that course?\N- You know, frankly, - I found that class, you know, rather elementary.\N- Elementary. - You know, I don't doubt that it was.\N- Yeah. I, uh,\NI remember that class. It was, um-\NIt was just between recess and lunch. Clark, why don't you\Ngo away? - Why don't you relax?\N- Why don't you go away? - I'm just havin' fun with my new friend.\N- Are we gonna have a problem? No, no, no, no.\NThere's no problem here. I was just hoping you might give me\Nsome insight into the evolution... of the market economy\Nin the southern colonies. My contention is that prior to the\NRevolutionary War, the economic modalities- especially\Nin the southern colonies- could most aptly\Nbe characterized as... - agrarian precapitalist.\N- Let me tell you somethin'. Of course that's your contention.\NYou're a first-year grad student. You just got finished readin' some\NMarxian historian- Pete Garrison, probably- You're gonna be convinced of that till\Nnext month when you get to James Lemon. Then you're gonna be talkin' about how the\Neconomies of Virginia and Pennsylvania... were entrepreneurial\Nand capitalist way back in 1740. That's gonna last until next year. You're\Ngonna be in here regurgitatin' Gordon Wood, talkin' about, you know,\Nthe prerevolutionary utopia... and the capital-forming effects\Nof military mobilization. Well,\Nas a matter of fact, I won't, because Wood drastically\Nunderestimates the impact of- Wood drastically underestimates\Nthe impact of social distinctions... predicated upon wealth,\Nespecially inherited wealth. You got that from Vickers'\NWork in Essex County. Page 98, right? I read that too. Were you gonna\Nplagiarize the whole thing for us? Do you have any thoughts\Nof your own on this matter? Or is that your thing? You come into\Na bar. You read some obscure passage. Then pretend-\Npawn it off as your own. As your own idea just to impress\Nsome girls? Embarrass my friend? See, the sad thing about a guy like\Nyou is, in 50 years, you're gonna start doin'\Nsome thinkin' on your own. You're gonna come up with the fact that\Nthere are two certainties in life. One: Don't do that. And two: You dropped 150 grand\Non a fuckin' education... you could've got for $1.50\Nin late charges at the public library. Yeah, but\NI will have a degree, and you'll be servin' my kids fries at a\Ndrive through on our way to a skiing trip. Maybe, but at least\NI won't be unoriginal. If you have a problem with that, we could\Nstep outside. We could figure it out. No, man, there's no problem.\NIt's cool. - It's cool?\N- Yeah. - Cool.\N- Damn right, it's cool. How do you like me now? My boy's wicked smart. I just spent three minutes in this\Nfuckin' place and run into a barney, huh? There it is. - Nice to meet you.\N- They were fine, man. I was gonna close the deal, but then\NChuck- Billy insulted one of 'em- The heavyset girl said I had a receding\Nhairline, and I was a few pounds overweight. And I was, like,\N"Go fuck yourself. " I swallowed a bug. Hi. - You're an idiot.\N- What? You're an idiot. I've been sitting\Nover there for 45 minutes... waiting for you\Nto come and talk to me. But I'm tired now,\Nand I have to go home. I couldn't sit there anymore\Nwaiting for you. - I'm Will.\N- Skylar. - Skylar.\N- Oh, and by the way, that guy over there-\NMichael Bolton clone- He wasn't sitting with us,\Nso to speak. - I know. I kinda got that impression.\N- Good. Okay. Well, I've got to go. Gotta get up early and waste some more\Nmoney on my overpriced education. - No, I didn't mean you.\N- That's all right. There's my number. Maybe we can\Ngo out for coffee sometime. All right, yeah. Maybe we can just get\Ntogether and eat a bunch of caramels. - What do you mean?\N- When you think about it, - it's as arbitrary as drinkin' coffee.\N- Oh. Yeah. Okay. Uh, right, then. Oh, come on. You're kidding. Yo! - Fuck you, bitch!\N- Fuck you. - There goes them fuckin' barneys right now with his skiin' trip.\N- Hold on. We should've beat\Nthat old bitch's ass. Do you like apples? - Yeah.\N- Yeah? Well, I got her number!\NHow do you like them apples? Come. Excuse me? Is this\Nthe Buildings and Grounds office? Yeah. What can I do\Nfor you? I just need the name\Nof a student who works here. - No students work for me.\N- Could you please check? I have this guy\Nwho works in my building. - He's about this high.\N- Which one is your building? - Two.\N- Two. Building two. - Look, if anything was stolen, I should know about it.\N- No, it's nothing like that. I just need his name. - I can't give you his name unless you have a complaint.\N- This is Professor Lambeau. And this is\NProfessor Hayes. Tom, please. This is important.\NPlease. Will didn't show\Nfor work today. Got this job through\Nhis P.O. You can call him. - P.O.?\N- Yeah. Parole officer. Thank you. Asshole. There is a lengthy legal precedent,\NYour Honor, going back to 1789, whereby a defendant can claim self-defense\Nagainst an agent of the government... if that act is deemed a defense against\Ntyranny, a defense of liberty. Your Honor, Henry Ward Beecher, - in Proverbs from the Plymouth\NPulpit, 1887, said, quote- - 1887? - Excuse me.\N- This is the 20th century. - He's gonna make a mockery.\N- I am afforded the right to speak in my own defense, sir, by the Constitution\Nof the United States. - Don't tell me about the Constitution.\N- This guarantees my liberty. "Liberty," in case you've forgotten,\Nis a soul's right to breathe. When it cannot take a long breath,\Nlaws are girded too tight. - Without liberty, man is a syncope.\N- Man is a what? - Ibid., Your Honor.\N- Son, my turn. I've been sitting here for ten minutes\Nnow lookin' over this rap sheet of yours. I just can't believe it.\NJune '93, assault. September '93, assault. Grand theft auto,\NFebruary of '94. Where, apparently, you defended yourself\Nand had the case thrown out by citing... "free property rights\Nof horse and carriage" from 1798. Joke. January '95,\Nimpersonating an officer. Mayhem, theft, resisting.\NAll overturned. I'm also aware that you've been\Nthrough several foster homes. The state removed you from three\Nbecause of serious physical abuse. You know, another judge might care,\Nbut you hit a cop. You're going in. Motion to dismiss is denied.\N$50,000 bail. Thank you. Rise. - Hello?\N- Uh, Skylar? - Yep.\N- Hey, uh, it's Will. - Who?\N- It's Will. You know, the really funny, good-looking\Nguy you met at the bar the other night. I don't recall meeting anyone who matches\Nthat description. I think I'd remember. Oh, all right, you got me. It's the\Nugly, obnoxious, toothless loser... who got hammered and wouldn't\Nleave you alone all night. Oh, Will! I remember. How are you?\NI was wondering if you'd call me. - Yeah, look, I was wondering-\N- Yo, what's up, baby? - Hold on one second.\N- What you doing? Want some of my ass? - Herve, I remember you from juvi. How you doing?\N- What you doing? Oh, yeah,\Nsorry about that. I was wonderin' maybe we could\Nget together sometime this week. - Sit out at a cafe. Maybe have some caramels.\N- Oh, that sounds wonderful. - Yeah?\N- Yeah, sure. Where are you? Uh, well, actually,\Nthis is just a shot in the dark, but, uh, there's no chance\Nthat you're pre-law, is there? - Have a seat.\N- Thank you. Nice talking to ya. What the fuck\Ndo you want? I'm Gerald Lambeau. Professor you told\Nto fuck himself. Well, what the fuck\Ndo you want? I've spoken to the judge, and he's agreed\Nto release you under my supervision. - Really?\N- Yeah. - Under two conditions.\N- What are those? First condition is that\Nyou meet with me every week. - What for?\N- Go over the proof you're working on, get into\Nsome more advanced... combinatorial mathematics, finite math. Sounds like a real hoot. And the second condition\Nis that- that you see a therapist. I'm responsible to submit reports\Non those meetings. If you fail to meet with any of those\Nconditions, you will have to serve time. All right. I'll do the math, but I'm not\Ngonna meet with any fuckin' therapist. It's better than spending\Nthat time in jail, isn't it? I read your book, and "Mike"\Nwas havin' the same problems... that "Chad," the stockbroker,\Nwas havin'. Absolutely right. Right on the button.\NGood for you, Will. - Very nice.\N- Thank you. Will, the pressures-\Nand I'm not judging them. I'm not labeling them, but they are destroying\Nyour potential. No more shenanigans.\NNo more tomfoolery. No more ballyhoo. You're right.\NGod, I know. You're not gonna get off that easily.\NCome on, Will. A bit more. - Well, I mean, I do do things, you\Nknow? - What- What kind of things? I do things that, you know,\NI mean, I hide from people. - You hide, do you? - No, no. I\Nmean, I like- I go places. I interact. - Really? What sort of places?\N- Just certain clubs. More. That's nice. Yes.\NWhat sort of clubs? Like, uh, like Fantasy. Fantasy. That's nice.\NA bit more. It's something like when you get\Nin there, the music, like, owns you. It's like that house music. It's like- - You know, you start dancin'.\N- Boom, boom, boom. Yeah. It's just- Yes. Do you find it hard to hide\Nthe fact that you're gay? What are you talking about? What? Look, buddy, two seconds ago,\Nyou were ready to give me a jump. A jump? Are you- I'm terribly sorry\Nto disappoint you. Hey, I don't have a problem with it.\NI don't care if you putt from the rough. What are you- P- Putting from the rough?\NWhat on earth are you talking about? A difficult theorem\Ncould be like a symphony. It's very erotic. You go somewhere else.\NI can't handle this. - Wow.\N- Thank you, Henry. - Ah, Henry.\N- Hi, Gerry. You know something?\NI can't do this pro bono work anymore. - It's just not- It's not worth it.\N- What happened? Well, I'm going on national\Ntelevision next week. I mean, I haven't got time to tell you, much\Nless talk to that raving looney in there. An absolute lunatic,\Nhe is. Henry. Okay,\Nyou are in your bed, Will. Now, how old are you? Seven. What do you see? Something's in my room. What is it? It's like a- It's a figure.\NIt's hoverin' over me. You are in a safe place,\NWill. It's t-\NIt's touchin' me. Where is it touching you? It's touching me\Ndown there, and I'm nervous. You don't have to be\Nnervous, Will. We start dancin' and dancin'. It's just beautiful, 'cause we can make... a lot of love\Nbefore the sun goes down. - I'm sorry, Rich.\N- I have better things to do with my time. Come on! One dance! You really hypnotized me,\Nyou know? - For God's sake, Will.\N- What? Oh, come on. He left. You can't pin that on me. - I told you to cooperate with these people.\N- Look... - into my eyes.\N- Get out, Will. I don't need therapy. That's enough. Get out! - I called Mel Weintraub this\Nmorning to see- - Oh, what's the use? What do you want to do? - Well, there's someone.\N- Who is he? He used to be my, uh-\Nmy roommate in college. Trust. Very important\Nin a relationship. It's also very important\Nin a clinical situation. Why is trust\Nthe most important thing... in making a breakthrough\Nwith a client? Maureen, stop the oral fixation\Nfor a moment and join us. - Vinnie.\N- Um- Because, uh- Trust is, uh-\NTrust is life. Wow. That's very deep.\NThank you, Vinnie. Next time,\Nget the notes from your brother. If a patient doesn't feel safe enough trust\Nyou, then they won't be honest with you. Then there's really no point\Nfor them being in therapy. I mean, hey, if they don't trust you, you're\Nnever gonna get them to sleep with you. That should be the goal of any good\Ntherapist. Nail 'em while they're vulnerable. That's my motto. Oh, good, everyone's back.\NWelcome back, everybody. - Hello, Sean.\N- Hey, Gerry. Um, ladies and gentlemen,\Nwe are in the presence of greatness. Professor Gerald Lambeau, Field's medal\Nwinner for combinatorial mathematics. - Hello.\N- Anyone know what the Field's medal is? It's a really big deal.\NIt's like the Nobel prize for math. Except they only give it out once\Nevery four years. It's a great thing. It's an amazing honor.\NOkay, everybody, that's it for today. Thanks. We'll see you Monday.\NWe'll be talking about Freud. Why he did enough cocaine\Nto kill a small horse. Thank you. - How are you?\N- It's good to see you. Good to see you. - Sean, I think I got something interesting for ya.\N- Yeah? What, you have to have\Nblood and urine? What's up? Why didn't you come\Nto the reunion? You know, I'm-\NI've been busy. - You were missed.\N- Really? - So how long has it been since we've seen each other?\N- Before Nancy died. Yeah, I'm sorry. I was in Paris.\NIt was that damn conference. I got your card.\NIt was nice. - Come here.\N- Now that's a takedown. Hey, what happened?\NDid you get leniency or what? I got, uh, probation\Nand then counseling two days a week. Joke. You're a smoothie.\NCome on, Morgan! Just submit! Hey, Bill, just-just get off him.\NWe're gonna miss the game. - I've got a full schedule. I'm very busy.\N- Sean, Sean. This-This boy is incredible.\NI've never seen anything like him. What makes him\Nso incredible, Gerry? - You ever heard of Ramanujan?\N- Yeah, yeah. No. It's a man. He lived\Nover 100 years ago. He was Indian. - Dots, not feathers.\N- Not feathers. Yeah. He lived in this tiny hut\Nsomewhere in India. He had no formal education. - He had no access to any scientific work.\N- Coffee? - You, sir?\N- Just a little. But he came across\Nthis old math book, and from the simple text,\Nhe was able to extrapolate theories... that had baffled\Nmathematicians for years. Yes. Continued fractions.\NHe wrote, uh- - Well, he mailed it to Hardy at Cambridge.\N- Yeah, Cambridge. Yeah. - And Hardy immediately recognized\Nthe brilliance of his work... - Mm-hmm. and brought him over to England,\Nand then they worked together for years, creating some of the most\Nexciting math theory ever done. This-This Ramanujan- his-his genius\Nwas unparalleled, Sean. - Well, this boy's just like that.\N- Hmm. - But he's- he's a bit defensive.\N- Hmm. I need someone\Nwho can get through to him. - Like me?\N- Yeah, like you. - Why?\N- Well, because you have the same kind of background. - What background?\N- Well, you're from the same neighborhood. - He's from Southie?\N- Yeah. Boy genius from Southie. - How many shrinks you go to before me?\N- Five. - Let me guess. Barry? Henry? Not Rick?\N- Yeah. Yeah. - Sean, please, just meet\Nwith him once a week. - Mm-hmm. Please? It's a poker game with this kid.\NDon't let him know what you've got. He probably even read your book,\Nif he could find it. It's gonna be hard\Nfor him to find. - Hi, Will.\N- Hi. This is Sean Maguire.\NWill Hunting. How are ya? - Yeah. Let's get started.\N- Yeah, let's do it. I'm pumped.\NLet's let the healing begin. - Will you excuse us?\N- Yeah, please, Tom. You, too, Gerry. Yeah, of course. How are you? Where you from\Nin Southie? - I like what you've done with the place.\N- Oh, thanks. Do you buy all these books\Nretail, or do you send away for, like, a "shrink kit"\Nthat comes with all these volumes included? - Do you like books?\N- Yeah. - Did you read any of these books?\N- I don't know. - How about any of these books?\N- Probably not. What about the ones\Non the top shelf? You read those? - Yeah, I read those.\N- Good for you. What do you think about 'em? I'm not here for a fuckin' book report.\NThey're your books. Why don't you read 'em? I did. I had to. - Must've taken you a long time.\N- Yeah, it did. United States of America:\NA Complete History, Volume I. Jesus. If you wanna read\Na real history book, read Howard Zinn's\NA People's History in the United States. That book'll fuckin'\Nknock you on your ass. Better than Chomsky's\NManufacturing Consent? - Do you think that's a good book?\N- You fuckin' people baffle me. You spend all your money on these fuckin'\Nfancy books. You surround yourselves with 'em. - They're the wrong fuckin' books.\N- What are the right fuckin' books, Will? - Whatever blows your hair back.\N- Yeah. Haven't got much hair left. Hey, you know you'd be better\Nshoving that cigarette up your ass. - It'd probably be healthier for you.\N- Yeah, I know. - It really gets in the way of my yoga.\N- You work out, huh? - What, you lift?\N- Yeah. - Nautilus?\N- No, free weights. - Oh, really? Free weights, huh?\N- Yeah. Yeah, big time. - Yeah?\N- Just like that. - What do you bench?\N- 285. What do you bench? You paint that? - Yeah. Do you paint?\N- Uh-uh. - Do you sculpt?\N- No. Do you like art? - Do you like music?\N- This is a real piece of shit. Oh, tell me what\Nyou really think. Just the linear and impressionistic mix\Nmakes a very muddled composition. It's also a Winslow Homer rip-off, except\Nyou got whitey rowin' the boat there. Well, it's art, Monet.\NIt wasn't very good. - That's not really what concerns me though.\N- What concerns you? - Just the coloring.\N- You know what the real bitch of it is? It's paint-by-number. Is it color-by-number? Because\Nthe colors are fascinating to me. - Aren't they really?\N- You bet. I think you're about one step away\Nfrom cuttin' your fuckin' ear off. - Really?\N- Oh, yeah. Think I should move to the south of\NFrance, change my name to "Vincent"? - You ever heard the sayin', "any port in a storm"?\N- Yeah. - Yeah, maybe that means you.\N- In what way? - Maybe you're in the middle of a storm, a big fuckin' storm.\N- Yeah, maybe. The sky's fallin' on your head. The\Nwaves are crashin' over your little boat. The oars are about to snap. You just piss in your pants.\NYou're cryin' for the harbor. So maybe you do\Nwhat you gotta do to get out. You know, maybe you became\Na psychologist. Bingo. That's it. Let me do my job now.\NYou start with me. Come on. - Maybe you married the wrong woman.\N- Maybe you should watch your mouth! Watch it right there, chief,\Nall right? Ah. That's it, isn't it? You married\Nthe wrong woman. What happened?\NWhat, did she leave you? Was she, you know-\Nbanging some other guy? If you ever disrespect my wife again,\NI will end you. I will fuckin' end you. Got that, chief? Time's up. Yeah. At ease, gentlemen. You okay? Look, I'll understand if you don't\Nwanna meet with him again. Thursday, 4:00.\NMake sure the kid's here. Yeah. Thanks. Well, you look lovely\Nin those glasses. - Thank you very much.\N- They're just beautiful. - Yes, I always wanted dark blue eye shadow.\N- Wonderful. Growing up in England, you know,\NI went to a very nice school. You know, it was kind of progressive,\Norganic, do-it-yourself, private school. Then Harvard.\NHopefully med school. You know, I figured out,\Nby the end, my brain's gonna be worth\N$250,000. That sounded horrible,\Ndidn't it? Bring me another mai tai! Yeah, that's cool. I mean,\NI bet your parents were happy to pay. No, I was happy to pay.\NI inherited the money. Wow. Is Harvard gettin'\Nall that money? No, Stanford. I'm going there\Nin June when I graduate. All right, so you just wanted to use\Nthis sailor and then run away, huh? I was gonna, you know, experiment on you\Nfor anatomy class first, obviously. In that case, that's fine. - Hey, you wanna see my magic tricks, Skylar?\N- Of course. All right.\NPromise to- All right. - This one's for you, Rudolph.\N- Wait, wait. You need my wand. All right, give me a hit.\NThank you. All right. I'm gonna make\Nall these caramels disappear. You ready?\NReady. One, two, three. They're all gone. That was my- It works better\Nwhen I have my rabbit. Well- I don't really date,\Nyou know, that much. How very unfortunate...\NI think for me. You know what I mean?\NI know you've been thinking about it. - Oh, no, I haven't.\N- Yes, you have. - No, I really haven't.\N- Yes, you have. You were hoping to get a good night kiss. No, you know, I tell ya,\NI was hopin' to get a good night laid. But I'll settle for,\Nlike, a kiss, you know? - How very noble of you.\N- Thank you. - Mm.\N- No, I was- I was hopin' for a kiss. Well, why don't we just\Nget it out of the way now? - Right now?\N- Yeah. Come on. I think I got\Nsome of your pickle. You again, huh? Come with me. So what's this?\NA Taster's Choice moment between guys? This is really nice. You got a thing\Nfor swans? Is this, like, a fetish? Is it something, like, maybe\Nwe need to devote some time to? - Thought about what you said to me the other day. About my painting.\N- Oh. Stayed up half the night\Nthinking about it. Something occurred to me. I fell into a deep, peaceful sleep\Nand haven't thought about you since. - You know what occurred to me?\N- No. You're just a kid. You don't have the\Nfaintest idea what you're talking about. - Why, thank you.\N- It's all right. You've never been\Nout of Boston. Nope. So if I asked you about art,\Nyou'd probably give me the skinny... on every art book\Never written. Michelangelo?\NYou know a lot about him. Life's work, political aspirations.\NHim and the pope. Sexual orientation.\NThe whole works, right? I bet you can't tell me what it\Nsmells like in the Sistine Chapel. You never actually stood there\Nand looked up at that beautiful ceiling. Seeing that. If I ask you about women, you'll probably give me a syllabus\Nof your personal favorites. You may have even been laid\Na few times. But you can't tell me what it feels like\Nto wake up next to a woman... and feel truly happy. You're a tough kid. I ask you about war, you'd probably\Nthrow Shakespeare at me, right? "Once more into the breach,\Ndear friends. " But you've never been near one. You've never held your best friend's\Nhead in your lap... and watch him gasp his last\Nbreath lookin' to you for help. If I asked you about love,\Nyou'd probably quote me a sonnet, but you've never looked at a woman\Nand been totally vulnerable. Known someone that could\Nlevel you with her eyes. Feelin' like God put\Nan angel on Earth just for you, who could rescue you\Nfrom the depths of hell. And you wouldn't know\Nwhat it's like to be her angel, to have that love for her\Nbe there forever. Through anything.\NThrough cancer. And you wouldn't know about sleepin'\Nsittin' up in a hospital room... for two months,\Nholding her hand, because the doctors\Ncould see in your eyes... that the terms "visiting hours"\Ndon't apply to you. You don't know about real loss, 'cause that only occurs when you love\Nsomething more than you love yourself. I doubt you've ever dared\Nto love anybody that much. I look at you. I don't see\Nan intelligent, confident man. I see a cocky,\Nscared shitless kid. But you're a genius, Will.\NNo one denies that. No one could possibly understand\Nthe depths of you. But you presume to know everything about\Nme because you saw a painting of mine. You ripped\Nmy fuckin' life apart. You're an orphan, right? Do you think I'd know the first thing\Nabout how hard your life has been- how you feel, who you are- because I read Oliver Twist? Does that encapsulate you? Personally, I don't give a shit\Nabout all that, because- You know what? I can't\Nlearn anything from you... I can't read\Nin some fuckin' book. Unless you wanna talk\Nabout you, who you are. And I'm fascinated.\NI'm in. But you don't wanna do that,\Ndo you, sport? You're terrified\Nof what you might say. Your move, chief. Hello? Hello? Hello? Professor Valenti,\Nare you calling me again? Freak. - Oh, God.\N- Christ, who did you call? - No one. I forgot the number.\N- You fuckin' retarded? You went all the way out there in the\Nrain, and you didn't bring the number. No, it was your mother's 900 number.\NI just ran out of quarters. Why don't we get off on mothers?\NI just got off yours. - That's\Npretty funny, Morgan. That's a fuckin' nickel,\Nbitch. - Keep antagonizing me. Watch what happens.\N- All right, then, Morgan. - Watch what happens.\N- All right, then, Morgan. Keep fuckin' with me. No smoking. What do you mean, he didn't talk?\NYou were in there for an hour. He just sat there counting the seconds\Nuntil the session was over. - Pretty impressive, actually.\N- Why would he do that? To prove to me he doesn't have\Nto talk to me if he doesn't want to. What is this? Some kind of staring contest\Nbetween two kids from the old neighborhood? Yeah, it is,\Nand I can't talk first. We know your theory, Alexander, but the\Nboy's found a simple geometrical picture. - A tree structure won't work.\N- Look now. He's joining the two vertices. But I can do the sum. - It's how you group the terms, Alexander.\N- But, Gerry. If we do the whole thing\Nthis way, then- Hey, look, look. I wrote it down.\NIt's simpler this way. Sometimes\Npeople get lucky. You're a brilliant man. You know,\NI was on this plane once, and I'm sittin' there, and... the captain gets on,\Nhe does his whole, you know, "we'll be cruisin' at 35,000 feet,"\Nbut then he puts the mike down. - He forgets to turn it off.\N- Mm-hmm. So he turns to the copilot.\NHe's, like, "You know, all I could use right now is\Na fuckin' blow job and a cup of coffee. " So the stewardess fuckin' goes bombin'\Nup from the back of the plane... to tell him\Nthe microphone's still on. This guy in the back of the plane's like,\N"Hey, hon, don't forget the coffee. " You ever been on a plane? No, but it's a fuckin' joke. It works\Nbetter if I tell it in the first person. Yeah, it does. I have been laid,\Nyou know? Really? Good for you. - Big time, big time.\N- Big time, huh? I went on a date last week. - How'd it go?\N- It was good. - Goin' out again?\N- I don't know. - Why?\N- Haven't called her. - Christ, you're an amateur.\N- I know what I'm doin'. Yeah. Don't worry about me.\NI know what I'm doin'. Yeah, but this girl was, like,\Nyou know, beautiful. She's smart. She's fun. She's different\Nfrom most of the girls I've been with. - So call her up, Romeo.\N- Why, so I can realize she's not that smart. That she's fuckin' boring?\NYou know, I mean, you don't- This girl's, like, fuckin' perfect\Nright now. I don't wanna ruin that. Maybe you're perfect right now.\NMaybe you don't wanna ruin that. But I think that's\Na super philosophy, Will. That way, you can go through your entire life\Nwithout ever having to really know anybody. My wife used to fart\Nwhen she was nervous. She had all sorts\Nof wonderful idiosyncrasies. You know, she used to fart\Nin her sleep. Just thought I'd share that\Nwith you. One night it was so loud,\Nit woke the dog up. She woke up and gone, like,\N"Was that you?" I said, "Yeah. " I didn't have\Nthe heart to tell her. Oh, God. - She woke herself up?\N- Yes. Oh, Christ. But, Will, she's been dead\Ntwo years and that's the shit I remember. It's wonderful stuff, you know?\NLittle things like that. Yeah, but those are the things\NI miss the most. Those little idiosyncrasies\Nthat only I knew about. That's what made her\Nmy wife. Boy, and she had the goods on me too.\NShe knew all my little peccadillos. People call these things\N"imperfections," but they're not. That's the good stuff. And then we get to choose who\Nwe let into our weird little worlds. You're not perfect, sport. And let me save you\Nthe suspense. This girl you met,\Nshe isn't perfect either. But the question is whether or not\Nyou're perfect for each other. That's the whole deal.\NThat's what intimacy is all about. Now you can know\Neverything in the world, sport, but the only way you're findin' out\Nthat one is by givin' it a shot. You certainly won't learn\Nfrom an old fucker like me. Even if I did know,\NI wouldn't tell a pissant like you. Yeah, why not? You told me every other\Nfuckin' thing. Jesus Christ. Fuckin' talk more than any shrink\NI ever seen in my life. I teach the shit.\NI didn't say I knew how to do it. Yeah. You ever think\Nabout gettin' remarried? My wife's dead. - Hence the word "remarried. "\N- She's dead. Yeah, well, I think\Nthat's a super philosophy, Sean. I mean, that way, you can actually\Ngo through the rest of your life... without ever really knowing\Nanybody. Time's up. - Hold it open.\N- Okay. Thanks. "G" minor seventh.\NSaddest of all chords. - Hello.\N- Hey. - Where have you been? - I'm sorry. I've\Nbeen, like- I've been really busy, and- - But, um-\N- Mmm. Me too. Yeah. I-\NI thought you'd call. Yeah, um- - I mean, we had a really good time.\N- I had a really good time too. I mean, I just- I- I'm sorry, you know.\NI blew it. No. No, I mean,\Nyou know, it's all right. Yeah, um, so, I was\Nwonderin' if, uh, if, you know, you'd give me\Nanother crack at it. You know, let me\Ntake you out again. - I can't.\N- All right. Oh, no, I didn't- I didn't mean\NI can't, like, ever. I just can't right now. I've got to assign\Nthe proton spectrum for "ebogamine. " All that sounds really, really interesting.\NIt's actually fantastically boring. - All right, um-\N- Maybe some other time. - Like tomorrow?\N- Um, yeah, all right. - Okay.\N- Okay. - Bye.\N- Bye. What are you doing here? I couldn't wait\Ntill tomorrow. Where the fuck\Ndid you get this? I had to sleep\Nwith someone in your class. Oh, I hope it was someone with the\Nopen-toed sandals and the really bad breath. - Come on. Let's go have some fun.\N- No, I've got to learn this. Well, you're not going into\Nsurgery tomorrow, are you? - No.\N- Let's go. Oh, my God!\NMy dog is winning! Come on, Misty! Come on! Run!\NLook at that! Come on! Look, there he goes.\NMisty, run! Come on! - We won.\N- He totally won. So did you grow up\Naround here then? Not far.\NSouth Boston. Still glowing from my win. Look at you.\NYou're so happy. And what was\Nthat like then? It was normal, I guess.\NNothin' special. Do you got lots of\Nbrothers and sisters? - Do I have a lot of brothers and sisters?\N- That's what I said. - Well, Irish Catholic, what do you think?\N- Right. That's right. - How many?\N- You wouldn't believe me if I told you. - Why? Go on. What? Five?\N- No. Seven? Eight?\NHow many? - I have 12 big brothers.\N- You do not! No, I swear to God. I swear to God.\NI'm lucky 13 right here. Do you know\Nall their names? Do I- Yeah,\Nthey're my brothers. What are they called? Marky, Ricky, Danny, Terry, Mikey, Davey,\NTimmy, Tommy, Joey, Robby, Johnny and Brian. Say it again. Marky, Ricky, Danny, Terry, Mikey, Davey,\NTimmy, Tommy, Joey, Robby, Johnny and Brian. And Willy. - Willy?\N- Yeah. - Will.\N- Wow. - Do you still see all of them?\N- Yeah, well, they all live in Southie. - I'm livin' with three of 'em right now.\N- Oh, yeah? - Yeah.\N- I'd like to meet them. Yeah, we'll do that. Oh, you know,\NI read your book last night. Oh, so you're the one. Do you still, uh-\NDo you still counsel veterans? No, I don't. - Why not?\N- Well, I gave it up when my wife got sick. You ever wonder what your life would be\Nlike if you, uh, if you never met your wife? What? Wonder if I'd be\Nbetter off without her? - No, no, no, I'm not saying, like, better off.\N- No. - I didn't mean it like that.\N- It's all right. It's an important question. 'Cause you'll have bad times,\Nbut that'll always wake you up... to the good stuff\Nyou weren't paying attention to. And you don't regret\Nmeetin' your wife? Why? 'Cause the pain\NI feel now? Oh, I got regrets, Will, but I don't\Nregret a single day I spent with her. So when did you know, like,\Nthat she was the one for you? October 21, 1975. Jesus Christ.\NYou know the fuckin' day? Oh, yeah, 'cause it was game six of the\NWorld Series, biggest game in Red Sox history. - Yeah, sure.\N- My friends and I had slept out all night to get tickets. - You got tickets?\N- Yep. Day of the game I was sittin' in a bar, waitin' for the game to start\Nand in walks this girl. It was an amazing game though. You know,\Nbottom of the eighth, Carbo ties it up. It was 6-6.\NIt went to 12. Bottom of the 12th, in stepped\NCarlton Fisk, old Pudge. Steps up to the plate.\NYou know, he's got that weird stance. - Yeah, yeah. - And then-\NBoom! He clocks it, you know. High fly ball\Ndown the left field line! Thirty-five thousand people\Non their feet, yellin' at the ball. But that's nothin', 'cause Fisk,\Nhe's wavin' at the ball like a madman. - Yeah, I've seen that.\N- "Get over! Get over! - Right.\N- Get over!" Then it hits the foul pole.\NHe goes ape-shit, and 35,000 fans- They charge the field,\Nyou know. Yeah, and he's fuckin'\Nblowin' people outta the way. "Get outta the way!\NGet outta the way!" I can't fuckin' believe you had\Ntickets to that fuckin' game! - Did you rush the field?\N- No, I didn't rush the fuckin' field. I wasn't there. - What?\N- No, I was in a bar, havin' a drink with my future wife. You missed Pudge Fisk's home run to have a\Nfuckin' drink with some lady you never met? Yeah, but you should have\Nseen her. She was a stunner. - I don't care if-\N- Oh, no, no, she lit up the room. - I don't care if Helen of Troy walks into the room.\N- Oh, Helen of Troy! That's game six! Oh, my God,\Nand who were these friends of yours? - They let you get away with that?\N- They had to. - What did you say to 'em?\N- I just slid my ticket across the table. I said, "Sorry, guys.\NI gotta see about a girl. " - "I gotta go see about a girl"?\N- Yes! That's what you said?\NThey let you get away with that? Oh, yeah. They saw it\Nin my eyes that I meant it. - You're kiddin' me?\N- No, I'm not kidding you, Will. That's why I'm not talkin' right now about\Nsome girl I saw at a bar 20 years ago... and how I always regretted\Nnot goin' over and talkin' to her. I don't regret the 18 years\NI was married to Nancy. I don't regret the six years I had\Nto give up counseling when she got sick, and I don't regret the last years\Nwhen she got really sick. And I sure as hell don't\Nregret missin' a damn game. That's regret. Wow! Would have been nice\Nto catch that game though. I didn't know Pudge\Nwas gonna hit a home run. You know, I'm very, very\Nuseful on the court. I'm extremely tall. - You're not that tall.\N- I dunk. Will I ever play in the N.B.A.? "It is decidedly so. "\NHmph. Why do we always stay here? 'Cause it's nicer\Nthan my place. Yes, but I've never\Nseen your place. I know. When am I gonna meet\Nyour friends and your brothers? Well, they don't really\Ncome down here that much. I think I can make it\Nto South Boston. It's kind of a hike. Is it me you're hiding from them\Nor the other way around? - All right, we'll go.\N- When? I don't know.\NWe'll go sometime next week. What if I said I would not sleep with you\Nagain until you let me meet your friends? I'd say it's, like, 4:30 in the mornin'.\NThey're probably up. Oh, my God.\NMen are shameless. If you're not thinking with your wiener,\Nthen you're acting directly on its behalf. You bet. And on behalf of my wiener,\Ncan I get an advance payment? I don't know. Let's ask.\N"Outlook does not look good. " - What? - Fuck the- Hey, Chuck.\NNo. Nothing. Go back to sleep. "Outlook"? That's the same thing that\Ntold you you was gonna play in the N.B.A. Exactly, so look out. You'd better\Nstart buying some season tickets. Mmm! I plan to. I'm tall.\NI like wearing shorts. Hook, hook. Dunk, dunk. - You're not that tall.\N- Yes, I am. Maybe I'm all\Nabout three points. I'm all about home runs. Stop mixing your\Nsporting metaphors. A leprechaun's got his dick\Nin the monkey's ass. Morgan comes runnin' in, goin',\N"I don't mind it. I don't mind-" Well, I can't believe you brought Skylar here\Nwhen we're fuckin' all bombed and drinkin'. I know, Morgan. It's a real rarity\Nwe'd be all drinkin'. My uncle Marty drinks. He'll go\Non a bender for six, eight months. Did I ever tell ya what happened to him when\Nhe was drivin' up there and got pulled over? - I told you guys, right?\N- Marty, yeah. Let me tell ya what happened to my uncle\NMarty, because you oughta know this. He's always tellin' stories. Every time\Nwe come here he's got another story. But we all heard this one.\NGo ahead. Say it anyway. I will go ahead. Thanks a lot.\NGuess I have the floor now. My uncle Marty's\Ndrivin' home, right? Bombed out of his tree, right? Just\Nhammered out of his gourd. Just wrecked. This state trooper sees him, pulls him\Nover. So my uncle's fucked basically. Got him out of the car,\Ntryin' to make him walk the line. He gets out of the car, pukes, and the\Nstatie's pretty sure he's over the legal limit. So he's about to throw the cuffs\Non him and put him in jail. All of a sudden, 50 yards down the road,\Nthere's this huge fuckin' boom. - Statie gets real spooked.\NHe turns around- - He got shot? No. So- So- You\Nheard this story before. Yeah, Morgan, stop.\NStop. Some other guy's car had hit a tree.\NThere was an accident. Anyway- - How could he hear-\N- Shut the fuck up! - You're drivin' him nuts.\N- I'm gonna break your neck. Shut up! He told you the story\Nonce before. So he tells my uncle,\N"Stay here. Don't move. " Statie goes runnin' down the road\Nto deal with the other accident. After a few minutes of just\Nlyin' in his own piss and vomit, my uncle starts wonderin'\Nwhat he's doin' there. Gets up, gets in his car\Nand just drives home. The next mornin'\Nmy uncle's just passed out. He hears this knockin' at the door. So he goes downstairs,\Npulls the door open- "What?" It's the state trooper\Nthat pulled him over. Statie says,\N"Fuck you mean, 'What?' You know what. I pulled you over\Nlast night is what, and you took off. " He's like, "I never\Nseen you before in my life. I've been home all night with my kids.\NI don't know who the fuck you are. " He's like, "You know who I am.\NLet me get in your garage. " My uncle's like, "What?" He said, "You\Nheard me. Let me get in your garage. " He was like, "All right. Fine. " Takes\Nhim out to the garage, opens the door. And there's- The statie's police\Ncruiser is in my uncle's garage. He was so fuckin'- He was so fuckin' hammered\Nhe drove the wrong car home. The best part about it is,\Nthe fuckin' state trooper... was so embarrassed\Nhe didn't do anything. He'd been drivin' around all night in my\Nuncle's Chevelle, lookin' for the house. All right, Chuck, what the fuck\Nis the point of your story? He got away.\NThat's the point. - Well, question-\N- Come on. Stop. - I'm tryin' to clarify somethin'.\N- You're embarrassing him. - It doesn't make any sense.\N- It does make sense, if you listen to the story\Nand quit askin' questions. Well, let's see if you can get this one.\NI've got a little story for you. All right, there's an old couple\Nin bed, Mary and Paddie. They wake up on the morning\Nof their 50th anniversary. Mary looks over and\Ngazes adoringly at Paddie. She's like,\N"Oh, Jesus, Paddie. You're such a good-looking\Nfeller. I love ya. I want to give ya\Na little present. Anything your little heart desires,\NI'm goin' to give it to ya. What would ya like? Paddie's like, "Oh, gee, Mary.\NThat's a very sweet offer. Now, in 50 years, there's one thing\Nthat's been missing, and, uh, I would like you\Nto give me a blow job. I would like for it. "\NMary's like, "All right. " She takes her teeth out, puts 'em in\Nthe glass. She gives him a blow job. Afterwards, Paddie's like, "Yeah, geez,\Nnow that's what I've been missin'. That was the most beautiful,\Nearth-shattering thing ever! Beautiful, Mary!\NI love ya! Is there anything\Nthat I can do for you?" Mary looks up to him and she goes,\N"Give us a kiss. " - Oh!\N- Oh, my God! - That's filthy.\N- It's not that filthy. I've heard filthy. - Get off of me!\N- All right. See you guys later. All right.\NTake it easy, Bill. So, Skylar,\Nthanks for comin' by. Changed my opinion\Nof Harvard people. You don't want to rush to judgment on\Nthat one, 'cause they're not all like me. Oh. I'm sure.\NIt was nice to meet ya. - Oh.\N- Take it easy. Slowly back away. - Oh, come on. Brother.\N- I don't know what you're doin', dude. - You're givin' us a ride.\N- What the fuck do I look like to you? - Come on, Chuck.\N- You're walkin', bitch. Will's takin' the car. All right, thanks, sucker.\NI appreciate it. I don't know what you're\Ngettin' all serious about. - You're droppin' me off first.\N- It's really out of the way. Oh, okay. Just 'cause you don't have to\Nsleep in your one-room palace tonight... don't start\Nthinkin' you're bad. Hey, wait a minute. You said\Nwe were gonna see your place. - Not tonight.\N- Oh, no, not tonight. Not any other night. He knows once you see that shit-hole\Nhe's gettin' dropped like a bad habit. But I wanted to meet\Nyour brothers. We're gonna do that\Nanother time. All right. Need them keys. The stewardess hears this\Nand goes haulin' ass down the aisle. I yell,\N"Don't forget the coffee. " No shit!\NYou didn't say that. For Christ's sake, Marty,\Nit's a joke. - I know someone that actually happened to, Marty.\N- A joke. - Gerry.\N- Hi. - Have trouble findin' the place?\N- No, I took a cab. Timmy, this is Gerry.\NWe went to college together. How you doin'?\NNice to meet ya. - Pleased to meet you.\N- Can I get you a beer? Um, no, just a Perrier. That's French\Nfor club soda. - Club soda, yeah.\N- Couple of sandwiches too. - Sure.\N- Put it on my tab. You ever plannin'\Non payin' your tab? Yeah, chief, got the winning\Nlottery ticket right here. - What's the jackpot?\N- Twelve million. - I don't think that'll cover it.\N- It'll cover your sex change operation. - Nuts?\N- No, thank you. So, you wanted\Nto talk about Will. - Well, it seems to be going well.\N- I think so. Have you talked to him\Nat all about his future? No, we haven't gotten into that yet.\NWe're still bangin' away at the past. Maybe you should. My phone's been\Nringing off the hook with job offers. - What kind?\N- Cutting edge mathematics, think tanks. The kind of place where a mind\Nlike Will's is given free rein. That's great that there are offers, but\NI don't really think he's ready for that. I'm not sure\Nyou understand, Sean. - What don't I understand?\N- Here you go, guys. - Thanks, Tim.\N- Yeah, thank you. Just so you don't\Nget sticky fingers. Tim, can you help us? We're tryin'\Nto settle a bet. Uh-oh. - Ever heard of Jonas Salk?\N- Sure. Cured polio. - Ever heard of Albert Einstein?\N- Hey. How about Gerald Lambeau?\NEver heard of him? - No.\N- Thank you, Tim. - So who won the bet?\N- I did. This isn't about me, Sean. I'm nothing compared\Nto this young man. You ever hear of\NGerald Lambeau? In 1905 there were hundreds of professors\Nrenown for their study of the universe. But it was a 26-year-old\NSwiss patent clerk, doing physics in his spare time,\Nwho changed the world. Can you imagine if Einstein\Nwould have given that up... just to get drunk with his buddies\Nin Vienna every night. We all would have\Nlost something. Tim would never\Nhave heard of him. - Pretty dramatic, Gerry.\N- No, it isn't, Sean. This boy has that gift. He just doesn't got the direction,\Nbut we can give that to him. Hey, Gerry, in the 1960s, there was a young\Nman graduated from University of Michigan. Did some brilliant work\Nin mathematics. Specifically,\Nbounded harmonic functions. Then he went on to Berkeley. He was\Nassistant professor. Showed amazing potential. Then he moved to Montana, and\Nhe blew the competition away. - Yeah, so who was he?\N- Ted Kaczynski. Haven't heard of him. - Hey, Timmy!\N- Yo! - Who's Ted Kaczynski?\N- Unabomber. That's exactly\Nwhat I'm talking about. - We gotta give this kid direction.\N- Yeah- He can contribute to the world,\Nand we can help him do that. Direction's one thing.\NManipulation's another. - Sean-\N- We have to let him find- I'm not sitting at home every night\Ntwisting my mustache and hatching a plan... to ruin this boy's life! I was doing advanced mathematics\Nwhen I was 18, and it still took me over 20 years to do\Nsomething worthy of a Field's medal. Maybe he doesn't want\Nwhat you want. There's more to life\Nthan a fuckin' Field's medal. This is too important, Sean,\Nand it's above personal rivalry. Wait a minute.\NLet's talk about the boy. Why don't we give him time\Nto figure out what he wants? That's a wonderful theory, Sean.\NIt worked wonders for you, didn't it? Yeah, it did,\Nyou arrogant fuckin' prick! Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry\Nthat I came here today. I came here out of courtesy.\NI wanted to keep you in the loop. Nice to be in the loop. The boy's in a meeting right now\NI set up for him over at McNeil. Well, Will, I'm not exactly sure\Nwhat you mean. We've already\Noffered you a position. Nobody in this town works\Nwithout a retainer, guys. You think you can find somebody\Nwho does, you have my blessin'. But I think we all know that person is\Nnot gonna represent you as well as I can. Will, our offer\Nis $84,000 a year. Retainer!\NRetainer. You want us to give you\Ncash right now? Whoa-ho-ho. Easy-\NNow, I didn't say that. Allegedly,\Nyour situation, for you, would be concurrently\Nimproved if I had... $200 in my back pocket\Nright now. I don't think I can- Larry? - I've got $73.\N- Will you take a check? Let me tell you somethin'.\NYou're suspect. Yeah, you. I don't know\Nwhat your reputation is in this town, but after the shit\Nyou tried to pull today, you can bet\NI'll be lookin' into you. Now, any business\Nwe have heretofore, you can speak with\Nmy aforementioned attorney. Good day, gentlemen. And until that day comes,\Nkeep your ear to the grindstone. - How's it goin'?\N- Fine. Yeah. Good. - Want some help?\N- No! Come on. Give me one little peek,\Nand we'll go to the batting cages. No. It is actually important\Nthat I learn this. - It's really important... to me, okay?\N- All right. - Why don't we just hang out here all day?\N- Yes, why don't we? All right, Mr. Nosey Parker. Seeing as you're intent\Non breaking my balls, - let me ask you a question.\N- All right. Do you have\Na photographic memory? I don't know. I just kind of remember. I\Nmean, how do you remember your phone number? You just do. - Have you studied organic chemistry?\N- A little bit. - Oh, just for fun?\N- Yeah, for kicks. Yeah, it's so much fun\Nstudying organic chemistry. Are you mad? Have you completely\Nlost your mind? Nobody studies it for fun. It's not a\Nnecessity, especially for someone like you. - Someone like me?\N- Yeah. Someone who divides their time, fairly\Nevenly, between batting cages and bars. - I would hardly say it was a necessity.\N- Oh. You know, there are very\Nsmart people here at Harvard. Even they have to study,\Nbecause this is really hard. And yet... you do it\Nso easily. I don't understand. I don't understand\Nhow your mind works. - Did you play the piano?\N- I want to talk about this. No, I'm trying to explain it to you.\NDo you play the piano? - Yeah, a bit.\N- So when you look at a piano, you see Mozart. - I see "Chopsticks. "\N- All right, well, Beethoven, okay? He looked at a piano, and it just\Nmade sense to him. He could just play. - So what are you saying? You play the piano?\N- Not a lick. I look at a piano, I see a bunch of\Nkeys, three pedals and a box of wood. But Beethoven, Mozart-\NThey saw it. They could just play. I couldn't paint you a picture. I\Nprobably can't hit the ball out of Fenway. - And I can't play the piano. - But you\Ncan do my O- chem paper in under an hour. Right. Well, I mean, when it came to\Nstuff like that, I could always just play. That's the best\NI can explain it. - Come here. I have to tell you something.\N- Huh? - I have to tell you something.\N- Oh. Well- - It's not fair.\N- What's not fair? What? I've been here for four years, and I've only just found you. Well, you found me. - Are you awake?\N- No. Yes, you are. What? I want you to come\Nto California with me. - You sure about that?\N- Oh, yeah. Yeah, but how do you know? I don't know.\NI just know. Yeah, but how do you know? I know because I feel it. - Because that's a really serious thing you're saying.\N- I know. You could be in California\Nnext week... and you might find out\Nsomething about me you don't like. Maybe you wish\Nyou hadn't said that, but you know it's such a serious thing\Nyou can't take it back. Now I'm stuck in California with someone\Nthat doesn't really want to be with me, - just wish they had a take-back.\N- A what? What's a take-back? I don't want a take-back. I just want\Nyou to come to California with me. Well, I can't go to\NCalifornia with you, so- Why not? Well, one, because\NI got a job here. And, two,\Nbecause I live here. Look, um, if you don't love me,\Nyou should just tell me. I'm not sayin'\NI don't love you. Then why? Why won't you come?\NWhat are you so scared of? What am I so scared of? Well, what aren't\Nyou scared of? You live in this safe little world\Nwhere no one challenges you- Don't tell me about my world.\NDon't tell me about my world. You just want to have your little fling\Nwith the guy from the other side of town. Then you're gonna go off to Stanford.\NYou're gonna marry some rich prick... who your parents\Nwill approve of... and just sit around with\Nthe other trust fund babies... and talk about how you\Nwent slummin', too, once. Why are you saying this?\NWhat is your obsession with this money? My father died when I was 13,\Nand I inherited this money. You don't think every day I wake up,\Nand I wish I could give it back. That I would give it back in a second if\Nit meant I could have one more day with him. But I can't, and that's\Nmy life, and I deal with it. So don't put your shit on me\Nwhen you're the one that's afraid. I'm afraid? What am I afraid of?\NWhat the fuck am I afraid of? You're afraid of me. You're afraid\Nthat I won't love you back. You know what?\NI'm afraid too. But fuck it, I want to give it a shot.\NAt least I'm honest with you. - I'm not honest with you?\N- No, what about your 12 brothers? All right. No, you're not going.\NYou're not leaving. What do you want to know? That I don't\Nhave 12 brothers? That I'm a fuckin' orphan? - You don't want to hear that.\N- I didn't know that. You don't want to hear I got fuckin'\Ncigarettes put out on me when I was little. - I didn't know that.\N- That this isn't fuckin' surgery. The motherfucker stabbed me. You don't\Nwant to hear that shit, Skylar! - I do want to hear that.\N- Don't tell me you want that shit! - I want to help you.\N- Help me? What the fuck? What do I got, a fuckin' sign\Non my back that says, "Save me"? - No.\N- Do I look like I need that? - No, I just want to be with you-\N- Don't bullshit me! - I love you.\N- Don't bullshit me! Don't you fuckin' bullshit me! I love you. I want to hear you say\Nthat you don't love me. Because if you say that... then I won't call you... and I won't be in your life. I don't love you. Most people never get to see\Nhow brilliant they can be. They don't find teachers\Nthat believe in them. They get convinced\Nthey're stupid. I hope you appreciate\Nwhat he's doing, because I've seen how much\Nhe enjoys working with you, not against you. Hello, Will. Tom, can you get us\Nsome coffee? Sure. Now, let's see. Good. This is correct. I see you used Maclaurin here. Yeah, I don't know what\Nyou call it, but- This can't be right. This would be\Nvery embarrassing. - Did you ever consider-\N- I'm pretty sure it's right. Hey, look, can we do this\Nat Sean's office from now on? Because I got to knock off work to come\Nhere and the commute is killin' me. - Yeah, sure. Did you think of\Nthe possibility- - That's right. It's right.\NJust take it home with you. What happened\Nat the McNeil meeting? I couldn't go.\NI had a date. So I sent my\Nchief negotiator. On your own time, you can do\Nwhatever you like, Will. But when I set up a meeting\Nwith my associates, and you don't show up,\Nit reflects poorly on me. - Then don't set up any more meetings.\N- I won't. I'll cancel 'em. I'll give you a job myself. I just\Nwanted you to see what was out there. Maybe I don't want to spend the rest of\Nmy fuckin' life explainin' shit to people. I think you could show me\Nsome appreciation. A little appreciation?\NDo you know how easy this is for me? Do you have any fuckin' idea how easy\Nthis is? This is a fuckin' joke. I'm sorry you can't do this-\NI really am- Because I wouldn't have to fuckin' sit here\Nand watch you fumble around and fuck it up. Then you'd have more time to sit around\Nand get drunk instead, wouldn't you? You're right. This is probably\Na total waste of my time. You're right, Will. I can't do this proof,\Nbut you can. And when it comes to that, it's only about\Njust a handful of people in the world... who can tell the difference\Nbetween you and me. - But I'm one of them.\N- Sorry. Yeah, so am I. Most days I wish\NI never met you, because then I could\Nsleep at night. I didn't have to walk around with the knowledge\Nthat there was someone like you out there. I didn't have to watch you\Nthrow it all away. Bill, hold it. Did you hear that? Morgan! If you're watchin' pornos in my mom's room\Nagain, I'm gonna give you a fuckin' beatin'! What's up, fellas? Morgan, why don't you jerk off in your\Nown fuckin' house. That's fuckin' filthy. I don't have a V.C.R.\Nin my house. Come on. Not in my glove. I didn't use the glove. That's my\NLittle League glove. What do you want me\Nto do? I mean, what's wrong\Nwith you? You'll hump\Na baseball glove? I- I just used it\Nfor cleanup. Stop jerkin' off in my mother's room. - Is there another V.C.R. in the house?\N- It's just sad, bro. So why do you think I should work\Nfor the National Security Agency? Well, you'd be working\Non the cutting edge. You'd be exposed to the kind of\Ntechnology you wouldn't see anywhere else, because we've classified it. Superstring theory,\Nchaos math, advanced algorithms. Code breaking. That's one aspect\Nof what we do. Oh, come on.\NThat is what you do. You guys handle 80% of\Nthe intelligence workload. You're seven times\Nthe size of the C.I.A. We don't like to brag about that, Will,\Nbut you're exactly right. So the way I see it,\Nthe question isn't: "Why should you work\Nfor the N.S.A.?" The question is:\N"Why shouldn't you?" Why shouldn't\NI work for the N.S.A.? That's a tough one,\Nbut I'll take a shot. Say I'm workin' at the N.S.A.\Nand somebody puts a code on my desk. Something no one else\Ncan break. Maybe I take a shot at it\Nand maybe I break it. I'm real happy with myself\Nbecause I did my job well. But maybe that code was the location of some\Nrebel army in North Africa or Middle East. Once they have that location, they bomb\Nthe village where the rebels are hidin'. Fifteen hundred people that I never met,\Nnever had no problem with, get killed. Now the politicians are saying, "Send in\Nthe Marines to secure the area," 'cause they don't give a shit. It won't be their kid\Nover there gettin' shot, just like it wasn't them when their number got\Ncalled 'cause they were in the National Guard. It'll be some kid from Southie\Nover there takin' shrapnel in the ass. He comes back to find the plant\Nhe used to work at... got exported to the country\Nhe got back from, and the guy who put the shrapnel\Nin his ass got his old job... 'cause he'll work for 15 cents\Na day and no bathroom breaks. Meanwhile, he realizes the only reason\Nhe was over there in the first place... was so we could install a government\Nthat would sell us oil at a good price. Of course, the oil companies used a skirmish\Nover there to scare up domestic oil prices. A cute little ancillary benefit for them, but\Nit ain't helpin' my buddy at 2.50 a gallon. They're takin' their sweet time\Nbringin' the oil, of course. Maybe they even took the liberty\Nto hire an alcoholic skipper, who likes to drink martinis and fuckin'\Nplay slalom with the icebergs. It ain't too long till\Nhe hits one, spills the oil... and kills all the sea life\Nin the North Atlantic. So now my buddy's out of work,\Nhe can't afford to drive, so he's walkin' to\Nthe fuckin' job interviews... which sucks because the shrapnel in his\Nass is givin' him chronic hemorrhoids. Meanwhile, he's starvin', 'cause every\Ntime he tries to get a bite to eat, the only blue plate special\Nthey're servin'... is North Atlantic scrod\Nwith Quaker State. So what did I think?\NI'm holdin' out for somethin' better. I figure, fuck it. While I'm at it,\Nwhy not just shoot my buddy, take his job,\Ngive it to his sworn enemy, hike up gas prices, bomb\Na village, club a baby seal, hit the hash pipe\Nand join the National Guard? I can be\Nelected president. - You feel like you're alone?\N- What? Do you have a soul mate? Do I have a-\NDefine that. Somebody who challenges you. - Uh, Chuckie.\N- No, Chuckie's family. He'd lie down in fuckin' traffic for you. I'm talking about someone who opens\Nup things for you, touches your soul. - I got- I got-\N- Who? - I got plenty.\N- Well, name 'em. Shakespeare, Nietzsche, Frost,\NO'Connor, Kant, Pope, Locke- That's great.\NThey're all dead. - Not to me they're not.\N- You don't have a lot of dialogue with them. You can't give back\Nto them, Will. - Not without some serious smelling salts and a heater.\N- That's what I'm saying. You'll never have that kind\Nof relationship in a world... where you're always afraid\Nto take the first step, because all you see is every\Nnegative thing ten miles down the road. - You gonna take the professor's side on this?\N- Don't give me a line of shit. - No.\N- I didn't want the job. It's not about the job. I don't care\Nif you work for the government. But you can do anything you want.\NYou are bound by nothing. What are you passionate about?\NWhat do you want? There are guys who work\Ntheir entire life layin' brick... so their kids have a chance\Nat the opportunities you have here. - I didn't ask for this.\N- No. You were born with it, so don't cop out\Nbehind: "I didn't ask for this. " - What do you mean, cop out? What's wrong with layin' brick?\N- Nothing. There's nothin' wrong.\NThat's somebody's home I'm buildin'. Right. My dad\Nlaid brick, okay? Busted his ass so\NI could have an education. Exactly. That's\Nan honorable profession. What's wrong with\Nfixin' somebody's car? Someone will get to work the next day\Nbecause of me. That's honor in that. Yeah, there is, Will.\NThere is honor in that. There's honor in takin'\Nthat 40-minute train ride... so those college kids could come in in\Nthe morning and their floors are clean. - And their wastebaskets are empty. That's real work.\N- That's right. And that's honorable. I'm sure\Nthat's why you took that job. I mean, for the honor of it. I just have a little question here.\NYou could be a janitor anywhere. Why did you work at the most prestigious\Ntechnical college in the whole fuckin' world? Why did you sneak around at night\Nand finish other people's formulas... that only one or two people in the world\Ncould do and then lie about it? 'Cause I don't see\Na lot of honor in that, Will. So what do you\Nreally wanna do? I wanna be a shepherd. Really? I wanna move up to Nashua, get a nice little\Nspread, get some sheep and tend to them. - Maybe you should go do that.\N- What? You know, if you're gonna jerk off, why don't\Nyou just do it at home with a moist towel? - You're chuckin' me?\N- Yeah, get the fuck outta here. - No, no, no, time's not up yet.\N- Yeah, it is. - I'm not leavin'. No.\N- You're not gonna answer, you're wastin' my time. I thought we were friends. - Playtime's over, okay?\N- Why are you kickin' me out? You're lecturin' me on life?\NLook at you, you fuckin' burnout. - What winds your clock?\N- Workin' with you. Where's your soul mate? You wanna\Ntalk about soul mates? Where is she? - Dead.\N- That's right. She's fuckin' dead. She fuckin' dies and you just cash in\Nyour chips and you walk away? - At least I played a hand.\N- You played a hand and you lost. You lost a big fuckin' hand. Some people will lose a big hand like\Nthat and have the sack to ante up again. Look at me.\NWhat do you wanna do? You and your bullshit.\NYou got a bullshit answer for everybody. But I ask you a very simple question and\Nyou can't give me a straight answer, because you don't know. I'll see ya, Bo-peep. - Fuck you.\N- You're the shepherd. Shepherd. White little prick. I just wanted to,\Nyou know, um, call you up,\Nuh, before you left, um- I've been takin' all these\Njobs interviews and stuff, so I'm not gonna be just\Na construction worker. Well, you know, I never\Nreally cared about that. Yeah. I love you. Will? You take care. Will, come on.\NWill! Will, that's it!\NWe're done! I'm sitting in your office\Nand the boy isn't here. Well, it's ten past 5:00. An hour and\Nten minutes late. Well, if he doesn't show up and I file\Na report saying he wasn't here... and he goes back to jail,\Nhe won't be on my conscience. Okay. Fine. What's up? Thanks. Ah! God, that's good. So how's your lady? Ah, she's gone. Gone? Gone where? Med school.\NMedical school in California. - Really?\N- Yeah. - When was this?\N- It was, like, a week ago. That sucks. So, uh, when are you done\Nwith those meetings? I think the week\Nafter I'm 21. They gonna hook ya up\Nwith a job or what? Yeah, fuckin' sit in a room and do\Nlong division for the next 50 years. Nah, probably make\Nsome nice bank though. I'm gonna be\Na fuckin' lab rat. Better than this shit.\NWay outta here. What do I want a way\Noutta here for? I mean, I'm gonna fuckin'\Nlive here the rest of my life. You know, be neighbors.\NYou know, have little kids. Fuckin' take 'em to Little League\Ntogether up Foley Field. Look, you're my best friend,\Nso don't take this the wrong way. But in 20 years if\Nyou're still livin' here, comin' over to my house\Nto watch the Patriots games, still workin' construction,\NI'll fuckin' kill ya. That's not a threat. That's a fact.\NI'll fuckin' kill ya. What the fuck\Nare you talkin' about? - Look, you got something none of us have.\N- Oh, come on! Why is it always this? I fuckin'\Nowe it to myself to do this or that. - What if I don't want to?\N- No, no, no. Fuck you. You don't owe it to yourself. You owe it to me, 'cause tomorrow I'm gonna\Nwake up and I'll be 50, and I'll still\Nbe doin' this shit. That's all right.\NThat's fine. I mean, you're sittin' on\Na winnin' lottery ticket. You're too much of a pussy\Nto cash it in, and that's bullshit. 'Cause I'd do fuckin' anything\Nto have what you got. So would any of\Nthese fuckin' guys. Be an insult to us\Nif you're still here in 20 years. Hangin' around here\Nis a fuckin' waste of your time. - You don't know that.\N- I don't? - No. You don't know that.\N- Oh, I don't know that. Let me tell you what I do know. Every day I come by your house,\Nand I pick you up. We go out and have a few drinks\Nand few laughs, and it's great. You know what the\Nbest part of my day is? It's for about ten seconds: from when I pull\Nup to the curb and when I get to your door. 'Cause I think maybe I'll get up there and\NI'll knock on the door and you won't be there. No "good-bye," no "see ya later. "\NNo nothing. You just left. I don't know much,\Nbut I know that. This is a disaster, Sean. I brought you in here because\NI wanted you to help me with the boy, - not to run him out.\N- I know what I'm doing with the boy. I don't care if you have\Na rapport with the boy! I don't care if you have a few laughs,\Neven at my expense. - But don't you dare undermine what I'm trying to do here.\N- Undermine? This boy is at\Na fragile point right now. I do understand. He is at\Na fragile point. He's got problems. What problems does he have? That he's\Nbetter off as a janitor, in jail? Better hanging out with\Na bunch of retarded gorillas? Why do you think he does that?\NYou have any fuckin' clue why? He can handle the problems. He can\Nhandle the work. He obviously handled you. Listen to me.\NWhy is he hiding? Why doesn't\Nhe trust anybody? Because the first thing\Nthat happened to him, he was abandoned by the people\Nwho were supposed to love him the most. Don't give me\Nthat Freudian crap. Why does he hang out with those\Nretarded gorillas, as you call them? Because any one of them, if he asked\Nthem to, would take a bat to your head. - That's called loyalty.\N- Yeah, that's very touching. Who's he handling? He pushes people away\Nbefore they have a chance to leave him. It's a defense mechanism,\Nall right? For 20 years, he's been\Nalone because of that. If you push him right now, it's gonna\Nbe the same thing all over again. I'm not gonna\Nlet that happen to him. - Don't you do that.\N- What? Don't infect him with the idea that it's\Nokay to quit, that it's okay to be a failure. Because it's not okay, Sean! And if you're angry at me for being\Nsuccessful, for being what you could have been- - I'm not angry at you.\N- Oh, yes, you're angry at me. You resent me, but I'm not gonna\Napologize for any success I've had. You're angry at me for doing\Nwhat you could have done! But ask yourself, Sean-\NAsk yourself... if you want Will to feel that way-\Nif you want him to feel like a failure? You arrogant shit! That's why I don't come to the goddamn reunions,\N'cause I can't stand that look in your eye. - That condescending, embarrassed look.\N- Oh, come on, Sean. You think I'm a failure.\NI know who I am. I'm proud of what I do. It was\Na conscious choice. I didn't fuck up! And you and your cronies think\NI'm some sort of pity case. You and your kiss-ass chorus following\Nyou around going, "The Field's medal!" Why are you still so\Nfuckin' afraid of failure? It's about my medal, isn't it? Oh, God, I could\Ngo home and get it for you. You can have it. Shove the medal up\Nyour fuckin' ass, all right? 'Cause I don't give\Na shit about your medal, because I knew you before\Nyou were a mathematical god, when you were pimple-faced and homesick and\Ndidn't know what side of the bed to piss on. Yeah, you were smarter than me then\Nand you're smarter than me now. So don't blame me for\Nhow your life turned out. I don't blame you!\NIt's not about you! You mathematical dick!\NIt's about the boy! He's a good kid! And I won't see you fuck him\Nup like you're tryin' to fuck up me right now. I won't see you make him\Nfeel like a failure too! - He won't be a failure!\N- But if you push him! If you ride him! I am what I am today because I was pushed\Nand because I learned to push myself. He's not you!\NYou get that! I can come back. No, come in.\NUh, I was just leaving. A lot of that stuff goes back\Na long way between me and him. You know. Not about you. What is that? This is your file. I have to send it\Nback to the judge for evaluation. Oh. Hey, you're not\Ngonna fail me, are you? What's it say? - Wanna read it?\N- Why? Have you had any, uh,\Nexperience with that? Twenty years of counseling.\NYeah, I've seen some pretty awful shit. I mean, have you had\Nany experience with that? - Personally?\N- Yeah. Yeah, I have. It sure ain't good. My father was an alcoholic. Mean fuckin' drunk. He'd come home hammered,\Nlookin' to whale on somebody. So I'd provoke him so he wouldn't go\Nafter my mother and little brother. Interesting nights\Nwhen he wore his rings. He used to just\Nput a wrench, a stick and a belt\Non the table. - Just say, "Choose. "\N- Well, I gotta go with the belt there. I used to go with the wrench. Why the wrench? 'Cause fuck him, that's why. - Your foster father?\N- Yeah. So, uh, what is it, like,\NWill has an attachment disorder? Is it all that stuff? Fear of abandonment? Is that why I broke up\Nwith Skylar? - I didn't know you had.\N- Yeah, I did. - You wanna talk about it?\N- No. Hey, Will,\NI don't know a lot. You see this?\NAll this shit? It's not your fault. Yeah, I know that. Look at me, son. - It's not your fault.\N- I know. No. It's not\Nyour fault. I know. No, no, you don't.\NIt's not your fault. - Hmm?\N- I know. - It's not your fault.\N- All right. It's not your fault. - It's not your fault.\N- Don't fuck with me. It's not your fault. Don't fuck with me, all right?\NDon't fuck with me, Sean, not you. It's not your fault. It's not your fault. My God- My God! I'm so sorry!\NMy God! Fuck them, okay? - Can I help you?\N- Yeah, I'm Will Hunting. I'm here about a position. Could you just have\Na seat for a moment? Yes, there's\Na Mr. Hunting in the lobby. Which one did you take? I was over at McNeil. It's one of\Nthe jobs the professor set me up with. I haven't told him yet, but I went\Ndown there and talked to my boss- My new boss.\NHe seemed like a good guy. - Is that what you want?\N- Yeah, you know, I think so. Well, good for you.\NCongratulations. Thanks. Time's up. So that's- So that's it?\NSo we're done? Yeah, that's it. You're done.\NYou're a free man. Well, um, I just want you\Nto know, Sean, that- You're welcome, Will. So, you know, I hope\Nwe keep in touch, you know. Yeah, me too. I'll be travelin' around a bit.\NIt'll be a little hard, but, uh- I've got an answering machine at\Nthe college I'll be checking in with. So, here's the number. You call that.\NI'll get back to you right away. Yeah, you know,\NI figured I'm just gonna... put my money back on the table\Nand see what kind of cards I get. You do what's in your heart,\Nson. You'll be fine. - Thank you, Sean.\N- Uh- Thank you, Will. Hey, does this violate\Nthe patient-doctor relationship? Naw. Only if you\Ngrab my ass. - Take care.\N- You too. Yeah. Hey. Good luck, son. Two beers. What's up?\NDid you guys go? No. I had to talk him down. - Why didn't you yoke him?\N- Little Morgan's got a lot of scrap to him. People try to whip\Nhis ass every week. - Fuckin' kid won't back down.\N- What are you sayin' about me? - Was I talkin' to you?\NNone of your fuckin' business. - Go get me a beer.\N- I ordered two beers! - Hey, asshole.\N- What, bitch? - Happy birthday.\N- Thought we forgot, huh, bitch? - Come on!\N- I'm goin'. I'm goin'. All right. Who's first? - Come on, motherfucker!\N- Who's first? Here's your present. - Come on, bro.\N- What? Well, we knew you had to get back and\Nforth to Cambridge for your new job. I knew I wasn't gonna fuckin'\Ndrive you every day, so- - Morgan wanted to get you a "T" pass.\N- That's not what I was sayin'! But, uh, you're 21 now.
