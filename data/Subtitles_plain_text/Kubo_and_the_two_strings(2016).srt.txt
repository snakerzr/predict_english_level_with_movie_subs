If you must blink, do it now. Pay careful attention\Nto everything you see and hear, no matter how unusual it may seem. And please be warned, if you fidget, if you look away, if you forget any part of what I tell you, even for an instant, then our hero will surely perish. His name is Kubo. His grandfather stole something from him. And that really is the least of it. Ow! Well, hello, Kubo. How was it today? It wasn't a bad crowd. I got two pennies and a lint ball. This is pretty good lint. And what have you got planned for today? Oh, you know, the usual. - Monsters?\N- Of course. You think you can work\Nin a fire-breathing chicken? The chicken again? The chicken is funny. A touch of comedy to balance\Nthe whole thing out. They're gonna be throwing money\Nat you. I just know it. Uh, they'll throw something at you.\NI don't know. Okay, I'll see what I can do. And do you plan on finishing\Nthe story this time, young man? If you must blink, do it now. Yay! Pay careful attention to\Neverything you see and hear, no matter how unusual it may seem. And please be warned,\Nif you fidget, if you look away, if you forget any part of what I tell you, even for an instant,\Nthen our hero will surely perish. Hanzo was a mighty samurai,\Nbut he was alone. His family taken from him,\Nhis kingdom in ruins, and his army destroyed\Nby the dreaded Moon King. You may recall, Hanzo was\Nroaming the distant Far Lands in search of a magical suit of armor. The only weapon in the whole world that could protect him\Nfrom the power of the Moon King. This armor was made up of three pieces. - The first...\N- Oh! I know! I know! The sword unbreakable. The second... The breastplate... Impenetrable. Impenetra-bubble! Yeah! And finally, the third weapon,\Nthe final piece of the armor... I know this one. Pick me! The helmet invulnerable! Before Hanzo could claim the armor and unite the pieces\Nto reveal their true power, he was attacked by the Moon King's beast. Oh, yes! Kill the chicken! Rip it to pieces. Oh, my. Hanzo was filled with rage. His soul tormented by the grief\Nof a family stolen from him! At last, our hero was face-to-face\Nwith his nemesis, the Moon King. So, be sure to come back tomorrow. What? Oh, come on! People like an ending. Where are you going? No, you can't... You can't leave! Kubo. - Kubo.\N- Yes, Mother. I'm here. Hungry? And even though he could barely see his own hand in front of his face, Hanzo and his army of loyal samurai pressed on through the blizzard. And suddenly, as quickly\Nas it had started, the storm cleared before him. Hanzo breathed a sigh of relief,\Nfor he was home. His fortress? - The Beetle Clan castle!\N- Yes. At the very edge of the Far Lands, hidden from the Moon King\Nby powerful magic. And then what happened,\Nwhen he got to the castle? When who got to the castle? Hanzo! My father! Hanzo... Hanzo was at the castle? He... Just give me a second. I'm... No. It's gone. I can't... I'm sorry, Kubo. Perhaps I could recall a different story. Mother, what was Father like? Oh. This one is easy. Hanzo was a mighty warrior,\Nskilled with sword and bow. No, what was he really like? When he wasn't fighting,\Nwhen he was with us. He was just like you. - Like me?\N- Yes. Strong, and clever, and funny, and, oh, so handsome. - Ugh. Mother.\N- Come on! Never forget how much he loved you, Kubo. He died protecting us. - Did the Moon King...\N- Uh. Your grandfather. Did Grandfather and your sisters\Nreally kill my father? It can't be true, can it? They're family. No, they are monsters. Grandfather and my sisters\Nstole your eye, Kubo. They must never find you again. Never! You must always stay hidden\Nfrom the night sky, or they will find you\Nand they'll take you away from me. Promise me you will never let this happen. Promise me, Kubo! Don't be sad, Kubo. Kubo? Remember what you must do, Kubo? Remember? Keep you with me at all times, Mr. Monkey. And? And keep Father's robe\Non my back at all times. Yes, Kubo. And there's one more thing. Never, ever stay out after dark. Huh? Remember? - Yes, Mr. Monkey.\N- Good boy. Bedtime. Mother, wake up. You're dreaming. No. Kubo. Kubo, is that you? Yes, Mother. I'm here. Kubo, what happened to your eye? Paper boy! Here, here! Come on. Come on. Come sit next to me.\NI got us a good spot here. What do you think? I got myself all spruced up\Nfor the big day. Mmm. I do so love the festival. A time to celebrate. You know, it's a shame\Nyou never stay past sundown. There's fireworks,\Nand singing, and dancing, and feasting, of course. But the best part of all... Do you see those lamps and altars? We use those to speak to\Nthe loved ones that left us behind. We listen to their tales, and guide their safe return\Nto the blissful pure land. Really? Did you speak to someone? Yes, I did. My husband. His voice was as clear and loud as the one you use for your stories. In 72 years, he never had a thing to say. Now he's gone, I can't shut him up. You have someone you wanna talk to, huh? Very much. Well, what's stopping you? Don't I need a lamp? Well, I'll bet you could make\Na really nice one with that paper folding thing you do. You see, not just a pretty face, huh? Now, hurry along. Go! There's still time before dark. Go! Get out of here. Place the lamp at the altar. Very good. What do we do next, Daddy? Now we pray. We ask her spirit\Nto honor us with its light. Grandma, will you please honor... Shh. Softly, softly. Hello, Father. I hope you're well. I mean, I know you're dead,\Nbut I hope everything is okay. Look, it's your robe. Mother says I'll grow into it. She says you were a great leader\Nwho died protecting me. Saving one of my eyes. Two would have been ideal,\Nbut thanks anyway. Father, I'm worried about Mother. With every day that goes by,\Nshe drifts further away. She talks a lot about you, but... But I just don't know. I don't think she remembers\Nwhat's real anymore. I don't know what's real anymore. I just wish you were here, so I could talk to you, see you, find out what I should do. Daddy, Daddy, she's here! Grandma is here! Now it's time for the final part. We have to help her\Nget back to the spirit world. But she just got here. Come on. Father? Hello? Anytime. Fine! I don't need you anyway. Kubo. I'm sorry. Kubo. Kubo. Little boy. What happened to your eye? Who are you? How do you know my name? We are your family, Kubo. Your mother's sisters. And we've been looking\Nfor you for so long. It's so lovely to meet you, Kubo. Face-to-face. Come, Kubo. Come to your aunties. No reason to be afraid, Kubo. We just need your other eye. Your grandfather admires it so. Help! Help! Somebody help! Help! Look out! Run! We're here, Kubo. Your family has come for you. Kubo. Mother. Kubo, you must find the armor.\NIt's your only chance. Remember this. Mother! Mother! No! Mother! Kubo. Kubo! Can you hear me, Kubo? I said your mother is gone. Your village is destroyed.\NBurned to the ground. We landed here in the Far Lands. Your enemies aren't far behind. We must search for shelter\Nbefore your grandfather comes. We need to go now. Come on, get up, let's go. Once we're inside, you might be tempted\Nto complain about the odor. Keep in mind my sense of smell\Nis 10 times stronger than yours. You have questions, I can tell. - Who...\N- You get three. I think I have more. Three, but first you're gonna eat. Why only three? - Okay, that was your first question.\N- What? I don't understand what's happening! Who are you? You don't recognize me? All these years, you had\Nto keep me in your pack. Well, now you know why. But you were a wooden charm. You were this big. I called that charm "Mr. Monkey." And if I were alive at that point,\NI might have found that insulting. Look, your mother used the last\Nof her magic to save you and bring me to life. Here. Drink. - It smells.\N- Everything in here smells. - Drink it.\N- I don't want it. I said drink it. You're a mean monkey, aren't you? Yes. Yes, I am. And that's three. You're out of questions now,\Nso just listen. I'm here to protect you, Kubo. And that means you have to do as I say. So, if you don't eat, you'll be weak. If you're weak, you'll be slow. If you're slow, you'll die. It's too hot! Drink. Oh, excuse me. Okay, you better start\Ntaking this seriously, Kubo. This is real. This is not a story. Those things, your aunts,\Nthey never get hungry. They never sleep. They will find you! And if we're not prepared, they'll kill me and take your other eye. What are we gonna do? We're going to find the armor. It's the only thing that can protect you. So it's real. Really real. Don't worry. I'm not going to keep it. I pulled that from her head. I didn't mean to. Your mother was very powerful. She blessed your robes so that when the need was most,\Nthey would fly you away. She used the last of that power\Nto bring me to life. This bracelet, her hair, it's a memory. And memories are powerful things, Kubo. Never lose it. One more question? Last one. Do you know where it is? The armor? No. No, I don't. Now, go to sleep. Goodnight, Monkey. Kubo. Kubo. You were talking in your sleep. You were dreaming,\Ncalling out to your father, and then the paper flew out of your\Nbag and folded itself into him. He's been standing there\Nfor hours, quietly judging us. I'm not even convinced\Nthis counts as origami. I could swear scissors were involved. Ow. Back home in the cave,\Nmy mother's dreams did this, and the paper always unfolded\Nitself by morning. What's that about? What are you doing? I guess this is how my father answered me. I'm tempted to say\Nthat entrusting our fate to the guidance of a small paper man seems like a bad idea. But it's the best bad idea we have. You're growing stronger. You might not wanna look\Nquite so pleased about that. We grow stronger,\Nthe world grows more dangerous. Life has a funny way\Nof keeping things balanced. Monkey, do you ever say\Nanything encouraging? I encourage you not to die. "I encourage you not to die." Mosquitoes. Annoying. Wasn't me, I swear. Paper runs out, as does patience. I didn't ask them to do that. The second time. I didn't! At least, not exactly. I mean, I felt it, but... Magic is not meant to be easy. You need to learn control. Concentrate on what you're doing,\Nand always remember, don't mess with the monkey. Tread carefully, Kubo.\NThis isn't one of your stories. How do you know? Maybe it is. And I'm the valiant hero\Nand you're the mean monkey. Heroes come and go. Any moment, something terrible\Ncould come out of nowhere and... Monkey! Kubo! Monkey, wait. He wasn't trying to hurt me. He just wanted... - Hanzo.\N- Hanzo? Hanzo. I still think I'm gonna stab him. Why must you always assume the worst? Oh! Oh! Pardon me for not trusting\Nthis giant, spiky, insect-monster that just kidnapped you. Hanzo. Yes, I remember him. I think, maybe, he was my master. What? What did you say? We had a crest. A samurai crest. Have you seen this crest before? This is a miracle. You have our robes. You're wearing our robes! Why are you wearing our robes? He doesn't have to answer your questions. Anyway, who are you? Many years ago, I was cursed. Trapped in this cursed state. Cursed to wander the Far Lands. Cursed or curs-ed. No comrades, no master. Not even a name or a single memory of the noble warrior I once was. You used to be a man? No, not just any man. A samurai. I mean, I'm pretty certain. Look, I had the stuff. I mean, I'm either a samurai\Nor a really bad hoarder. Either way, inside my thorax\Nbeats the heart of a warrior. If you have no memory,\Nhow can you be certain of anything? Because I get flashes. They come about from objects\NI find on my travels. Sometimes it's a sound. Or a smell. You must get a lot of flashes. The memories, they fade. And all I'm left with\Nis the sense that I was once part of something much greater. Monkey, can I tell him? I really don't think that's a good idea. - He has a right.\N- Absolutely not. - But... I...\N- No "buts." No! - What? Tell me what?\N- Hanzo was my father. Kubo! This is a miracle. I have found the son of my master. - Don't even.\N- Oh. Whatever brings you to these lands,\Nwhatever your quest, it is now my quest, too. I will join you, and I will give\Nmy life for you, if necessary. Wow. You will? What? Do you think that's possible? Look, kid, I mean, I know how these\Nquests go. People die all the time. They drop like flies. That doesn't matter. 'Cause I have a feeling\Nthis is my destiny. No, it isn't! We can't trust anything you say, because you can't trust anything you say. We don't know anything about you. Monkey, you said it yourself. Our quest is a difficult one. A samurai, even a cursed one\Nwith no memory, that looks like a bug, could be helpful. Yes, I am certain I could be helpful. Indispensable. In what way? Firing an arrow into a wall\Nis hardly what I call... Impressive. Oh, look at that. Literally, the first time\NI've ever done it. Just tell me of our quest, and I will quickly demonstrate\Nmy numerous indispensabilities. Well, that's kind of a long story. You've got my attention.\NI promise I won't even blink. I actually don't think I even can blink. - Do I have eyelids?\N- Fine. Walk and talk. Hanzo has found a path. So, you used to be a toy monkey. Kubo, I really don't see\Nhow this part is important to our story. I kept her in my pocket.\NShe was only like this big. - Okay, Kubo, that's enough.\N- Tiny. And she was called "Mr. Monkey." I wasn't a toy. I was a charm. Of course you were. That doesn't look good. Don't touch anything. He did it. Okay. No. No. No. Yes. Kubo, look. The sword unbreakable. It could be a trap. Allow me. What, it's not a trap if you do it? Stealth is my middle name. You don't even have a first name. Don't worry. I got this. The mighty Beetle is victorious! I don't got this. I don't got this! Oh, for crying out loud! I invoke the sword unbreakable! It broke. So, does it just mean the handle or... I'm a little disappointed\Nwith this magic sword. It's not the right sword, you idiot! Look! The sword! It's in his head. Hey! I've got a bone to pick with you. See, because he's made of bones. You're an embarrassment. Uh... This is problematic. Enough with the arrows! Oh, foot! You can fly? Apparently, yes! Are you sure it isn't\Nthe sword unfindable? I think I found it! A hand here. Anyone? Anyone else? Kubo! - Kubo!\N- Monkey! Whoa! - No!\N- Kubo! Huh. Yes! Thank goodness that's over. Everything turning black. Then open your eyes. Oh. I can't feel my wings. You didn't even know\Nyou had them five minutes ago. Stop wriggling. Here. Is that feeling better? Oh, yeah. A little to the left. Down, just a bit. Right there. That's good. Wait, you're being nice to me. Shh. Don't tell anyone. We did it, Beetle. We got the sword. Whoa. Put that down, it's sharp! Ooh. Mmm. Okay, we're done here. Get up. We have a lot of walking to do. You can't be serious. I'm always serious. Are you two going to fight, again? Of course not.\NWe're having a grown-up conversation. You're going to fight again. Kubo, just go over there\Nand play with something. Not that! Monkey, this is the Long Lake. We can't walk around it. We need to swim across. I can carry Kubo. "Carry Kubo." That's your better idea? Look, I appreciate your help. I really do. But when it comes to the boy, - I know what's best.\N- Oh, is that right? And what's best is not to be\Nfielding ideas from a talking cockroach. This coming from a talking monkey. I can still hear you, you know. Then play louder. This conversation is over.\NMonkeys don't swim. Not to worry. Monkey see, monkey do. How long have you been\Nwaiting to say that? Ever since I met you. Hey, what were we grown-up\Nconversation-ing about? You're ridiculous.\NYou're just absolutely ridiculous. Ridiculous! Crossing the lake is a ridiculous idea. It's not your fault.\NThere's no sense left in your head. I think I resent that. I may not know everything... - Anything.\N- Anything. But I do know Kubo is more\Ncapable than you think he is. You're being a tiny\Nbit overprotective here. I'm being a lot overprotective here. It's my job to make sure Kubo\Nis safe, and that is not safe. You... You are not safe. Kubo is just a child. And an incredibly gifted one.\NHe just saved our lives. Yes, he's very powerful,\Nbut he still has much to learn! What? Well, fast learner. Did you know you could do that? Show off. Okay, now take a deep breath. Clear your mind. Guess I got that part covered. Now, draw back slowly. That's it. Close one eye.\NGuess you got that part covered. Concentrate on what is directly\Nin front of you. Let everything else fall away. And release! Yeah! Perfect shot! Not bad. And what's your plan for getting\Nthe fish into the boat, so we can actually eat it? Well, I said I was teaching him\Nhow to shoot, not fish. Fishing is tomorrow's lesson. - Give me that.\N- Whoa. Grabby monkey. Now try it. Pull back and... Whoo-hoo! A rope. It's a pretty good idea. Hmm. And you're not an awful shot. Okay, now you two are being weird. Um... We're going to need\Nsomething to cut this with. Sword unbreakable. Must you play with your food? Yes. What's the matter, Kubo? You act like you've never had a meal sitting between a monkey\Nand a beetle before. I've never had a meal sitting\Nbetween anyone before. Come on, eat. You need energy. And this is much better than whale soup. Kubo, question. Before you started on your heroic\Nquest, what were you like? Well, I looked after my mother mostly. And I told stories about mighty\Nwarriors seeking revenge with battles, and monsters, and magic. I was pretty good at telling them. Not so good at ending them. Sometimes I would tell my mother\Nstories about little things. Like skimming rocks across the river or catching fireflies\Nin the mulberry fields. And when I told those stories,\NI could see her eyes were mostly clear. I could tell she saw me. Really saw me. I could see her, too. Her real self. Her spirit trying to fight its way out. It was beautiful. You know something, Kubo? Back when you just told stories,\Nbefore you went on this great adventure, you were still very much a hero. We're gonna have to head for shore. Find a hiding place and... The second piece of armor. The breastplate. It's down there? Okay, I got it. - Beetle, wait!\N- No, don't worry. Beetles can hold their breath\Nunder water for a very long time. What? Since when? It's a well-known fact, Monkey. So, you don't remember anything\Nat all, but beetles swimming? That's what sticks in there? No, Beetle. My mother told me\Na story about the Long Lake. There's something under the water. Oh, yeah? Um... What kind of something? She said there was a garden of eyes, eyes that stare into you, into your soul. They show you secrets, things\Nto keep you down there with them. Forever. Okay. Well, I won't look\Ndirectly into anyone's eyes, even if I'm being incredibly sincere. You're gonna miss me, Monkey. Be careful. He's searching for the armor\Njust like his insolent father. Yes, sister. Then we must ensure he\Ndoes not find what remains. Monkey, I think he's in trouble! We should help him. Kubo, your aunts are still out there.\NI'm sorry. But we have to head for shore. Kubo! Kubo. Look at this. I come fishing and all I reel in\Nis a stinking ape. How pathetic that this filthy creature is all that's left of my sister's magic. This filthy creature will tear you apart! Kubo. Kubo? I have crushed creatures who could\Nfit this world on their fingernail. This victory brings me no honor. Imagine how you're going\Nto feel when you lose. I felt loss only once. Eleven years ago, I lost my sister. She fell in love with a fool\Nand betrayed our father! She was an ungrateful coward! Who's the coward now? I got it! I got it! Beetle, what happened? Where's Kubo? Um... Uh-oh. Get back down there! He's in trouble! I got it. Mother. Mother. Mother. Mother. Mother. It never fails to amaze me how the creatures down here fight\Nso hard just to die another day. Down here, there are\Ndays worth fighting for. There is nothing down here worth anything! It's pathetic what happened to my sister. I looked up to her. She was so strong. And love made her weak. No! It made me stronger. Over here. The eyes... It was the eyes. They had him in a trance. Oh, no. No. Come on. Come on, Kubo. Wake up. Please wake up! Please, please wake up. It's gonna be all right. It's gonna be all right. I'm here. I'm right here. I saw... What? What did you see? I saw... Mother. My son. So, you must look\Nmore like your dad, then? You're staring. Let me guess. You have questions. - Why...\N- I'll start. First question.\NIf I'm Beetle and you're Monkey, why isn't he called "Boy"? Oh, boy. Questions can wait. We need sleep. Tell us your story, then we can sleep. Please? Okay. Perhaps you can help me. The night I met your father... Mother. My sisters and I went to the Temple\Nof Bones to kill Hanzo. Oh, right. At the bidding of the Moon King, my sisters and I had\Ncome down from the night sky and killed many noble warriors. Your grandfather told us that any man who found the magical armor would grow too powerful\Nand be a threat to the heavens. That night, I arrived\Nat the temple before my sisters. And there he was, the mighty Hanzo. "You have offended my father," I told him. "Now you must die." Yeah, that's so you. Beetle. Shh! We fought. Hanzo was strong. But then he stopped. He looked into my eyes\Nand uttered four simple words. These words changed everything. "I love you, "Monkey"? "You are my quest," he whispered. I had seen the wonders of the universe, but the warmth of his gaze\Nas I looked into his eyes... That... That I had never known. It was his humanity I saw. And it was more powerful\Nthan anything in my cold realm. In recognizing his compassion,\NI recognized my own. I spared his life. He gave me mine. And... And then he gave me you. But your grandfather found us. His rage at my betrayal shook the heavens. Your father and his army gave their lives, allowing me to escape with you in my arms. Why does Grandfather hate me? Oh, Kubo... He doesn't hate you. He wants to make you just like him. Blind to humanity, as I once was. Only then can you take your place\Nbeside him as part of his family. Cold and hard. And perfect. I'll never be like him, never. I know. He's exhausted. Mmm. Me, too. I'm not tucking you in. You're hurt. It's just a scratch. Monkey, why didn't you tell him\Nsooner who you really are? The magic that keeps me here, it's fading. Soon I'll be gone. And then Kubo will be alone again. Not alone. He is the son of Hanzo. I will do everything I can\Nto keep him from harm. Thank you, Beetle. To know Kubo has someone\Nto watch over him when I'm gone. That would be a fine way to end my story. Your story will never end. It will be told by him\Nand by the people he shares it with. And by the people they share it with. And by the people they share it with,\Nand by the people they share it with. - And by the people...\N- Beetle. The point is your story will live on in him. Hello, my young friend. Why don't you join in my song? But how did you... - You're...\N- Even blinder than you? Twice as much, to be precise. Which means I see double the truth. This is all a dream. Is this a good dream or a bad one? See for yourself. My father's fortress. Yes. The last piece of the armor. It's here? Follow the setting sun and you'll find it, in the place that\Nmight have been your home. Claim your birthright, Kubo. Give this story a happy ending. Mother! Beetle! Wake up! I'm up. I'm up. Well, I'm down. Off. I think I slept on something. Sword uncomfortable. The helmet, I know where it is. I saw it in a dream, Beetle. A dream? Well, it doesn't mean\Nanything in particular. I mean, I dreamed I fought a giant\Nskeleton with swords in its head. That really happened. Oh, yeah. Beetle. Come on, this way. I spy with my one eye\Nsomething beginning with "S." - Snow?\N- No. Snowflake? - No.\N- Okay. Oh. Pfft. Snow covered trees. Nothing to do with snow. How about "serious"? Stupid. Okay, I got it. Snow. He said it wasn't "snow." It's a song. Well, that's not fair. How do you see a song? You look. Golden heron. It's believed they hold\Nthe souls of the departed, carrying them over\Nto wherever they need to go. Hmm. What are they singing? It's beautiful. Many say the song's about\Nwhat happens when we die. How we don't just disappear. We don't? Uh, so, what happens to us? Well, like Kubo's paper, we shift. We transform so we can continue\Nour story to another place. The end of one story is merely\Nthe beginning of another. I remember this place. This was where my father\Nprepared for his quest. There's something I don't understand. Why would the helmet be here? Kubo! Release us! Oh, sister. I remember how we looked up to you. Of all of us, you shone the brightest. Such a waste. All we ever wished was to be\Na family in our home among the stars. I think we have very different\Ndefinitions of family. Don't you touch him, you witch! And then there's you, the thieving insect\Nwho stole my sister's soul. What? Oh, this is precious. You've been together all this time\Nand you haven't even realized? You took her from us. It was only fitting\Nwe took something from you. How swiftly those memories\Nspilled from your head, wiping out all recollection\Nof your obscene union. Hanzo. What? Hanzo? I... I didn't know. No! I'm forgetting what I came here for. Mother! Shh. It's okay. I'm here. Father? My son. Seems I'm married to a bug. Yeah. But a samurai bug. You are my quest. You always have been. Hanzo, keep him safe, no matter what. I promise I will. No! Fly home, Kubo. Kubo? Is that you? You have to leave this place. The Moon King, he's coming. Grandfather! It's me, Kubo! I know you can see me! Hello, grandson. It's so good to see you at last. So to speak. And I see you found the armor. Seems your mother had a reason to bring you to this\Ndreadful place after all. I see. I know you do. That's how this all began.\NYou finally saw me. It was my fault.\NI should've listened to my parents. Kubo, we both want the exact same thing. You want to take my other eye.\NThat's what you want! Well, yes. But do you know why I want it? Because you're old, and mean, and cruel. Oh, now, that's a little harsh. As long as you cling\Nto that silly, useless eye, you can't come up to live with me. In the heavens. You'll be stuck down here in this hell, staring with that lonely eye\Nat hate and heartache and suffering and death. Where I want to take you, we have none of those things. It'll just be you with your family. Where you belong. My family is gone. - You killed them.\N- No... They brought their fates upon themselves! They disgraced me and upset\Nthe order of everything! That's how your story goes. Oh, Kubo... When you're up there with me,\Nyou will be beyond stories. You will be immortal. You will be infinite. No. You're wrong, not infinite. All stories have an end. Is that right? And how does this story end? I kill you. Oh. Very well. Is this your wish, to do battle with a hideous monster\Nwho ruined your life, to prove your worth\Nlike your doomed father? How mortal. You want to be human? Then share their weakness! Suffer their humiliation! Feel their pain! This is the end of your story. Now, take one last\Nlook with that lonely eye, one last look at this wretched\Nplace you call home. I'm not leaving. For every horrible thing down here,\Nthere's something far more beautiful. My mother saw it. So did my father. I see it. Even with just one eye. Then I'll just have to\Nrip it out of your head again, won't I? If you must blink, do it now. I know why you want my eye. Because without it, I can't look into\Nthe eyes of another and see their soul. - Their love...\N- Everything you loved is gone! Everything you knew\Nhas been taken from you! No. It's in my memories. The most powerful kind of magic there is. It makes us stronger than you'll ever be. These are the memories\Nof those we have loved and lost. And if we hold their stories\Ndeep in our hearts, then you will never\Ntake them away from us. And that really is the least of it. Where am I? Hello, Grandfather. Oh, hello. What happened to your eye? Don't you remember? No, I... I'm sorry, young man. But I seem to have forgotten my story. Can you help me? I'll tell him. No, we'll all tell him. We'll tell him everything\Nhe needs to know. You are the kindest, sweetest man to ever live in this village. - Oh. Oh, really?\N- Yes. Uh... Uh... Every day, you walk around smiling\Nand handing out coins to children. Like me! And old women. Oh. You... You taught my kids to swim. What? And you give blankets to the poor. You're a good man. - You fed the hungry.\N- You always lend a helping hand. You're a great example. It turns out I'm pretty selfless. That's why we love you. You know, we have something in common. We both adore your grandson. His name is Kubo. Kubo? I'm sorry. But I... But I don't remember. Well... Your grandson's a storyteller. He'll tell you all the stories\Nyou've forgotten. Really? Of course. Hello, Mother. Father. I know my stories can tend\Nto get a little, um, long, so I'll keep this brief. I'm very grateful I've had\Nthe chance to meet you both, hear your wisdom, feel your kindness, even eat a meal sitting between you. This was a happy story. But it could still be a whole lot happier. I don't know exactly what the rules are or how this works,\Nbut if there were any way to... You know, I still need you. So I can say this has been\Na happy story, or I could feel it. We could all feel it. Then we could end this story. Together. The end.
