It keeps going straight to voicemail. Well, there has to be an explanation. Sweetie, it's Vegas.\NYou lose track of time in casinos. There's no windows, there's no clocks.\NHe's probably on a heater. And you never walk away from the table\Nwhen you're on a heater. You do if you're getting married. [CELL PHONE RINGS] - Hello?\N- Ahem, Tracy, it's Phil. Phil, where the hell are you guys? [OVER PHONE]\NI'm freaking out. Yeah, listen. Uh... We fucked up. - What are you talking about?\N- The bachelor party, the whole night. It... Things got out of control, uh... ...and we lost Doug. - What?\N- We can't find Doug. What are you saying, Phil?\NWe're getting married in five hours. Yeah. That's not gonna happen. MAN:\NTo my left a little. Thank you. Okey-dokey. - Whoa, watch it, pervert!\N- Alan, he's just doing your inseam. - He's getting very close to my shaft.\N- All done. You can change now. Right. Thanks, Floyd.\NThank you very much. All right, buddy,\Nwe should get a move on. You know, Doug, I was thinking... If you wanna go to Vegas without me,\Nthat is totally cool, you know? What are you talking about? You know, Phil and Stu, they're\Nyour buddies, and it's your bachelor party. Come on, Alan. Those two love you. ALAN: And also, I don't want you to feel\Nlike you have to hold back... ...because your wife's brother's there.\NI just... It's not like that. It's not like that. I already told you, Alan. Okay? We're just spending the night\Nin Vegas. It's no big deal. Besides, you're not just my wife's brother,\Nyou're my brother now. I want you to know, Doug,\NI'm a steel trap. Whatever happens tonight,\NI will never, ever, ever, speak a word of it. Okay. Yeah, I got it. Thank you.\NI don't think that... Seriously. I don't care what happens. - I don't care if we kill someone.\N- What? You heard me. It's Sin City. [WHISPERING]\NI won't tell a soul. Okay. I got it. - Thank you.\N[IN NORMAL VOICE] No, thank you. I love you so much. - Ha. I knew it.\N- Dad. Oh, stop it, I'm just jerking around. Alan, put some pants on.\NYou have weird legs. Yes, Daddy. - His legs look fine, Dad.\N- Oh, please. He has his mother's legs. It's just freaky. Alan, I'm just teasing.\NYou have wonderful legs. They're better than your mother's.\NThey're beautiful. Can you believe this?\NJust two more days. DOUG:\NI know. You getting nervous? - You wanna back out?\N- Shut up. Just tell me. Oh. Mm. You know, I don't need to go to Vegas.\NIt's dumb. It's not dumb. It's one night.\NHave fun, you deserve it. I know, but we should have\Ngone last weekend. We have so much to do.\NL... I'm gonna cancel. My brother packed his bag two weeks ago.\NYou're not canceling. - Really?\N- Yeah. - Two weeks?\N- Yeah, he's excited. Thanks again for bringing him,\Nby the way. You don't need to thank me,\Nit's nothing. He's a cool guy. It's not nothing\Nand he's not a cool guy... ...so thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Hey, Sid. I just wanted to thank you guys again\Nfor everything you're doing this weekend. - We couldn't be more excited.\N- Ah, that's great. Yeah, okay. You love us\Nand we love you. Terrific. So talk to me about Vegas. - Uh... It should be pretty mellow.\N- Mm-hm. Do some gambling, maybe catch some rays,\Nhave a few laughs. Yeah, some laughs. I got you. How you getting out there? Uh, we're gonna take my car.\NGonna pick up my friends after this. - Prius? You're taking a Prius to Vegas?\N- Yeah. You know, when you go to Vegas... ...you gotta go to Vegas. DOUG:\NNo. Sid. - Really?\NSID: Come on, we're family now. - You sure? I mean, you love this car.\N- Doug, it's just a car. Just make sure to put some Armor All\Non the tires so the sand doesn't seep in. Absolutely. That's easy. Oh, and, uh, don't let Alan drive,\Nbecause there's something wrong with him. DOUG:\NUnderstood. Oh, and Phil either. I don't like him. I will be the only one driving this car.\NI promise. Good. Remember, what happens in Vegas\Nstays in Vegas. Ah! [CHUCKLES] Except for herpes.\NThat shit'll come back with you. [SCHOOL BELL RINGS] All right. Hold on. I still need\Nsome of your permission slips... ...and $90 for the field trip\Nto the Griffith Observatory next weekend. Pay now, or forever regret missing out\Non the experience of a lifetime, guys. You're good, you got it. STUDENT: Thanks, Mr. Wenneck.\NPHIL: Thank you. Hey. You really came through,\Nthank you. Whoa, Max. What gives?\NWhat, no planetarium? My mom won't give me the money.\NI'm grounded. - Well, how much you got on you?\N- I don't know. Like, 20 bucks. Well, give me the 20\Nand I'll cover the rest. - Really?\N- Yeah. Well, we'll talk about it. But give me the 20\Nso I know you're serious. - Cool. Thanks, Mr. Wenneck.\N- Yeah. STUDENT:\NHold on, I got it. Ahem, do you have to park so close? - Yeah. What's wrong?\N- I shouldn't be here. Why is that, Alan? I'm not supposed to be within 200 feet\Nof a school. - What?\N- Or a Chuck E. Cheese. BUDNICK: Mr. Wenneck, I was...\N- It's the weekend. I don't know you. You do not exist. - Shit.\NDOUG: Heh, heh, heh. - Nice car.\NDOUG: Yeah. - I'm driving.\NDOUG: Whoa, no chance, buddy... Don't step... God. Watch the leath... Shut up and drive before these nerds\Nask me another question. - Animal.\N- Who's this? - It's Alan. Tracy's brother.\N- I met you, like, four times. Oh, yeah. How you doing, man? MELISSA:\NDon't forget your Rogaine. STU:\NRogaine, check. And don't forget to use it. I can totally tell when you forget,\Nyour hair just looks thinner. Using of the Rogaine, check. Make sure to call me\Nright when you get to the hotel... ...not like that conference in Phoenix. I had to wait two hours\Nfor you to call me. Yeah, I was the keynote speaker.\NI was late to the podium. - Still?\N- Yeah, you're totally right. I'm sorry. - What is the matter?\NMELISSA: I don't know. I hope you're not gonna go to\Nsome strip club when you're up there. STU:\NMelissa, we're going to Napa Valley. I don't even think they have strip clubs\Nin wine country. Well, I'm sure if there is one,\NPhil will sniff it out. [SIGHS] It's not gonna be like that. Besides, you know how I feel about that. I know, I know. It's just boys\Nand their bachelor parties, it's gross. You're right, it is gross. Mm-mm. And you know what else, honestly? Why would I risk this for,\Nyou know, a couple of minutes... ...of some 19-year-old hard body\Nin a schoolgirl outfit? - Yeah.\N- Why would I ever need, like... - You're right. And if you ever do...\N- What? ...I will fucking kick your ass. Thank you. Thank you for that. That is exactly what I needed to hear. Not to mention it's pathetic. Those places are filthy.\NAnd the worst part is... ...that little girl... ...grinding and dry humping\Nthe fucking stage up there... ...that's somebody's daughter up there.\N- I was just gonna say that. See? I just wish your friends\Nwere as mature as you. They are mature, actually.\NYou just have to get to know them better. PHIL:\NPaging Dr. Faggot. Dr. Faggot! - I should go.\N- That's a good idea, Dr. Faggot. Have a good weekend.\NI'm gonna miss you. Whoo! Road trip! [SCREAMS] Vegas! Vegas, baby! Vegas! [LAUGHS] You're nuts! Come on, just till Barstow.\NEverybody's passing us. Absolutely not. I promised Sid.\NI will be the only one driving this car. Besides, you're drinking. Oh, what are you, a cop now?\NYou know I drive great when I'm drunk. True. Don't forget,\NPhil was always our designated drunk driver. Yeah. You wanna explain it\Nto them, Alan? Guys, my dad loves this car\Nmore than he loves me, so, yeah. Aw, whatever. I left my wife and kid\Nat home so I could go with you guys. - You know how difficult that was?\N- That's really sweet. - Yeah.\N- Dude, I was being sarcastic. I fucking hate my life. - I may never go back. I might stay in Vegas.\N- Here we go. Doug, enjoy yourself,\Nbecause come Sunday... ...you're gonna start dying\Njust a little bit every day. Yeah. That's why I've managed\Nto stay single this whole time, you know? - Oh, really? That's why you're single?\N- Yeah. Cool. Good to know. - Am I all right over there, Alan?\N- Yeah, you're good. [TRUCK HONKS] [TIRES SQUEAL] DOUG:\NAw, Jesus Christ! - Oh, my God!\N- That was awesome! That was not awesome.\NWhat's wrong with you? - That was insane. We almost just died.\N- You should have seen your face. - Classic.\N- That's funny. Ha-ha. It's not funny. [MAN WHISTLES] - Boy, you've got a sweet ride there.\N- Don't touch it. Don't even look at it. Go on, get out. You heard me.\NDon't look at me, either. Yeah, you better walk on. - He's actually kind of funny.\N- Yeah, he means well. ALAN:\NI'll hit an old man in public. Is he all there? Like, mentally? I think so. He's just an odd guy.\NYou know, he's kind of weird. - I mean, should we be worried?\N- No. - All right.\N- No. Tracy did mention\Nthat we shouldn't let him gamble. Or drink too much. Jesus, he's like a gremlin.\NComes with instructions and shit. STU:\NAnd one water. - All good with Melissa?\N- Oh, yeah. Told her we're two hours\Noutside of wine country, and she bought it. You think it's strange you've been\Nin a relationship for years... ...and you have to lie about Vegas? Yeah, I do.\NBut trust me, it's not worth the fight. Oh, so you can't go to Vegas but she can\Nfuck a bellhop on a Carnival Cruise Line? Hey. Okay, first of all, he was a bartender. And she was wasted. And, if you must know,\Nhe didn't even come inside her. And you believe that? Uh, yeah, I do believe that,\Nbecause she's grossed out by semen. That'll be 32.50. It's 32.50, you gonna pay for it? It says here we should work in teams.\NWho wants to be my spotter? I don't think you should be doing\Ntoo much gambling tonight, Alan. Gambling?\NWho said anything about gambling? It's not gambling\Nwhen you know you're gonna win. Counting cards is a foolproof system. It's also illegal. It's not illegal, it's frowned upon,\Nlike masturbating on an airplane. [CHUCKLES] I'm pretty sure that's illegal too. Yeah, maybe after 9/11,\Nwhere everybody got so sensitive. Thanks a lot, Bin Laden. Either way, you gotta be super smart\Nto count cards, buddy, okay? ALAN: Oh, really?\N- It's not easy. Well maybe we should tell that\Nto Rain Man... ...because he practically bankrupted\Na casino, and he was a retard. What? He was a retard. Retard. PHIL:\NHere we go. WOMAN:\NHi, welcome to Caesars. STU: Hello.\NWOMAN: Checking in? Yeah. We have a reservation\Nunder Dr. Price. LISA:\NOkay, let me look that up for you. Dr. Price? Stu, you're a dentist, okay?\NDon't try and get fancy. - It's not fancy if it's true.\N- He's a dentist. Don't get too excited. And if, uh, someone has a heart attack,\Nyou should still call 911. We'll be sure to do that. Can I ask you a question?\NDo you know if the hotel's pager-friendly? - What do you mean?\N- I'm not getting a sig on my beeper. - I'm not sure.\NALAN: Is there a payphone bank? Bunch of payphones? Business. Um, there's a phone in your room. That'll work. So I have you in a two-bedroom suite\Non the 12th floor, is that okay? It sounds perfect. Actually, I was wondering\Nif you had any villas. - We're not even gonna be in the room.\N- It's unnecessary. No big deal. We can share beds.\NIt's one night. If we're share beds,\NI'm bunking with Phil. - You good with that?\N- No, I'm not. Guys, we are not sharing beds.\NWhat are we, 12 years old? Lisa, I apologize.\NHow much is the villa? Well, we have one villa available,\Nand it's 4200 for the night. - Is it awesome?\N- It's pretty awesome. - We'll take it. Give her your credit card.\N- I can't give her my credit card. - We'll split it.\N- Are you crazy? No, this is on us. You don't get it.\NMelissa checks my statements. We just need a credit card on file. We won't charge you until check out,\Nso you can figure it out then. That's perfect. Thank you, Lisa.\NWe'll deal with it tomorrow. Come on. Fine. - Can I ask you another question?\NLISA: Sure. You probably get this a lot. This isn't the real Caesars Palace,\Nis it? What do you mean? Did, uh... - Did Caesar live here?\N- Um, no. I didn't think so. STU:\NHoly shit. [PHIL GROANS] PHIL:\NNow, this is Vegas. DOUG:\NOh, my... This place is enormous. PHIL:\NNow we're talking. Is this all one suite? Thank you, guys. Or should I say, "Thank you, Stu"? You're welcome.\NIt's only because I love you. Hey, guys. Look, free almonds. - Oh, no, no, no. Please put those back.\N- Wait, I'm just hungry. - Well, I know, but...\N- Stu, what the fuck? It's a pressure-sensitive plate. When you pick\Nit up, you have 30 seconds to put it back... ...or they bill you.\NALAN: That's pretty neat. STU: It may be neat,\Nbut it's also very expensive, so... Those almonds are probably, like, $14. Stu, relax. Phil, Melissa is like\Na forensic accountant, okay? She scours my statements.\NIf you want nuts... ...put your own credit card down.\N- Watch this. Problem solved.\NAlan, enjoy your almonds. I don't want them. He ruined it. All right, let's pick a room, let's get\Ndressed. Be ready in 30 minutes. I just wish you could see this place,\Nbecause you, of all people, would love it. Yeah. No, it's so quaint. Yeah, no, there's no TVs, no phones. They just have these cute little antique\Nradios in all the rooms. Yeah. What else? Um... We met the, uh, proprietor. - Oh, I bet you...\NSTU: What's his name? Um, Caesar. Palacé. Yeah, like the salad. Okay. Well, listen, I gotta go,\Nbecause we're gonna hit this wine tasting. Wait, wait. I love you. Okay. Bye. I'm not even gonna say anything,\Nit's so embarrassing. - Where's Alan?\N- He, uh, he went downstairs. He said he had to grab a few things. Good, because I have something\Nto show you. DOUG:\NUh-Oh. - What the hell is that?\NSTU: What do you think? If it's what I think it is,\NI think it's a big fucking mistake. I'm gonna propose to Melissa\Nat your wedding. After the ceremony. - Stuey, congratulations!\N- Thank you, Doug. - That's a beautiful ring.\N- Yeah. It's my grandmother's. She made it all the way through\Nthe Holocaust with that thing. Wait, have you not listened\Nto anything I have ever said? Phil, we've been dating for three years.\NIt's time. This is how it works. A, that is bullshit.\NAnd B, she is a complete bitch. Hey, that's his fiancée. What? It's true. It's true.\NYou know it's true. She beats him. That was twice, and I was out of line. She's strong-willed. And I respect that. Wow. Wow. He's in denial.\NNot to mention, she fucked a sailor. DOUG:\NHey, he wasn't a sailor. He was a bartender on a cruise ship.\NYou know that. Guys, I'm standing right here.\NSo I can hear everything that you're saying. Hey, guys. You ready to let the dogs out? - What?\N- Do what? ALAN:\NLet the dogs out. You know. [SINGING "WHO LET THE DOGS OUT"] Who brought this guy? DOUG: Yes, Alan, we are ready\Nto let the dogs out. - Hey, congrats.\N- Thank you. I love this fucking town. - You're not really wearing that, are you?\N- Wearing what? The man-purse. You're actually gonna wear that\Nor are you guys fucking with me? It's where I keep all my things.\NI get a lot of compliments on this. Plus, it's not a man-purse.\NIt's called a satchel. Indiana Jones wears one. So does Joy Behar. - We're going up, guys.\N- Yeah, that's perfect. STU:\NReally? We're going up? I'm just saying,\Nit's clearly marked, okay? We are definitely\Nnot supposed to be up here. Come on, we're paying for a villa.\NWe can do whatever the fuck we want. - Yeah, but...\N- Just wedge the door open. - Guys, come on up here.\N- Fine. DOUG:\NHow the hell did you find this place? Don't worry about it. Oh! - You all right?\N- Yeah. - Look at the view up here.\N- You happy? - This is great.\N- Whoa! [PHIL CHUCKLES] Are you kidding? PHIL: Alan, how we doing, buddy?\N- Good. DOUG: What do you got over there, Alan?\NSTU: That's the Eiffel Tower. Uh-oh. - Right?\N- A little Jägermeister. - Good idea.\N- There it is. Good call. On the roof. Um, no, this is good.\NI'd like to make a toast. To Doug and Tracy. May tonight be... ...but a minor speed bump... ...in an otherwise very long\Nand healthy marriage. - Cheers.\N- Cheers. Short and sweet. DOUG:\NOh, it's like college. - All right. I wanna talk about something.\NDOUG: All right. - I want to...\NALAN: I'd like to... I'd like to say something... ...that I prepared... ...tonight.\N- All right, Alan. "Hello. How about that ride in? I guess that's why they call it\NSin City. [ALAN CHUCKLES] You guys might not know this,\Nbut I consider myself a bit of a loner. I tend to think of myself\Nas a one-man wolf pack. But when my sister brought Doug home,\NI knew he was one of my own. And my wolf pack, it grew by one. So were there two...\NSo there were two of us in the wolf pack. I was alone first in the pack,\Nand then Doug joined in later. And six months ago... ...when Doug introduced me to you guys,\NI thought: 'Wait a second. Could it be? '\NAnd now, I know for sure. I just added two more guys\Nto my wolf pack." - All right.\N- All right. ALAN:\N"Four of us wolves... ...running around the desert together\Nin Las Vegas... ...looking for strippers and cocaine." So tonight... ...I make a toast.\N- Whoa. - What...?\N- What do you got there? PHIL: Dude, what the fuck?\NDOUG: What the hell are you doing? [ALAN GROANS] - What is that?\N- Blood brothers. - Don't... Why did you...?\N- Damn it. - Here.\N- Alan... - No.\N- No, I'm not doing that. ALAN: Go ahead, Stuart.\N- Make him stop. Alan, we're not gonna cut ourselves.\NGive me the knife. Slowly. Thank you.\NOkay. Thank you very much. PHIL: You all right? Are you okay?\NALAN: Mm-hm. - Do you need a doctor?\N- He's good. PHIL: You sure?\NALAN: I'm good. All right, good,\Nbecause I need everybody to focus. I wanna take a moment, I wanna talk\Nabout some... I wanna talk about memory. No, better yet,\NI wanna talk about selective memory. You see, whatever happens here tonight\Nmay as well never have happened at all... ...because this circle's about as far\Nas it's ever gonna go. In other words, forget everything. [CHUCKLES] Doug, I'm serious. I got a wife and kid. Okay, good or bad, we don't remember\Nso we got nothing to talk about. Nothing, guys. Nothing. Deal? - Deal.\NSTU: Deal. - Perfect. Alan, come here, buddy.\NSTU: Get in here, crazy. All right, to a night\Nwe'll never remember... ...but the four of us\Nwill never forget. STU: There it is.\NPHIL: Hear, hear. DOUG:\NHey, thanks, guys. [GRUNTS & GROANS] [ALAN GRUNTS] [GROWLING] Hm. Stupid tiger. [GASPS] [TIGER ROARS] [ALAN AND PHIL GRUNT] PHIL:\NWhat the fuck? Control yourself, man.\NGoddamn, will you put on some pants? - Phil, do not go in the bathroom.\N- AI, just calm down. It's me. Phil, there is a tiger in the bathroom. - What's going on?\N- There's a jungle cat in the bathroom! - Okay, okay, Al. Al, I'll check it out.\NALAN: Don't go in. Don't go in, don't go in.\NBe careful. Don't, don't. [TIGER GROWLS] - Oh! Holy fuck! He's not kidding.\NALAN: See? See? - There's a tiger in there.\N- No, there isn't. Yeah! - It's big. Gigantic.\N- You okay, buddy? No. I am in so much pain right now. Goddamn. Look at this place. Whew. I know. Phil, they have my credit card\Ndownstairs. I am so screwed. How does a tiger get in the bathroom?\NIt almost killed me. Hey, bro?\NYou mind putting on some pants? I find it a little weird\NI have to ask twice. ALAN: Pants at a time like this?\NI don't have any p... What the fuck happened last night? Hey, Phil, am I missing a tooth? I can't... Oh, shit. Oh, my God. My lateral incisor's... It's gone! It's okay. Okay, okay. Just calm down.\NWe're fine. Everything's fine. Alan, go wake up Doug. Let's get some coffee and get the fuck\Nout of Nevada before housekeeping shows. What am I gonna tell Melissa? I lost a tooth.\NI have no idea how it happened. You're freaking me out, man. I got a massive headache, okay?\NLet's just calm down. How am I supposed to calm down?\NLook around you. - Hey, guys, he's not in there.\N- Did you check all the rooms? Yeah, I looked everywhere.\NPlus, his mattress is gone. He probably went to the pool\Nto get something to eat. I'll just call his cell. I look like a nerdy hillbilly. [CELL PHONE RINGING] - Hello?\N- Alan. Hey. - It's Phil.\N- Oh, hey, Phi... This is Doug's phone.\NThis is Doug's phone. PHIL: No shit.\N- Yeah. [BABY CRYING] What the fuck is that? Whose fucking baby is that? Alan, are you sure you didn't see\Nanyone else in the suite? Yeah, I checked all the rooms.\NNo one's here. Check its collar or something. Shh. Shh. - It's okay, baby.\N- Stu, we don't have time for this. Let's go hook up with Doug,\Nwe'll deal with the baby later. Phil, we're not gonna leave a baby\Nin the room. - There's a fucking tiger in the bathroom.\N- It's not our baby. Yeah, I gotta side with Stu on this one. All right, fine.\NOkay, we'll take it with us. Could you at least just find some pants? Why can't we remember a goddamn thing\Nfrom last night? Because we obviously\Nhad a great fucking time. Why don't you just stop worrying\Nfor one minute? Be proud of yourself. I don't know, Phil.\NMaybe it's because I'm missing a tooth. Or maybe it's because\Nthere's a tiger in our hotel room... ...which, incidentally,\Nis completely destroyed. Oh, no, no. Wait, wait, wait, I know. Maybe it's because we found a baby,\Na human baby. That's it. That's it. It's because we found a fucking baby. - You shouldn't curse around the child.\N- Really? You shouldn't be around a child. [ELEVATOR BELL DINGS] Oh, how cute. What's his name? - Ben.\N- Carlos. Carlos? Thank you. Hey, Phil, look. [ALAN LAUGHING] He's jacking his little weenis. - Pull yourself together, man.\N- Not at the table, Carlos. [ALAN & PHIL CHUCKLE] I looked everywhere. Gym, casino, front desk.\NNobody's seen Doug. He's not here. He's fine. He's a grown man. Seriously, Stu, you gotta calm down.\NHere, have some juice. I can't have juice right now. Okay. All right.\NLet's just track this thing. [PHIL COUGHS] What's the last thing\Nwe remember doing last night? Well, the first thing was\Nwe were on the roof... ...and were having those shots of Jäger. [RETCHES & COUGHS] And then we ate dinner\Nat The Palm. Right? That's right. And then we played craps at\Nthe Hard Rock, and I think Doug was there. That sounds right.\NNo, no. He definitely was. You know what, guys?\NI don't even remember going to dinner. What the fuck?\NI don't think I've ever been this hung-over. After the Hard Rock, I blacked out.\NIt was like emptiness. [LAUGHS] Okay. We have up until 10 p. M... ...so that gives us a 12-hour window\Nwhere we could have lost him. ALAN: What is this?\N- Oh, my God. That is my tooth. Why do you have that?\NWhat else is in your pockets? This is a good thing. No.\NCheck your pockets. Check your pockets. Do you have anything? I have an ATM receipt\Nfrom the Bellagio. Eleven-oh-five for $800!\NI am so fucked. I have a valet ticket from Caesars.\NLooks like we got in at 5:15 a.m. Oh, shit. We drove last night? [ALAN LAUGHS] Driving drunk. Classic. [LAUGHS] What's on your arm? - What the fuck is that?\N- Jesus, Phil. - You were in the hospital last night.\N- I guess so, yeah. - You okay?\N- Yeah, Alan. I'm fine. What the hell is going on? Well, Stu, Stu, this is a good thing.\NWe have a lead now. Hey, Stu, watch this. [LAUGHS] [CHUCKLES] - You ever seen a baby do that?\N- Dude, Alan, not cool. So, uh, are you sure you're qualified\Nto be taking care of that baby? What? I've found a baby before. - You found a baby before?\N- Yeah. - Where?\N- Coffee Bean. STU:\NWait, what? Hey, Phil? I don't think Doug\Nwould want us to take the Mercedes. Relax, we'll be careful. My dad is crazy about that car.\NHe left Doug in charge... Alan. We got bigger problems here. Doug could be in the hospital,\Nhe could be hurt. [CRANE BEEPING] - Let's worry about the car later.\N- Uh, guys? Check it out. MAN:\NAll right, grab it from the other side. Is that the mattress from Doug's room? PHIL:\NWhat the fuck? Hey, man, what's going on here? Some asshole threw his bed\Nout the window last night. - No shit.\N- Yeah. Some guys just can't handle Vegas. Ha-ha. Oh, God. It's gonna be okay, Stu. How the hell did we manage that? - Here's your car, officers.\N- Oh, God. All right, everybody act cool.\NAll right, don't say a word. Come on, let's just get in and go.\NCome on. - Stu, you got a five?\NSTU: No. PHIL: I'll hit you on the way back.\NVALET: Thank you, sir. Oh, my God.\NOh, my God. [BABY CRYING] You just nailed the baby. ALAN:\NAre my glasses okay? Your glasses are fine, dick. [CAR HORN HONKING] STU:\NThis is so illegal. Can't you see the fun part in anything? Yeah, we're stuck in traffic\Nin a stolen police car... ...with a missing child\Nin the back seat. Which part of this is fun? - I think the cop-car part's pretty cool.\N- Thank you, Alan. It is cool. Doug would love it. Come on. [SIREN WAILING] - Check this out.\NSTU: Oh, no. No, Phil. No, Phil. Don't do this! PHIL: Take it easy.\N- Just try to call more attention to us. PHIL [OVER PA]: Attention.\N- Sorry. PHIL:\NAttention, please. Move out of the way. I repeat, please disperse.

They found a large amount of Ruphylin\Nin your system. Ruphylin. Roofies.\NCommonly known as the date-rape drug. What, so, what are you saying,\NI was raped last night? Actually... I don't think so.\NBut someone did slip you the drug. I'm not surprised\Nyou don't remember anything. [CHUCKLES] Doc, none of us can remember anything\Nfrom last night. Remember? Yeah. How could someone\Nhave drugged all of us? VALSH:\NI wouldn't worry about it. The stuff's out of your system.\NYou're gonna be fine. Wait, wait, wait. Please, doctor.\NIs there anything else? Like, something we may have been talking\Nabout, or some place we were going? Actually, there was something. You guys kept talking about some wedding\Nlast night. Yeah. No shit. Our buddy Doug's\Ngetting married tomorrow. - You know what? I want the 100 back.\N- No, no. Easy. You kept talking about some wedding\Nyou just came from. At the, uh, Best Little Chapel.

This guy is the craziest, wildest bastard\NI ever met in my life, man. - This guy?\N- This guy is out of his mind. What's going on,\Nyou fucking crazy motherfucker? I thought he was gonna eat my dick. What happened?\NNo love for Eddie? You don't hug me? No, no. It's not that, Eddie. Uh, it's just that we're having a hard time\Nremembering what happened here last night. Yeah, was there a wedding here?\NDo you do weddings here? [LAUGHS] You are cracking my balls, man. I love these guys.\NZolea, what are you doing? Bring my friends some tea,\Nsome baklava, huh? Come on. Unbelievable, man. Look at this chick.\NBeautiful ass, no fucking brain. But this is Vegas. You want intimacy,\Nforget it. You're gonna get sex. That's it here, man.\NNo problem for me, though. You want chicks?\NI can get you beautiful chicks... ...from the Eastern Bloc. No questions. Clean, tight.\NThe tits like that, the nipple like that. Obviously we were here.\NWe're looking for our friend Doug. - Do you remember?\N- Yeah, the small guy. Like a monkey. - Yeah.\N- You saw him? Of course. Is there anything you can tell us about\Nwhat may have happened last night? You don't remember nothing? [STU GROANS] - Congratulations, Stu, you got married.\N- This... This can't be happening. - Oh, God.\NALAN: Look at that. [STU GROANING] I'll tell you one thing,\Nyou look seriously happy here, man. STU:\NThat's it. My life is over. Stu, it's okay. Look, shit happens. Come on. Melissa's not gonna know\Nanything about this. - This never happened. I'll take care of it.\N- Come on. Put it here. Hey, what's all that? The High Roller package.\NIt's what you ordered. I have coffee mugs. - What?\NEDDIE: You have baseball caps, huh? And fancy calendars, all with pictures\Nof Stu and Jade. PHIL:\NHer name's Jade? Yeah, and she's beautiful, man.\NClean, very tight. Tits like that. - But that's because she had a baby.\NPHIL: That explains the baby. - Oh, Carlos. Carlos.\N- Great. All right. Uh, here's the deal.\NWe made a mistake last night. We need this marriage annulled.\NYou do annulments? Of course I do. It breaks my heart\Nand gonna make me sad... ...but it's no problem.\NGood price for you. I can't do it with just him, though.\NI need the chick. I need both parties. Oh, not a problem.

EDDIE:\NAnd get the baklava, please. - Hey, Phil, what about my dad's car?\N- I'm sure Doug has it. We'll get it back. Then I vote we torch the cop car\Nand all this shit with it. - Torch it? Who are you?\N- I don't know, Phil. Apparently I'm a guy who marries\Ncomplete strangers. This whole situation is completely fucked. - These mugs. This hat. This car.\N- Hey! It's all evidence\Nof a night that never happened. That is why we're torching all of it. Whoa, I'm a schoolteacher,\NI got a family, okay? I'm all for secrecy,\Nbut I'm not gonna torch a cop car. - Fine. I'll do it.\N- Can I help? - Yeah, thanks.\N- And how exactly are you gonna do that? Easy. You just pour kerosene over a ferret,\Nlight it on both ends, put it in. They're attracted to the gas lines. - What? A ferret?\N- Yeah. Yeah. Or a tamed raccoon,\Nbut it's a lot of trouble. ALAN: If you wanna...\N- Does it matter if it's tamed? Yeah, because if it's untamed,\Nit won't take the kerosene as well. [CELL PHONE RINGING] PHIL: Is it Doug?\N- I don't have it. PHIL:\NIt's Doug, it's Doug. Uh, it's Melissa. - Don't answer.\N- I have to. She's called twice already! - Can I ride shotgun?\NPHIL: Don't touch me. Hey, sweetheart, how are you? There you are.\NThis is the third time I'm trying you. I know. The reception up here's crazy. I think it's all the sequoia trees,\Nblock the signal. Ugh, I hate that.\NSo how was it last night? Ah, it was really fun, actually.\NIt was quiet, but it was a good time. MELISSA:\NThat sounds nice. - I'm learning all kinds of vino factoids.\N- Hi. [BABBLES] It'd be so cool if I could breast-feed,\Nyou know? STU:\NWell, listen... ...we're about to go for a tractor ride.\NPHIL: What the fuck? STU: I should get going. So pretty.\NMELISSA: A tractor ride? [BASEBALL BAT THUDS] - Go, out of the car!\N- What was that? They started up the tractor.\NI think it backfired. - Where the hell is he?\NPHIL: Hey, easy, easy. I think we're looking for\Nthe same guy, okay? Hey! What the hell, man? [CRYING] MELISSA: What the fuck, Stu?\NIs that a baby? Why would there be a baby?\NWe're at a winery. That's a goat. - Where is he?\N- I don't know! What are you talking about? Sir, can you please start the tractor\Nso we can get out of here? I'm trying to, but we're fucking blocked. Oh, my God!\NWhat the hell is happening, Stu? - Hey! There's a baby on board!\N- Someone just said "baby." - Get out of the car!\N- It's a baby goat. Why you making trouble\Nfor my business, man? - Go away from here.\N- Get out of the car! - Phil, he's got a gun!\N- No shit he's got a gun! - I gotta call you back. Bye.\N- Come on. PHIL: Fuck!

[SIGHS] [PANTING] [CELL PHONE RINGING] Why don't you just let that\Ngo to voicemail? Ha-ha-ha. That's a fake laugh, by the way. It's got, uh, Ted Danson and Magnum\NP.I. And that Jewish actor. Shut up, Alan. - What room was it again?\N- It's 825. WOMAN:\NI know, I did. I already checked with her. I found him, I'll call you back.\NThank God, he's with his father. I was freaking out. I missed you, sweetie. And I miss you. [JADE MOANING] No. - What the hell happened to you guys?\N- Actually, we were hoping you could tell us. What do you mean? I got up this morning,\NI went to get coffee... ...and I came back and you were gone. - Why are you being so quiet?\N- I'm not being quiet. Ha, ha. You're so cute. Yeah, I gotta feed Tyler.\NCome inside, you guys. Did you hear that? Baby's name is Tyler. Yeah. I thought he looked\Nmore like a Carlos too, bud. Okay, what's up?\NYou guys are acting weird. - Look, it's Jade, right?\N- Very funny, Phil. Right, Jade, uh, ahem,\Nyou remember our friend, Doug. Are you kidding? He was the best man. Exactly. Well, we can't find him,\Nand we're getting worried. JADE:\NOh, my God, that is so Doug. Ha, ha. Oh. [CRYING] Oh, sweetie, I'm...\NI'm gonna go clean him off. It's all right, Daddy didn't mean it. Oh, my God. What the fuck, man,\Nyou gotta hold it together. - Holy shit.\N- She is super hot. - You should be proud of yourself.\N- She's wearing my grandmother's ring! - What?\N- The ring I'm gonna give to Melissa. You remember,\Nmy grandmother's Holocaust ring? - Fuck. Okay.\N- She's wearing it. I didn't know they gave out rings\Nat the Holocaust. - He's okay.\NPHIL: Oh, good. JADE: He was just hungry, he's fine.\N- Oh, good. About last night, uh, ahem, do you\Nremember the last time you saw Doug? - Uh, I haven't seen him since the wedding.\N- The wedding. Okay. Great. And, uh, we can't re...\NWhat time was that at? Well, it was, um... [CLEARING THROAT] I guess it was around 1, because I had\Nto go back to work and finish my shift. And then when I got out I headed over\Nto the hotel with Tyler. And was Doug there then? I didn't see Doug because you guys\Nwere passed out. The room was a wreck. - So I just curled up next to Stu.\NPHIL: Uh-huh. - Rowr.\N- Oh. I got a question.\NUm, you said when your shift ended. Does that mean you're a nurse?\NOr a blackjack dealer? - You know this. I'm a stripper.\N- Mm-hm. Well, technically I'm an escort, but\Nstripping's a great way to meet the clients. - Smart.\N- Savvy. But that's all in the past,\Nnow that I married a doctor. I'm just a dentist. - Las Vegas Police! Freeze!\N- Okay. [TYLER CRYING] Shut that baby up! Shut that baby up! STU: Oh, God!\NPHIL: Okay, okay, okay. After we take the mug shots,\Nwe bring them down here... ...where they wait to be interviewed\Nby the arresting officers.

I'm just wondering\Nwhy you're calling me. Um... We made a deal,\Nno talking to girlfriends or wives. So we're all calling each other's. TRACY:\NOkay. What's up? Uh, you are not gonna believe this.\NWe got comped an extra night at the hotel. You did? Yeah. The suite is... It's ridiculous.\NIt's out of control. There's, like, room service and a butler.\NI mean, just the works. We're thinking of spending the night... ...and we're gonna come back\Nin the morning. You wanna stay an extra night?\NBut the wedding's tomorrow. That's why we're gonna get up early,\Nand we'll be back in plenty of time. Okay. Are you sure that's a good idea? Wenneck, Price, Garner.

Yeah, it's over at impound right now.\NWe picked it up at 5 a.m. This morning... ...parked in the middle\Nof Las Vegas Boulevard. PHIL: In the middle. That's weird.\N- Yeah, that is weird. There was also a note. It says, uh, "Couldn't find a meter,\Nbut here's 4 bucks." The bad news is... ...we can't get you in front of a judge\Nuntil Monday morning. Oh, no, uh, officer, that's just impossible. No, we need to be in L.A. Tomorrow\Nfor a wedding. - You stole a police car.\N- We didn't steal anything. Um, we found it. Yeah, if anything, we deserve a reward\Nor something, like a trophy. - I see assholes like you every day.\N- Every fucking day. "Let's go to Vegas,\Nwe'll all get drunk and laid! - Yeah. Whoo! Woo-hoo.\N- Woo-hoo. Let's steal a cop car,\Nbecause it'd be really fucking funny." Think you gonna get away with it?\NNot up in here. - Not up in here!\N- Oh. Uh... Sir... ...if I may, um... ...l'm assuming that that squad car\Nbelongs to one of you. - Yeah.\NPHIL: Yeah. Look, I'm not a cop. I'm no hero. I'm a schoolteacher. But if one of my kids went missing\Non a field trip... ...that would look really bad on me. - What are you getting at?\N- Yeah, Phil, what are you getting at? No one wants to look bad.\NWe gotta get to a wedding... ...and you guys don't need people\Ntalking about... ...how some obnoxious tourists borrowed\Nyour squad car last night. But look, the point is,\NI think we can work out a deal. Discreetly of course, ma'am. What do you say? [LAUGHS] FRANKLIN:\NLet me ask you a question: Do, uh, any of you gentlemen\Nhave a heart condition or anything like that? Uh, no. Okay, kids,\Nyou're in for a real treat today. These gentlemen have kindly volunteered\Nto demonstrate... ...how a stun gun is used\Nto subdue a suspect. KIDS:\NOoh! - That's right.\N- Wait a sec. What? Now, there's two ways to use a stun gun.\NUp close and personal. [SCREAMS] [LAUGHING] - What the fuck?\N- Or you can shoot it from a distance. Do I have any volunteers?

I'm just worried. What if something happened to Doug?\NSomething bad. Come on, you can't think like that. I mean, what if he's dead? I can't afford to lose anybody\Nclose to me again. It hurts too much. - I was so upset when my grandpa died.\N- Oh, I'm s... How'd he die? - World War II.\N- Died in battle? No, he was skiing in Vermont.\NIt was just during World War II. Alan... ...Doug is fine.\N- Well, why hasn't he called? I don't know,\Nbut we're gonna figure it out. I'll tell you another thing,\N6-1 odds our car is beat to shit. Stu, not now.

Last night on the roof,\Nbefore we went out... ...I slipped something\Nin our Jägermeister. - What?\N- I'm sorry, I fudged up, guys. - You drugged us?\N- No, I didn't drug you. I was told it was ecstasy. Well, who told you it was ecstasy? The guy I bought it from\Nat the liquor store. Why would you give us ecstasy? I wanted everybody to have a good time\Nand I knew you guys wouldn't take it. It was just one hit each.\NI used to do three hits a night. But it wasn't ecstasy, Alan,\Nit was roofies! ALAN:\NYou think I knew that, Stu? The guy I bought it from\Nseemed like a real straight shooter. You mean the drug dealer at the liquor store\Nwasn't a good guy? Let's just calm down. You fucking calm down! He drugged us.\NI lost a tooth. I married a whore. - How dare you! She's a nice lady.\N- You are such a fucking moron. - Your language is offensive.\NSTU: Fuck you! All right,\Nlet's just take a deep breath, okay? Seriously, this is a good thing. At least it's not some stranger who\Ndrugged us for God knows what reason. Yeah, you're right, Phil,\Nit's totally a good thing. We're so much better off now. Here's something\NI would like to remind you two of: Our best friend Doug is probably\Nfacedown in a ditch right now... ...with a meth-head butt-fucking\Nhis corpse. - That's highly unlikely.\N- It's true. Does not help.\NAll right, let's get our shit together, guys. Let's go back to the hotel,\Nand I'm gonna make a couple calls. Maybe Doug's back there.\NMaybe he's asleep. Come on. Let's go. - Stu? Little help?\NSTU: Shut up. ALAN: Ow.\N- Oh, God. Oh, God, are you okay? ALAN: Yeah, I'm fine.\N- Alan, I'm sorry. Wait, guys. Guys. What about the tiger?\NWhat if he got out? Oh, fuck. I keep forgetting\Nabout the goddamn tiger. How the fuck did he get in there? - I don't know, because I don't remember.\N- Shh. Stu. Stu, keep it down. Because one of the, uh, side effects of, uh,\Nroofies is memory loss. You are literally too stupid to insult. - Thank you.\N- Hey. [PHIL COLLINS' "IN THE AIR TONIGHT"\NPLAYING OVER SPEAKERS] Hey, come on. Did we leave the music on? Hey. Shh. Don't make any sudden movements. - Unh.

Mr. Tyson would like to know\Nwhy is his tiger in your bathroom. Hold on,\Nthat was completely unnecessary. I'm a huge fan.\NWhen you knocked out Holmes, that was... Explain. All right, look, we were drugged last night.\NWe have no memory of what happened. STU:\NIt's true. We got in all kinds of trouble last night\Nand now we can't find our friend. If you wanna kill us,\Ngo ahead because I don't care anymore. - What are you talking about?\N- I don't care. Why the fuck\Nwould you wanna steal his tiger? We tend to do dumb shit\Nwhen we're fucked up. - I don't believe these guys, man.\N- Wait, how did you guys find us? One of you dropped your jacket.\NFound it in the tigers' cage this morning. That's Doug's. Yeah, Doug.\NHis wallet and his room key is in there. - No, that's our missing friend.\NLEONARD: I don't give a fuck. - Did you guys see him?\NMIKE: I was fast asleep. Because if he was up, this\Nwouldn't have gone down so smoothly. Maybe one of the tigers\Nate his ass like Omar. Respect. Wha... What happened to Omar? Oh, don't worry about Omar,\Nhe's not with us no more. Okay, I know this is asking a lot... ...but do you think we could\Ngo to your house and look around... ...see if there's any clues? Absolutely. How else you think\Nwe're gonna get the tiger back anyway? - Come on, champ.\N- I'm sorry? We're not gonna put it in the Bentley.\NYou brought it here, you bring it back. What you think, about 40 minutes? Don't make me come back for him. - That was Mike Tyson.\N- Yeah, no shit that was Mike Tyson. I'm just saying, he's still got it. PHIL:\NAlan. Bud, are you okay? STU: Oh, my God.\N- Shit! Fuck, where'd he get him? Hey. STU:\NThis does not seem fair. PHIL: It's Rock, Paper, Scissors.\NThere's nothing more fair. - Alan should do it.\N- Alan took a punch from Mike Tyson. Come on. For Doug. Why are you peppering the steak?\NYou don't know if tigers like pepper. Tigers love pepper. They hate cinnamon. Phil, just do it. You should do it. I would, but you lost.\NIt wouldn't be right. Okay, I jammed five roofies in there. Just go in there and throw it in to him. Fine. Make sure he eats the whole thing. Fuck. Oh, fuck. Hey, kitty. Hey, sweetie, it's okay.\NI got a little snack for you. Real important that you eat this, okay? Yeah, just have a little... [TIGER ROARING] [SCREAMS] Shit! [PANTING] What do we do now? We wait.

Okay, yeah. Whew. Daddy's gonna kill me. - That's it.\NPHIL: That's good. Keep it straight. [DOORBELL RINGS] - You're late.\N- Whatever, man. We had to push it the last mile. Come on in. Mike's got something\Nhe wants to show you. [TIGER GROANING] That thing's out of control, man.\NSeriously, you gotta put it down. When we got back,\Nwe took a look at the security cameras. Great. PHIL [ON VIDEO]: This is how you walk.\NThis is how you walk. - Oh, it's Doug.\N- Oh, thank God he's alive. That's our buddy.\NThat's who we've been missing. We're all best friends. Why don't you just pay attention?\NI don't have all night. Yeah, of course. Of course. STU: What are you doing?\NALAN: Hey, guys. Check it out. Watch this. That's me, I'm on TV.\NI've never been on TV before. DOUG:\NWhat are you doing, man? Really? Really, Alan? DOUG:\NYou got a fire hose, man? Yeah, I was, uh... [DOUG LAUGHING ON VIDEO] STU:\NYou're gonna overflow the pool, man. - Maybe... Should I wait outside?\N- I think that's a good idea, Alan. ALAN:\NYeah. Don't touch anything out there, either. You know what? He's not our good fr...\NWe don't know him that well. PHIL:\NCome on. Come on, come on. By the way,\Nwhere you get that cop car from? We, uh, stole it from\Nthese dumb-ass cops. Nice. [LAUGHING] High five that one. Yeah, that's nice. PHIL:\NYou know, I just have to say... ...I have never seen a more beautiful,\Nelegant, just regal creature. PHIL: Check it out. Stu. Stu.\NFuck this tiger. STU: Oh, my God. That's awful.\NMIKE: Oh, man. [STU LAUGHING ON VIDEO] PHIL [OVER TV]: Oh, shit.\N- Who does shit like that, man? Someone who has a lot of issues, obviously.\NI'm a sick man. DOUG:\NOh, my God. That's all we got. This was hugely helpful. Really. Because now we know\Nthat our buddy Doug... ...was with us at 3:30, totally alive. Thanks again, champ. And, uh, again,\Nwe are so sorry we stole your tiger. Don't worry about it, man. Like you said, we all do dumb shit\Nwhen we're fucked up. [LAUGHING] - I told you he'd get it.\N- I did say that. You know, everyone says\NMike Tyson is such a badass... ...but I think he's kind of a sweetheart. I think he's mean. All right. I think it's officially time\Nwe call Tracy. Hallelujah. Finally, Phil says something\Nthat makes sense. We don't have much of a choice.\NAnd maybe she's heard from Doug. That's what I been saying this whole time. We just need to be completely honest.\NWe need to tell her everything. We don't have to tell her everything.\NWe can leave out the stuff... ...about me marrying a hooker. Just stay focused on Doug. - What am I gonna tell my dad?\N- Alan, relax. It's just the inside. Come on. I got a guy in L.A.\NWho's great with interiors.

Okay?\NAnd you steal from wrong guy. Wait a second, wait a second.\NWe stole from you? Okay, you know what? We don't remember anything\Nthat happened last night... ...so help us out a little here. Well, apparently you guys met\Nat a craps table late last night. You were on a heater,\Nand he played your hot streak. - He ended up winning just under 80 grand.\N- No shit? Eighty grand is nice. Okay, that's good. He put the chips in his purse,\Nand then you guys took off with it. That doesn't sound like us. Mine had $80,000 inside.\NAnd this one? Nothing. Hey, there are Skittles in there. Ow! Oh, not again. [LAUGHING] Don't let the beard fool you.\NHe's a child. It's funny because he's fat. Now, look, this was obviously\Na very simple misunderstanding.

Yeah, you said he was your lucky charm,\Nand you want to take him home with you. [PHIL AND STU LAUGH] - Lucky charm.\N- Oh, it's just funny. [LAUGHING] Fuck you.

We were shooting craps.\NYou don't remember? No. No, we don't remember. Because some dick drug dealer sold him\NRuphylin and told him it was ecstasy. Ruphylin. There you go with that word.\NRuphylin. What the hell is a Ruphylin? Wow, you are\Nthe world's shittiest drug dealer. Ruphylin, for your information,\Nis the date-rape drug. You sold Alan roofies. Oh, shit. I must have mixed up the bags.\NMy fault, Alan. Damn, Marshall gonna be pissed off at me\Non that one. - Whatever.\N- It's funny, because just the other day... ...me and my boy, we was wondering\Nwhy they even call them roofies. - You know what I'm talking about?\N- No. Don't know. Why not floories, right?\NBecause when you take them... ...you're more likely\Nto end up on the floor than the roof. What about groundies?\NThat's a good new name for them. Or, how about rapies? - Wait, what did you just say?\N- Rapies. - Not you. Doug, what did you say before?\N- I said groundies. No, before that. You said, "You're more likely to wind up\Non the floor than..." - Phil.\N- Listen, Trace, I'm really sorry. L... [GRUNTING] TRACY [OVER PHONE]: Phil? Hello?\N- Tracy, it's Stu. Stu. Talk to me.

What's going on?\N- Doug was trying to signal someone. - Holy shit.\NSTU: Yes. - Wait. How did you figure that out?\N- Doug made me realize it. - Doug?\N- Uh, not our Doug. Black Doug. - Hey, hey, easy with that shit. Come on.\N- Sorry. Can someone tell me\Nwhere white Doug is? - He's on the roof, Alan.\N- Yes. He's on the roof. We must have taken him\Nup there as a prank... ...so he'd wake up on the roof.\N- Like that time in summer camp. We moved his sleeping bag\Nout in the jetty at the lake? Ha, ha, ha. Which was hilarious. It's not so funny now, though,\Nbecause we forgot where we put him. You guys are retarded, you know that? - Holy shit.

It's not your fault, Doug.\N- Don't touch me. Shut up. All of you, shut up. Just get me home. Mm-hm. Just get me home. STU:\NWhat about the one after that? You cannot be serious. Oh, goddamn it. - What?\N- Every flight to L.A. Is booked. - What about Burbank?\N- Sold out. Oh, fuck!
