World of Warcraft - Outland PVP (EU) - Torporr (name) Well, I mean... ...isn't everything autobiographical? I mean, we all see the world\Nthrough our own tiny keyhole, right? I mean, I always think\Nof Thomas Wolfe. Have you ever seen that little\None-page "Note to Reader"... <i>...in the front\Nof Look Homeward, Angel?</i> Anyway, he says that we are the sum\Nof all the moments of our lives... ...and anybody who sits down to write\Nwill use the clay of their own life... ...that you can't avoid that. So when I look at my own life,\NI have to admit, right, that I... I've never been around a bunch of guns\Nor violence, you know, not really. No political intrigue\Nor a helicopter crash, right? But my life, from my own point of view,\Nhas been full of drama, right? And so I thought,\Nif I could write a book... ...that could capture what it's like\Nto really meet somebody... One of the most exciting things\Nthat's happened to me... ...is to meet somebody,\Nmake that connection. And if I could make that valuable,\Nyou know, to capture that... ...that would be the attempt, or... Did I answer your question? I'll try to be more specific. Was there ever a French young woman\Non a train you met... ...and spent an evening with? See, to me, that... I mean... ...that's not important, you know?\N- So that's a yes? All right, since I'm in France and this\Nis the last stop of my book tour, yes. Thank you. Mr. Wallace, the book ends\Non an ambiguous note. We don't know. Do you think they get back together\Nin six months... ...like they promise each other? Like they promised? I think how you answer that,\Nyou know, is... It's a good test, right,\Nif you're a romantic or a cynic. Right? I mean, you think\Nthey get back together, right? - You don't, for sure.\N- No. And you hope they do,\Nbut you're not sure. - That's why you're asking the question.\N- Do you think they get back together? I mean, did you in real life? Did I in real...? Look, in the words\Nof my grandfather, okay: "To answer that would take\Nthe piss out of the whole thing. " We just have the time\Nfor one last question. What is your next book? I don't know, man. I don't know. I've been...\NI've been thinking about this... Well, I always kind of wanted\Nto write a book... ...that all took place\Nwithin the space of a pop song. Like three or four minutes long,\Nthe whole thing. The story, the idea,\Nis that there's this guy, right... ...and he's totally depressed. His great dream was to be a lover,\Nan adventurer, you know... ...riding motorcycles\Nthrough South America. And instead he's sitting\Nat a marble table eating lobster. He's got a good job and\Na beautiful wife, right, but that... Everything that he needs.\NBut that doesn't matter... ...because what he wants\Nis to fight for meaning. You know? Happiness\Nis in the doing, right? Not in the getting what you want. So he's sitting there,\Nand just that second... ...his little 5-year-old daughter\Nhops up on the table. And he knows that she should\Nget down, because she could get hurt. But she's dancing to this pop song\Nin a summer dress. And he looks down... ...and all of a sudden, he's 6. And his high-school sweetheart\Nis dropping him off at home. And they just lost their virginity,\Nand she loves him... ...and the same song is playing\Non the car radio. And she climbs up and starts dancing\Non the roof of the car. And now he's worried about her. And she's beautiful, with a facial\Nexpression just like his daughter's. In fact, maybe that's why\Nhe even likes her. You see, he knows he's not\Nremembering this dance... ...he's there. He's there,\Nin both moments, simultaneously. And just for an instant,\Nall his life is just folding in on itself. And it's obvious to him\Nthat time is a lie. That it's all happening all the time... ...and inside every moment\Nis another moment... ...all happening simultaneously. Anyway, that's kind of the idea.\NAnyway. Our author has to be going\Nto the airport soon... ...so thank you all very much\Nfor coming over this afternoon. And a special thanks to Mr. Wallace\Nfor being with us. Thank you. Thank you. We hope to see you here again\Nwith your next book. Thank you all. How much longer\Nbefore I have to go to the airport? Oh, you should leave at 7:30... - Seven-thirty at the very latest.\N- Okay. - Hi.\N- Hello. - How are you?\N- Good, and you? I'm good, yeah, I'm great. I'm... Do you wanna, maybe,\Nget a cup of coffee? Didn't he just say\Nyou have a plane to catch? Yeah. But, I mean, I have a little time. - Okay.\N- Yeah? All right, well, let me... I'll meet you outside. Okay. Excuse me. I'm just gonna go\Nget a cup of coffee. - I'll be back at 7: 5.\N- Did you sign all these? - Yeah, I sure did.\N- Get your driver Philippe's card... ...so you can call his cell\Nif you're running late. We'll put your bags in the car\Nso you're not late. - All right, thanks for everything.\N- Thank you. Which one's Philippe? - I can't believe you're here.\N- I live here in Paris. Are you sure you don't have to stay?\NYou're not supposed to talk more? They're sick of me.\NI spent the night here. - You did?\N- Yeah, they got a loft upstairs. - How are you? This is so weird.\N- I'm fine. - It's good to see you.\N- It's good to see you. - So you want to go to a café?\N- Yeah. Okay. There's one a little further\Nthat I like. I thought I was gonna totally lose it\Nin there when I first saw you. How did you know\NI was gonna be here? It's my favorite bookstore in Paris.\NYou can sit down for hours and read. I love it. There's fleas,\Nbut, you know... I know. I think a cat slept\Non my head last night. I saw your picture on the calendar\Nabout a month ago... ...and that you were going\Nto be here. It's funny, because I read an article\Non your book... ...and it sounded vaguely familiar.\N- Vaguely? Yeah. But I didn't put it all together\Nuntil I saw your photo. So... Did you have a chance to read it? Yes, I... I was really, really surprised,\Nas you can imagine. I mean, I had to read it twice, actually. - Yeah?\N- Yeah. No, I liked it. It's very romantic. I usually don't like that,\Nbut it's really well-written. - It's well-written. Congratulations.\N- All right. Thank you. - Wait.\N- What? Before we go anywhere,\NI have to ask you... Sure. What? Did you show up in Vienna\Nthat December? - Did you?\N- No, I couldn't. But did you? - I need to know. It's important to me.\N- Why, if you didn't? Well, did you? No. Thank God you didn't. - Oh, my God.\N- Thank God you didn't. Thank God I didn't and you didn't.\NIf one of us had showed up alone... ...that would have sucked.\N- I was so concerned. I felt horrible about not being there,\Nbut I couldn't. My grandma died... ...and she was buried that day,\NDecember 6th. - The one in Budapest?\N- Yes. You remember that? - I remember everything.\N- Of course, it was in your book. But anyway, I was about to\Nfly to Vienna, you know... ...and we heard the news about her,\Nand of course I had to go to the funeral. Yeah, I'm sorry to hear that. I know. But you weren't there anyway. Wait. Why weren't you there? I would have been there\Nif I could have. I made plans... You better have a good reason. What? Oh, no. No, you were there, weren't you? Oh, no, that's terrible! I'm laughing, but I don't mean it. Did you hate me?\NYou must've hated me. - Have you been hating me all this time?\N- No. - Yes, you have.\N- No. But you can't hate me now, right? - I mean, my grandma...\N- I don't hate you. It's no big deal. I flew all the way over there,\Nyou blew the thing off. My life's been a big nosedive since,\Nbut it's not a problem. - No, I'm kidding.\N- Don't say that. I can't believe it. You must have been so angry\Nwith me. I'm so sorry. I wanted to be there,\Nmore than anything in the world. - Honestly, I swear...\N- You can't be angry, my grandmother... I know. I honestly thought that something\Nlike that might have happened. I was definitely bummed, but... Mostly I was mad we hadn't exchanged\Nany phone numbers or any information. That was so stupid.\NNo way to get in touch. - Nothing to go on.\N- I didn't know your last name. Remember, we were both afraid\Nif we started writing and calling... ...that it would slowly fade out.\N- It definitely wasn't a slow fade. No, it sure wasn't. We wanted to pick up\Nwhere we left off. Which would have been fine\Nif it had worked. Oh, well. So... - How long were you in Vienna, then?\N- Just a couple days. Did you meet another girl? Yeah, her name was Gretchen\Nand she was amazing. The book's really a composite\Nof the two of you. No, I'm kidding. You wouldn't believe...\NI even went back to the train station. I put up signs of my number\Nin the hotel in case you'd been delayed. - I was a total dork.\N- Let's go this way. Did you get any calls? Just a couple hookers\Nlooking for a gig. No, it was awful, I mean,\Nwhat do you want me to say? It's so sad. I'm so sorry. I walked around for a couple days.\NEventually, I flew home. I owed my dad 2000 bucks... ...who had warned me\Nabout French chicks. What did he tell you\Nabout French women? Nothing. He's never met\Nany French women. He's never been\Neast of the Mississippi. Why didn't you put, "Six months later,\Nthe French bitch didn't show up"? No, but I did, I did. - You did?\N- Yeah. No. I made it more hopeful. I wrote this fictional version\Nwhere you do show up. - Oh, what happens?\N- Well... What? We make love for about 0 days straight,\Nthat's one part of it. - Interesting. So the French slut, right?\N- Yeah, exactly. It's just then they get\Nto know each other better... ...and realize they don't\Nget along at all. - I like that. It's more real.\N- My editor didn't think that way. Everyone wants to believe in love.\NIt sells. Yeah, exactly, so... So things are going well for you,\Nright? I mean... - Your book is a bestseller in the U. S.\N- It's a tiny bestseller. - Oh, come on.\N- All right. Officially, yes. <i>Most people haven't read Moby Dick.\NWhy should they read my book?</i> <i>I haven't read Moby Dick\Nand I liked your book.</i> - Thanks.\N- Even though... ...I thought you idealized\Nthe night of it. Come on, it's fiction, right? - I'm supposed to...\N- I know, I know. I know. I thought there were times\Nwhere you made me... Well, I mean, her, right?\NNo, me. Okay, whatever. - A little bit neurotic.\N- You are a bit like that, aren't you? - You think I'm neurotic?\N- No, no, no. Come on, I'm kidding. Where did I do that? I didn't do that. Oh, maybe it's just me, you know... Reading something, knowing\Nthe character is based on you... ...it's both flattering and disturbing\Nat the same time. How is it disturbing? I don't know. Just being part\Nof someone else's memory. Seeing myself through your eyes. How long did it take you to write it? Three or four years, on and off. Wow, that's a really long time\Nto be writing about one night. Yeah, I know. Tell me about it. I always assumed\Nyou had forgotten me. No, I had a pretty clear picture\Nof you in my mind. - I have to tell you something. I just...\N- What? I've wanted to talk to you for so long\Nthat now... It's just surreal, you know? I feel like everything should be... How long do we have?\NTwenty minutes and 30 seconds? We got more than that.\NI wanna know about you. Tell me, what are you doing?\NWhat are you up to? Where to start? I work for Green Cross.\NIt's an environmental organization. What are they all about? We basically work on different\Nenvironment issues... ...from clean water to\Ndisarmament of chemical weapons. International laws that deal\Nwith the environment. - What do you do for them?\N- We're going this way. Different things. Like, last year I was in India for a while,\Nworking on a water-treatment plant. Well, the cotton industry there\Nis a major source of pollution, so... I mean, it sounds like you're actually\Ndoing something. Most people, myself included,\Njust sit around and bitch. You know, how America's consuming\Nall the world's resources, SUVs suck... ...global warming is real... I'm relieved to hear you're not one\Nof those "freedom fries" Americans. Hey, you know...\NBut how'd you get into that? I came out of political science,\Nhoping to work for the government. - And I did for a little while. Terrible.\N- Not good? Yeah, no. Anyway, I got really tired...\NLet's go this way. Having this endless conversation\Nwith friends... ...about how the world\Nwas falling to pieces. So I decided what I really\Nwanted to do was... ...to find things that could be fixed\Nand try to fix them, you know? You know, I always thought you'd be\Ndoing something cool like that. I did. Thanks. I just feel really, really lucky\Nto be doing a job I like, you know? Yeah. I actually alternate in between thinking\Neverything is irrevocably screwed up... ...and things might be\Ngetting better in ways. Better? How could you\Npossibly say that? Well, I just mean, you know, like... I know it sounds weird, but there are\Nthings to be optimistic about. Okay... I know your book is selling,\Nwhich is great, I'm very happy for you. But let me break the news to you:\NThe world is a mess right now. From a Western view,\Nthings are getting a bit better. We're moving industry to developing\Nnations where we can get cheap labor... ...free of any environmental laws.\NThe weapon industry is booming. Five million people die a year\Nfrom preventable water disease. How is the world getting better?\NI'm not angry, I'm not angry. But come on, I want to know.\NI'm interested. I realize that there are a lot\Nof serious problems in the world. - Okay. Thank you.\N- I mean, I don't even have... ...one publisher in the Asian market.\N- Okay. All right. - Say stop.\N- What? Stop. Look, all I'm saying is there's more\Nawareness. People are gonna fight back. The world might be getting better\Nbecause people like you... ...are educated and speaking out. Even the very notion of conservation,\Nenvironmental issues... ...weren't in the vocabulary\Ntill fairly recently. And they're becoming the norm and\Neventually might be what's expected. I agree with what you're saying,\Nbut at the same time it's dangerous. An imperialist country can use\Nthat kind of thinking... ...to justify their economic greed. Is there any particular imperialist country\Nyou have in mind, there, Frenchie? - No, not really.\N- No? - So you wanna sit over there?\N- Yeah, this is perfect. Oh, wow. Maybe what I'm saying is... ...the world might be evolving\Nthe way a person evolves. Like, I mean, me, for example.\NAm I getting worse? Am I improving? I don't know.\NWhen I was younger, I was healthier... ...but I was wracked with insecurity,\Nyou know? Now I'm older and my problems\Nare deeper... ...but I'm more equipped\Nto handle them. So, what are your problems? Right now I don't have any.\NI don't, you know? I'm just... ...damn happy to be here. Me too. So how long have you been in Paris? I got in last night.\NI've done 0 cities in 2 days. I'm wrecked. I'm so glad it's over,\Nyou know? I'm tired of being a huckster. - Hi.\N- Hello. What do you want? A cup of coffee. God, I love this café. I wish they had\Nplaces like this in the U. S. Yeah, I missed cafés\Nwhen I was living over there. I mean, I find a few places\NI really liked, but there was... - You were living in the U. S.?\N- Yes, from '96 to '99. I was studying at NYU. Oh, God, don't tell me that, Celine. - What?\N- No, it's just... - Nothing, I mean, I...\N- What? I've been living in New York since '98.\NWe were there at the same time. - In New York?\N- Yeah. That's weird. It actually crossed my mind\Na few times that I might run into you... ...but the odds are so slim, right? So... I didn't even know\Nwhat city you were in. - Weren't you somewhere in Texas?\N- Yeah, yeah, definitely. I just... I was for a long time. I just,\Nyou know, wanted to try New York. What brought you back here? I had finished my master's, for one... ...and no visa, no more visa. And I was starting to get paranoid.\NAll the violence in the medias: Gang violence, murders,\Nespecially serial killers... But the final straw was... ...one night I heard some noise\Non my fire escape... ...so I called 9,\Nand the cops came eventually. - Like three hours later.\N- Yeah, after I had been raped and killed. No, but it was a man\Nand a woman officer. I was explaining what I had heard... ...when the woman had\Nto go move the police car. I was left alone with the male cop. Right away he asked me if I had a gun,\Nand I said, "No, of course not. " And he told me, "Well, you better\Nthink about getting one. This is America, not France. Okay?" And I said to him, "I have no idea\Nhow to shoot a gun... ...and I have no interest\Nin firearms whatsoever. " And that's when he pulled out his gun,\Nlike this, and he went: "Well, one day, you're gonna have\Nsomething like this in your face... ...and if you wanna have a long life... ...you're gonna have to choose\Nbetween you or them. " And then they left. And the next morning\NI called for an application to get a gun. Me with a gun.\NI mean, that's really scary. But then I realized\Nsomething was wrong. The way that cop had pulled his gun out,\Nand everything, right? So I canceled my demand\Nfor the gun... ...and I called the police and tried\Nto complain about that cop. - What happened with that?\N- It was so much paperwork... ...and then I got scared,\Nwith my shitty student visa... - Thought you'd get deported?\N- Exactly. I gave up... ...and forgot about the whole thing. - Well, I guess I never forgot.\N- Obviously. But still, you know,\NI really enjoyed being there. - There's lots of things I miss in the U. S.\N- Yeah? Like what? Well... The overall good mood\Npeople have there. Like, even if it can be\Nbullshit sometimes. Like, "How you doing?" "Great. "\N"How you doing?" "Great!" "Have a great day!" I don't know. Parisians can be\Nso grumpy. Have you noticed? No, everybody seems\Npretty happy to me. - They're not happy. No.\N- They're not happy? No, they are. I don't know. I just\Nmean French men. They drive me nuts. What is it? What about them? Well, they're very nice.\NThey're great, you know, to be around. They love food, wine,\Nthey're great cooks. But I've had really bad luck with them. Why? What do you mean? - Well, I guess they're not as...\N- What? What's the word? - Horny? They're not as horny.\N- Horny? Wait, listen to me on this one. In that\Nregard, I am proud to be an American. And you should be.\NIn that regard only. Have you ever spent time\Nin Eastern Europe? Eastern... No, I don't.\NThank you. I remember as a teenager\NI went to Warsaw... ...when it was still\Na strict communist regime. - Which I don't approve of at all.\N- Sure you don't. - No, I don't.\N- I'm just kidding. But anyway, something about\Nbeing there was very interesting. After a couple of weeks,\Nsomething changed in me. The city was quite gloomy and gray... ...but after a while,\Nmy brain seemed clearer. I was writing more\Nin my journal... ...ideas I'd never thought of before...\N- Communist ideas? - Listen, I'm not...\N- I'm sorry, I... - Okay.\N- Go on. Okay. I'll send you to a gulag later. No. But it took me a while to figure out\Nwhy I felt so different. One day, as I was walking\Nthrough the Jewish cemetery... ...I don't know why,\Nbut it occurred to me there... ...I realized that I had spent the last\Ntwo weeks away from most of my habits. TV was in a language\NI didn't understand... ...there was nothing to buy,\Nno advertisements anywhere... ...so all I'd been doing was... ...walk around, think, and write.\NMy brain felt like it was at rest... ...free from the consuming frenzy.\NIt was almost like a natural high. I felt so peaceful inside.\NNo strange urge to be somewhere else... ...to shop... It could have seemed\Nlike boredom at first... ...but it became very, very soulful. It was interesting, you know? Can you believe it was nine years ago\Nwe were walking around Vienna? - Nine years? No, that's impossible.\N- No, it was. It feels like two months. But it was summer '94. Do I look any different? I do? I'd have to see you naked. - What?\N- I know, I'm sorry. Your hair was different back then.\NIt was like... - It's the same... Oh, down.\N- Yeah, take it down. Down. Okay, it was down. Okay. Well? Voilà. So? Okay, come on. Tell me. Skinnier, I think. A little thinner. Did you think I was fat before? - No...\N- Yeah, you thought I was a fatty. No, you thought I was a fatty. You\Nwrote a book about a fat French girl. - No, listen.\N- Oh, no. Seriously, all right? You look beautiful. Do I look any different? No. Not at all.\NActually, you have this line. - I know.\N- It's like a scar. - A scar? Like a gunshot wound?\N- No, no, no. I like it. I'm sorry. I had this funny...\NWell, horrible dream the other day. I was having this awful nightmare\Nthat I was 32. And then I woke up,\Nand I was 23. So relieved. And then I woke up for real,\Nand I was 32. - Shit, man. It happens.\N- Scary. Time goes faster and faster.\NApparently, it's because... ...we don't renew synapses after\Nour 20s, so it's downhill from then on. I like getting older, you know?\NLife feels... I don't know, it feels more immediate.\NLike I can appreciate things more. No, me too, actually. I really love it. I was once... ...a drummer in a band. - You were?\N- Yeah. We were pretty good, actually. But the lead-singer guy, he was just so\Nobsessed with us getting a record deal. It's all we talked about, thought about,\Ngetting bigger shows. Everything was just focused on\Nthe future all the time. And now... ...the band doesn't even exist anymore. And looking back\Nat the shows we did play... ...even rehearsing, it was just\Nso much fun. I just... Now I'd enjoy every minute of it.\NCould I have a drag of that? Well, your book has been published.\NThat's a pretty big deal. You've been all around Europe.\NAre you enjoying every minute of it? - Not really.\N- Not really? No. - Do you have another one of those?\N- Yes, of course. Here. In my field, I see these people that...\NOh, sorry. Come into it with big,\Nidealist visions... ...of becoming the leader\Nthat will create a better world. They enjoy the goal,\Nbut not the process. - Right.\N- But the reality of it is... ...the true work of improving things\Nis in the little achievements. - That's what you need to enjoy.\N- What do you mean, exactly? I was working for this organization\Nthat helped villages in Mexico. And their concerns was how\Nto get the pencils... ...sent to the kid\Nin those little country schools. It was not about big,\Nrevolutionary ideas. It was about pencils. I see the people that do the real work,\Nand what's really sad is that... ...the people that are\Nthe most giving, hardworking... ...and capable of making\Nthis world better... ...usually don't have the ego\Nand ambition to be a leader. They don't see any interest\Nin superficial rewards. They don't care if their name\Never appear in the press. They actually enjoy the process\Nof helping others. - They're in the moment.\N- Yeah, but that's so hard... ...you know, to be in the moment.\NI mean, I feel like I'm... ...designed to be slightly dissatisfied\Nwith everything, you know? It's like always trying\Nto better my situation. I satisfy one desire,\Nand it just agitates another. And then I think, to hell with it, right?\NDesire's the fuel of life. You know? Do you think it's true... ...that if we never wanted anything,\Nwe'd never be unhappy? I don't know. Not wanting anything,\Nisn't that a symptom of depression? Yeah, that is, right?\NI mean, it's healthy to desire, right? Yeah. I don't know. It's what all\Nthose Buddhist guys say, right? Liberate yourself from desire,\Nand you'll find... ...you already have everything you need.\N- But I feel alive... ...when I want something more\Nthan basic survival needs. Wanting, whether it's intimacy\Nwith another person... ...or a pair of shoes, is beautiful. I like that we have those\Never-renewing desires, you know? Maybe it's this sense\Nof entitlement. You know, like whenever you feel like\Nyou deserve that new pair of shoes? It's okay to want things, as long as you\Naren't pissed off if you don't get them. Life's hard. It's supposed to be. If we didn't suffer, we wouldn't\Nlearn a thing, you know? So, what, are you Buddhist,\Nor something? - No.\N- No? Why not? I don't know. The same reason I don't\Nreally consider myself anything, really. I decided a long time ago that\NI was gonna be open to everything... ...but not buy into any one\Nand only belief system. I went to this Trappist monastery\Na couple years ago. - Trappist?\N- Yeah, they're Catholic. Cistercian. - Why did you do that?\N- Why? I'd been doing some reading. Thought it'd be cool. Have you ever\Nspent any time with monks or nuns? - No. It's not really my style.\N- No? Well, I expected them to be all\Nglowering and stern, but they weren't. They were quick to laugh,\Nreally easy to be around. Seriously, very attuned to everything,\Nthey were just... You know, they weren't trying\Nto hustle anybody. They're trying to live and die\Nin peace with God... ...or whatever part of them\Nthey feel is eternal. It was just so refreshing to be around. You realize that most\Nof the people that you meet... ...are trying\Nto get somewhere better. They're trying to make more cash,\Nget a little more respect... ...have more people admire them.\NIt's exhausting. - No kidding.\N- And it's exhausting to be one yourself. There I am, right, you know,\Nall greedy to be more spiritual. "I want to be a better person,"\Nyou know? You can't escape. I had this boyfriend of mine many years\Nago that wanted to be a Buddhist. So he went to Asia to visit some\Nof those monasteries. - I've thought about doing that too.\N- Yeah, you should. I'll tell you why. He was good-looking, and each time\Nhe went to one of the monasteries... ...a monk offered to suck his cock. True story. It all comes down to that, doesn't it? That's why I really admire\Nwhat you're doing. - You know?\N- What do you mean? Sucking cock? - No.\N- No? Wrong answer. No, I was gonna say\Nyou're not detached from life. You're putting your passion into action. Well, I try. You know something?\NI'm gonna be on planes... ...and in an airport\Nfor the next eight hours... I'd just love to see\Na little bit more of Paris. - Would you walk with me?\N- Yeah. - Do you mind?\N- That's great. - Do you want to?\N- Let's do that. Yeah. What do we owe here?\NFour-fifty? No, I got it, I got a little\Nper diem going on here. - This good, for a tip?\N- Yeah, that's fine. - That's more than enough.\N- Throw that in too. - Is there anywhere to go around here?\N- It's sales day today. - What's that?\N- It's when everything's on sale in Paris. It's twice a year. All right, let's go shopping. No, no, no. That's a bad idea.\NI don't wanna inflict that on you. It's madness. Let's just go\Nto this garden path. It's really nice. All right. That sounds\Nbetter than shopping, actually. Not that I wouldn't do\Nwhatever you wanted. Sometimes I don't even need\Nto buy anything. I just get high... ...on trying on\Nand looking at things. Is this where we're going? - Yeah.\N- A therapist will tell you that's good. - Really? Are you ever in therapy?\N- Oh, no. - Do I seem like I'm in therapy?\N- I'm kidding. - Does it help your sex problems?\N- My sex problems? - I'm kidding.\N- Tell me the truth. - We didn't have any problems.\N- No, I'm kidding. - We didn't even have sex.\N- That's a joke, right? No, we didn't.\NI mean, that was the whole thing. - Of course we did.\N- No, no, no, we didn't. You didn't have a condom\Nand I never have sex without one. I'm extremely paranoid.\NThere's no way... I find it scary that you don't\Nremember what happened. No, listen... ...I didn't write an entire book,\Nbut I kept a journal... ...and I wrote the whole night in it.\NThat's what I meant, you idealizing it. All right, listen, I even remember\Nwhat brand of condom we used. That's disgusting.\NI don't wanna hear it. - That's not disgusting.\N- No. Okay, when I get home I'll check my\Njournal from '94, but I know I'm right. - Wait a minute.\N- What? - Was it in the cemetery?\N- No. No, we went to the cemetery\Nin the afternoon. It was in the park, very late at night. - In the park?\N- Wait a minute, wait a minute. I can't... I can't... Is it that forgettable? You really\Ndon't remember? In the park? Okay. Wait a minute,\NI think you might be right... You're messing with me now. - No.\N- Are you messing with me? Okay. No, I'm sorry. I think...\NI mean, you're right, okay? Sometimes I put things in drawers\Ninside my head and forget about it. It's less painful to put things\Naway than live with it. What, so that night was, like,\Na sad memory for you? I didn't mean that night\Nin particular. I meant certain things\Nare better forgotten. I remember that night\Nbetter than I do entire years. - Me too.\N- Really? Well, I thought I did. But maybe I... Maybe I put it away\Nbecause of the fact that... ...my grandmother's funeral was\Nthe day we were supposed to meet. It was a tough day for me,\Nbut it must've been worse for you. It was unreal. I remember looking\Nat her dead body in the coffin... ...at her beautiful hands, so warm,\Nso sweet, that used to hold me... ...but nothing in that coffin resembled\Nwhat I remembered of her. All the warmth was gone. And then I was crying,\Nso confused if I was crying... ...because I was never gonna see her\Nagain or never gonna see you again... I'm sorry. I'm sorry to go on like this.\NI've been a little down this week. - Why?\N- I don't know. Nothing bad, just... Reading your book, maybe? No, but... Thinking of how hopeful\NI was that summer and fall... ...and since then it's been kind of a... I don't know. Memory is a wonderful thing if\Nyou don't have to deal with the past. "Memory is wonderful if you don't\Nhave to deal with the past. " Can I put that\Non a bumper sticker? If you wrote a book about our night,\Nthat's a good title. - And it could be a total different book.\N- Yeah, there'd be no sex scenes. - But you know what?\N- What? Now that we've met again... ...we can change our memory\Nof that December 6. It no longer has that sad ending\Nof us never seeing each other again. Right. I mean, I guess a memory's\Nnever finished as long as you're alive. Yeah, I know. I have this memory\Nfrom my childhood... ...I realized recently never happened.\N- What? Well, when I was 8 or 9,\Nmy mom was so paranoid... ...when I was walking home\Nfrom my piano lesson at night... ...she'd warn me about dirty old men\Ngiving me candies... ...and then showing me\Ntheir pee-pees. She was so obsessed with it that,\Nlater in life, you know... ...I had this image in my head\Nthat this really happened. To the point that I even associated sex\Nwith that walk home. I mean, and sometimes,\Neven now, when I'm... When I'm having sex, I see myself\Nwalking down that street. I swear. It's so weird, right? - Is that street nearby? I mean, could...?\N- Could we? No. Very far. Did you ever keep a journal\Nwhen you were a kid? Yeah. On and off, I guess. It's funny, I read one of mine... ...from '83 the other day.\N- Yeah? And what really surprised me is... ...that I was dealing with life\Nthe same way I am now. I was much more hopeful and naive... ...but the core, and the way I was\Nfeeling things, is exactly the same. It made me realize\NI haven't changed much at all. I don't think anybody does. People don't want to admit it, but it's\Nlike we have these innate set points... ...and nothing much that happens to us\Nchanges our disposition. - You believe that?\N- I think so. I read this study where they followed\Npeople who'd won the lottery... ...and people who'd become paraplegics. You'd think one extreme is gonna make\Nyou euphoric and the other suicidal. But the study shows that,\Nafter about six months... ...as soon as people had gotten used to\Ntheir new situation... ...they were, more or less, the same.\N- The same? Yeah. Like, if they were basically\Nan optimistic, jovial person... ...they're now an optimistic, jovial\Nperson in a wheelchair. If they're a petty, miserable asshole... ...they're a petty, miserable asshole\Nwith a new Cadillac, a house and a boat. So I'll be forever depressed\Nno matter what great things happen? - Definitely.\N- Great. No, come on, are you depressed now? No, no, I'm not depressed. But sometimes I worry\NI'll get to the end of my life... ...feeling I haven't done all I wanted to.\N- Well, what do you want to do? I... I want to paint more,\NI want to play my guitar every day. I want to learn Chinese.\NI want to write more songs. There's so many things I want to do,\Nand I end up doing not much. All right, well, let me ask you this:\NDo you believe in ghosts or spirits? No. - No?\N- No. - Okay, what about reincarnation?\N- Not at all. - God?\N- No. - All right.\N- That sounds terrible. No, no, no. But I don't want to be one of those\Npeople that don't believe in any magic. - So then, astrology?\N- Yes, of course! - There we go.\N- That makes sense, right? You're a Scorpio,\NI'm a Sag, we get along. No, no, no. There's an Einstein quote\NI really, really like. He said, "If you don't believe\Nin any kind of magic or mystery you're basically as good as dead. "\N- Yeah, I like that. I've always felt there was some kind of\Nmystical core to the universe. But, more recently, I've started to think\Nthat, me, my personality, whatever... That I don't have any permanent\Nplace here, you know. In eternity or whatever, you know. And the more I think that, I can't go\Nthrough life saying this is no big deal. This is it. This is actually happening.\NWhat do you think is interesting? What do you think is funny?\NWhat is important? You know, every day's our last. When I feel that way, I usually\Ncall my mom to tell her I love her. - Yeah?\N- And she's always: "Are you okay? Do you have cancer?\NAre you gonna commit suicide?" It's almost not worth it. So, what about us? - What about us?\N- No, what I mean is... ...if we were both going to die tonight...\N- Like the apocalypse was coming? No, that's too dramatic... But what if\Njust the two of us were going to die? I mean, would we talk\Nabout your book? - The environment? Or...\N- If today was our last day? Yeah, what would we talk about?\NWhat would you tell me? - Well...\N- That's hard, huh? - No, no, I'll do it.\N- Okay. I definitely would\Nstop talking about my book. - I would probably drop the environment.\N- Okay. But I would still want to talk about,\Nyou know, the magic in the universe. - I'd just want to do it from a...\N- What? ...a hotel room, you know... ...in between sessions of us\Nwildly fucking until we die. Wow. Well, why waste time\Nwith an hotel room? Why not do it right there on a bench? Come here, come here, come here. Okay. We're not gonna die tonight. All right. Too bad. I'm sorry. That was an extreme example. - I'm sorry.\N- Okay. What I... My point was, you know... ...to truly communicate with\Npeople is very hard to do. No, I know, most of our\Nday-to-day exchanges... Yeah, no, I mean... ...not to bring everything back to sex...\N- But why not? No, this example, this friend of mine,\Nshe was talking about... - She and her boyfriend... Problems in bed.\N- Right. And how when they had been dating\Nfor a year she started telling him... ...what he could do to please her more,\Nand it freaked him out. - Why?\N- Totally. He thought it meant\Nhe was a bad lover... Maybe she shouldn't have\Nwaited so long. - After a year...\N- But men are so easily offended. - What, more than women?\N- Definitely on that subject. - You think so?\N- Yeah, yeah. Well, maybe it's because, you know... ...men are easier to... To please.\N- To please? - Well, I don't know.\N- Yeah, they are. They're definitely. Anyway, this friend,\Nshe was telling me... ...next time she dates a man,\Nshe's gonna make a little questionnaire... ...about what they like and dislike...\N- What, written down, or out loud? Yeah, mostly written down. But it wouldn't be just yes or no.\NIt would be a bit more complex than that. Like, for example, if the question is:\N"Are you into S & M?" The answer could be: "No, but a good\Nspanking once in a while doesn't hurt. " Right, or like:\N"Do you like talking dirty in bed?" - That kind of thing?\N- Yeah, but not just like any dirty talk. Just "What specific word\Nwould you like to hear?" - What, me?\N- Well, yeah. For example what specific word\Nwould you like to hear? I don't know. What do you feel about the word\N"pussy"? I love it. Good. It's amazing what perverts we've\Nbecome in the past nine years. At least now we don't have to pretend\Neach new sexual experience... ...is, like, a life-altering event. I know. By now, you've stuck it in\Nso many places it's about to fall off. And I can't realistically expect you've\Nbecome anything but a total ho. - Yeah, thank you.\N- No, I'm s... - That's true. What can you do?\N- What can you do? So, what kind of songs do you write?\NI didn't know you did that. - What kind?\N- Yeah, sure. - I don't know, just songs.\N- Like? Like, some are about,\Nyou know, people. Relationships. One's about my cat. - Sing one.\N- No, I can't. I don't have a guitar. - Come on. A cappella.\N- No, no, no. I'm not singing a song without a guitar.\NYou're nuts. Why not? - No, okay. Not now. No.\N- One. If not now, when? You want to meet\Nhere in six months with a guitar? I'll fly all the way over here. - You may or may not make the Métro.\N- Okay, that's funny. - We've got to get back.\N- We'll be all right. - You're gonna miss your flight.\N- All right. <i>We can walk down La Seine.\NIt's nice.</i> Okay. - So you're flying back to New York?\N- Yeah, yeah. So I read in that article that\Nyou're married with a kid. That's great. Yeah, he's... He's 4. - What's his name?\N- Henry. Little Hank. - He's so much fun.\N- Oh, wow, I'm sure. - Your wife, what does she do?\N- She teaches elementary school. - Do you have kids?\N- Yes, two... Shit! - What?\N- I left them in the car! With the windows up, six months ago!\NThink they're okay? No, I'm kidding.\NNo, but I want to have kids someday. - I'm just not ready yet.\N- No? - I'm in a good relationship, though.\N- Oh yeah? That's good. - What's he do?\N- He's a photojournalist. He does war coverage. He's away a lot, which is good\Nbecause I'm so busy. But isn't that dangerous? Aren't a lot of\Nthose guys getting killed these days? He promises me he doesn't take risks,\Nbut I often worry. He goes in this trance when\Nhe photographs something. - What do you mean?\N- Well, once we were in New Delhi... ...and we passed a bum on the... - A bomb?\N- A bum. A homeless. All right, right. He looked like he needed help, but his\Nfirst reaction was to photograph him. He went really close to his face,\Nfixing his collar... ...totally detached from the person. But don't you have to be like that\Nto be good at that job? Yeah, I mean, I'm not... I'm not judging him.\NWhat he does is essential and incredible. All I'm saying is that\NI could never do it. Let's get on that boat. Come on. - No!\N- Come on, it'll be fun. - You don't have time!\N- They're about to take off. I've got 5 more minutes.\NDo you have a cell phone? - Yeah.\N- All right, I've got that driver's number. I can call him to pick us up\Nat the next stop. I've never been on those boats.\NIt's for tourists, it's embarrassing. Okay. All right. No, I'll get it, I'll get it. All right. All right, all right. Thank you. - So are you in love with that guy?\N- What guy? - The war photographer.\N- Yes, of course. So do you have that cell phone? Oh, yeah. - Okay, let's see...\N- Okay. What do I tell him? <i>Tell him to pick you up at\NQuai Henri Quatre.</i> <i>Oh, shit. Quai...?</i> <i>Henri Quatre. Quai Henri Quatre.</i> <i>Henri Quatre.</i> <i>What's wrong with you? No, do you\Nwant me to...? Henri Quatre.</i> - Henry Four?\N- Yes! - Come on, why didn't you say so?\N- I'm sorry. Okay. Yeah, is this Philippe? Yeah. Philippe, this is Jesse Wallace. Yeah. Well, listen, I'm on\None of those boats, right? And we're gonna arrive at Henry Four. At Port Henry Four.\NYou know what that is? All right, great.\NAnd you have my bags, right? Yeah, so we'll be there in...\NI don't know, it's the next stop. Okay. Au revoir. - It's okay?\N- Yeah, yeah. Oh, wow. - Notre Dame, man. Check that out.\N- Oh, wow. I heard this story once about when\Nthe Germans were occupying Paris... ...and they had to retreat back. They wired Notre Dame to blow... ...but they had to leave one guy\Nin charge of hitting the switch. And the guy, the soldier,\Nhe couldn't do it. He just sat there, knocked out\Nby how beautiful the place was. Then, when the Allied troops\Ncame in... ...they found all the explosives\Nlying there and the switch unturned... ...and they found the same thing\Nat the Sacré-Coeur, Eiffel Tower... ...couple other places, I think. Is that true? I don't know.\NI always liked the story, though. Yeah, that's a great story. But you have to think that Notre Dame\Nwill be gone one day. There used to be another church\Nat the Seine, right there. - What, right in the same spot?\N- Yeah. You know, this is great.\NI've never done this. - Yeah.\N- I forget about how beautiful Paris is. It's not so bad, being a tourist. - Thanks for getting me on the boat.\N- You're welcome. I think that book that I wrote\Nwas like building something... ...so that I wouldn't forget the details\Nof the time that we spent together. You know, like, just as a reminder,\Nthat once, we really did meet. You know, that this was real,\Nthis happened. I'm happy you're saying that,\Nbecause... I mean, I always feel like a freak because\NI'm never able to move on like this: People just have an affair,\Nor even entire relationships... ...they break up and they forget. They move on like they would have\Nchanged brand of cereals. I feel I was never able to forget\Nanyone I've been with... ...because each person had their own\Nspecific qualities. You can never replace anyone.\NWhat is lost is lost. Each relationship, when it ends,\Nreally damages me. I never fully recover. That's why I'm very careful\Nwith getting involved... ...because it hurts too much. Even getting laid,\NI actually don't do that... ...because I will miss of the person\Nthe most mundane things. Like I'm obsessed with little things. Maybe I'm crazy,\Nbut when I was a little girl... ...my mom told me\Nthat I was always late to school. One day she followed me to see why. I was looking at chestnuts falling from\Nthe trees, rolling on the sidewalk... ...or ants crossing the road, the way\Na leaf casts a shadow on a tree trunk. Little things. I think it's the same with people. I see in them little details,\Nso specific to each of them... ...that move me and that I miss\Nand will always miss. You can never replace anyone... ...because everyone is made of such\Nbeautiful, specific details. Like, I remember the way your beard\Nhas a bit of red in it... ...and how the sun\Nwas making it glow... ...that morning right before you left. I remembered that, and I missed it. Really crazy, right? Now I know for sure. You wanna\Nknow why I wrote that stupid book? - Why?\N- So you'd come to a reading in Paris... ...and I could walk up to you and ask,\N"Where the fuck were you?" No... You think I'd be here today? I'm serious. I think I wrote it,\Nin a way, to try to find you. Okay, that's... I know that's not true... ...but that's sweet of you.\N- I think it is true. What were the chances\Nof us ever meeting again? After that December,\NI'd say almost zero. But we're not real anyway, right? We're just characters\Nin that old lady's dream. She's on her deathbed,\Nfantasizing about her youth. So of course we had to meet again. Oh, God. Why weren't you there\Nin Vienna? - I told you why.\N- I know why, I just... I wish you would have been. Our lives might have been\Nso much different. You think so? I actually do. Maybe not. Maybe we would have\Nhated each other eventually. What, like we hate each other now? You know, maybe we're...\NWe're only good at brief encounters... ...walking around in European cities,\Nin warm climate. Oh, God. Why didn't we\Nexchange phone numbers and stuff? Why didn't we do that? Because we were young and stupid. Do you think we still are? I guess when you're young\Nyou just believe... ...there'll be many people\Nyou'll connect with. Later in life you realize\Nit only happens a few times. And you can screw it up, you know.\NMisconnect. The past is the past.\NIt was meant to be that way. You really believe that?\NThat everything's fated? Well, you know, the world might be\Nless free than we think. Yeah? When given these exact circumstances,\Nthat's what will happen every time. Two part hydrogen, one part oxygen,\Nyou'll get water every time. No, I mean, what if your grandmother\Nhad lived a week longer, you know? Or passed away a week earlier?\NDays, even? Things might have been different. - You can't think like that, it's...\N- You shouldn't on most things, but... It's just, on this one, it seemed like\Nsomething was off, you know. In the months leading up to my wedding,\NI was thinking about you all the time. Even on my way there, I'm in the car, a\Nbuddy of mine is driving me downtown... ...and I'm staring out the window\Nand I think I see you... ...not far from the church, right... ...folding up an umbrella\Nand walking into a deli... ...on the corner of 3th and Broadway. And I thought I was going crazy.\NBut now I think it probably was you. I lived on th and Broadway. You see? So, what is it like to be married?\NYou haven't talked much about that. I haven't? How weird. I don't know. We met, you know,\Nwhen I was in college. And we broke up and got back together\Nfor a period of years, and then... What? We were sort of back together\Nand she was pregnant... ...so marriage. What is she like? She's a great teacher, a good mom. She's smart, pretty, you know. I remember thinking at the time... ...that so many of the men\Nthat I admired most... ...that their lives were dedicated to\Nsomething greater than themselves. So you got married because\Nmen you admired were married? No, no. It's more like I had this...\NThis idea of my best self, you know? And I wanted to pursue that... ...even if it might have been\Noverriding my honest self. You know what I'm saying? In the moment, I remember thinking\Nit didn't much matter, the who of it all. I mean, that nobody is gonna be\Neverything to you... ...and that it's just the action\Nof committing yourself... ...you know, meeting\Nyour responsibilities, that matters. I mean, what is love, right,\Nif it's not respect, trust, admiration? And I... I felt all those things. Cut to the present,\Nand I feel like I'm running a nursery... ...with somebody I used to date,\Nyou know. I mean, I'm like a monk, you know. I mean, I've had sex less than 0 times\Nin the last four years. - What, what? You laughing at me?\N- No. - It sounds pathetic?\N- What monastery do monks have sex...? Okay, you're right, I'm doing better\Nthan most monks. But I do, I feel like if somebody\Nwere to touch me... ...I would dissolve into molecules. Well, we're here. We've gotta go.\NCome on. Shit. - I'm sorry to hear that, you know.\N- What? You're not that happy\Nwith your marriage. - This friend of mine, she's a shrink...\N- How's she doing? She's a mess, but... No, she said she's been dealing\Nwith couples that are breaking up... ...for the same reason.\N- What reason is that? They all expected, after a few\Nyears of living together... ...for the passion, that desire,\Nto be the same. - Yeah, right.\N- It's impossible. And thank God... ...we'd end up with aneurysms in that\Nconstant state of excitement, right? We'd do nothing at all\Nwith our lives. Would you have finished your book\Nif you were fucking every five minutes? I might have welcomed the challenge,\NI mean... It's natural for your wife\Nafter the birth of your son... ...to give all her love to the little one.\N- Of course. If she was obsessed with sex,\Nriding you like a wildcat... That wouldn't make any sense, right? Everything you're saying makes sense.\NIt's not about sex. No, I know. It's obvious. I... You know, couples\Nare so confused lately. I think it must be that... ...men need to feel essential\Nand they don't anymore. It's been imprinted in their head\Nfor so many years... ...that they had to be the provider. Like, I'm a strong, independent woman\Nin my professional life. I don't need a man to feed me... ...but I still need a man to love me\Nand that I could love. - So your driver's here.\N- Yeah. Well, I guess this is goodbye. - You better give me your...\N- No, no. Why don't we just\Ngive you a ride home? - Well, I can take the Métro. I'm fine.\N- No, I... My flight's not until 0.\NI'll be arriving two hours early. This way we can keep talking. - Monsieur, can...?\N- It's not on the way. You told him where you are\Nand all that? Yeah. - He knows where he's going?\N- Yes. Glad somebody does. - But this is better than the Métro, right?\N- Definitely. I was thinking, for me it's better I don't\Nromanticize things as much anymore. I was suffering so much all the time. I still have lots of dreams,\Nbut they're not in regard to my love life. It doesn't make me sad,\Nit's just the way it is. Is that why you're in a relationship\Nwith somebody who's never around? Yes, obviously I can't deal with\Nthe day-to-day life of a relationship. Yeah, we have this\Nexciting time together... ...and he leaves and I miss him,\Nbut at least I'm not dying inside. When someone's always around me,\NI'm suffocating. No, wait, you just said\Nthat you need to love and be loved. Yeah, but when I do,\Nit quickly makes me nauseous. It's a disaster. I mean, I'm really happy\Nonly when I'm on my own. Even being alone, it's better than sitting\Nnext to a lover and feeling lonely. It's not so easy for me\Nto be a romantic. You start off that way, and after\Nyou've been screwed over a few times... ...you forget about your delusional ideas\Nand you take what comes into your life. That's not even true.\NI haven't been screwed over... ...I've just had too many\Nblah relationships. They weren't mean,\Nthey cared for me... ...but there were no real connection\Nor excitement. At least, not from my side. God, I'm sorry, is it really that bad? It's not, right? You know, it's not even that.\NI was... I was fine until I read\Nyour fucking book. It stirred shit up, you know? It reminded me how\Ngenuinely romantic I was... ...how I had so much hope in things... ...and now it's like I don't believe\Nin anything that relates to love. I don't feel things for people anymore. In a way, I put all my romanticism\Ninto that one night... ...and I was never able to feel\Nall this again. Like, somehow this night\Ntook things away from me... ...and I expressed them to you,\Nand you took them with you. It made me feel cold,\Nlike love wasn't for me. I don't believe that.\NI don't believe that. You know what? Reality and love\Nare almost contradictory for me. It's funny, every single of my exes,\Nthey're now married. Men go out with me, we break up,\Nand then they get married. And later they call me to thank me\Nfor teaching them what love is... ...and that I taught them to care\Nand respect women. - I think I'm one of those.\N- I want to kill them! Why didn't they ask me? I would have\Nsaid no, but they could have asked! I know it's my fault because\NI never felt it was the right man. Never. But what does it mean,\Nthe right man, the love of your life? The concept is absurd. We can only be\Ncomplete with another person. - It's evil, right?\N- Can I talk? I guess I've been heartbroken\Ntoo many times and then I recovered. So now, you know, from the starts,\NI make no effort. - I know it's not gonna work out.\N- You can't do that. You can't live trying to avoid pain... ...at the expense...\N- Those are words. I've gotta get away from you. - Stop the car, I wanna get out.\N- No, don't... - Keep talking.\N- It's being around you. Don't touch me, you know.\NI want to get on a cab. No, don't. No, no, keep going. Listen, I'm just so happy...\NThank you, just keep going. All right. Look, I'm just so happy,\Nall right, to be with you. I am. I'm so glad you didn't\Nforget about me, okay? No, I didn't.\NAnd it pisses me off, okay? You come here to Paris,\Nall romantic, and married. Okay? Screw you. Don't get me wrong,\NI'm not trying to get you. I mean, all I need is a married man. There's been so much water under\Nthe bridge, it's not even about you. It's about that moment in time\Nthat's forever gone. You say that, but you didn't\Neven remember having sex, so... Of course I remembered. - You did?\N- Yes. - Women pretend things like that.\N- They do? What was I supposed to say?\NThat I remember the wine in the park... ...and us looking up at the stars fading\Naway as the sun came up? We had sex twice, you idiot! All right, you know what,\NI'm just happy to see you. Even if you've become an angry,\Nmanic-depressive activist... ...I still like you,\NI still enjoy being around you. And I feel the same. I'm sorry.\NI don't know what happened, I just... - I had to let it all out.\N- Don't worry about it. I'm so miserable in my love life,\Nin my relationship. I always act as...\NLike, you know, I'm detached. But I'm dying inside.\NI'm dying because I'm so numb. I don't feel pain or excitement,\NI'm not even bitter, I'm just... You think you're the one\Ndying inside? My life is 24/7 bad. - I'm sorry.\N- No, no. I mean, the only happiness I get\Nis when I'm out with my son. I've been to marriage counseling... ...I've done things I never thought\NI would have to do. I've lit candles,\Nbought self-help books, lingerie. - Did the candles help?\N- Hell, no. I don't love her the way\Nshe needs to be loved... ...and I don't even see a future for us,\Nbut then I look at my little boy... ...sitting across from me,\Nand I think I'd suffer any torture... ...to be with him for\Nall the minutes of his life. I don't want to miss out on one. But then, there's no joy or laughter\Nin my home, you know? - I don't want him growing up in that.\N- No laughter? That's terrible. My parents have been\Ntogether 35 years... ...and even when they fight\Nthey end up laughing. I don't want to be one of those people\Nwho are getting divorced at 52... ...and falling down into tears, admitting\Nthey never really loved their spouse... ...and they feel their life has been\Nsucked up into a vacuum cleaner. You know, I want a great life.\NI want her to have a great life... ...she deserves that. But we're just living in the pretense\Nof a marriage, responsibility... ...you know, all these ideas\Nof how people are supposed to live. But then I... I have these dreams... What dreams? I have these dreams,\Nyou know, that... ...I'm standing on a platform... ...and you keep going by on a train... ...and you go by, and you go by,\Nand you go by, you go by. And I wake up with\Nthe fucking sweats. And then I have this other dream... ...where you're pregnant in bed\Nbeside me naked... ...and I want so badly to touch you, but\Nyou tell me not to and you look away. And I... And I touch you anyway... ...right on your ankle, and your skin is\Nso soft that I wake up in sobs, all right? My wife is there looking at me,\Nand I feel I'm a million miles from her. And I know that there's\Nsomething wrong, that I... God, that I can't keep living like this... ...that there's gotta be more to love\Nthan commitment. But then I think that\NI might have given up... ...on the whole idea of romantic love. That I might have put it\Nto bed that... That day when you weren't there. You know, I think I might\Nhave done that. Why are you telling me all this? I'm sorry. I don't know.\NI'm... I should... I shouldn't have. You know, it's so weird. People think they are the only one\Ngoing through tough times. I mean, when I read the article,\NI thought your life was perfect. A wife, a kid, published author. But your personal life\Nis more of a mess than mine. I'm sorry. Well, I'm glad it's good for something. - This is where you live?\N- Yeah. So you're just relieved that I'm\Nin even more deep shit than you are? Yes, you've made me feel better. Oh, good, I'm glad. No, I really wish you the best. It's not because I'm incapable of having\Na good relationship or a family... ...that I wish everyone to be\Ndoomed like me. I'm sure you'd make... Be\Na great mom someday. - Really? You think so?\N- Yeah... ...a few antidepressants, you know,\Nyou'll do great. - Okay, say stop.\N- Stop. - Okay.\N- You ready? Okay. - So I want to try something.\N- What? I want to see if you stay together\Nor if you dissolve into molecules. How am I doing? Still here. Good. I like being here. Is this your apartment? No, I live down there. - Down there?\N- Yeah. Monsieur, I'm gonna walk her\Nto her door. This is incredible. - This is where you live?\N- Yeah. - How long have you been here?\N- Four years. - So tell me...\N- What? Is it all true about your dreams... ...or did you say that to hopefully\Nget in my pants? I said that to get in your pants. - I use that all the time.\N- Oh, okay. Does it work? You know. Sometimes. Here's my kitty. Oh, so cute.\NLook at him. You know what I love\Nabout this cat? Every morning I bring him\Nto the courtyard... ...and every single morning he looks\Nat everything like it was the first time. Every corner, every tree, every plant. Smells everything\Nwith his little cute nose. Oh, I love my kitty. I love my kitty. - What's his name?\N- Che. Che? - What?\N- Commie. No, "che" in Argentina means "hey. " - Okay.\N- Yes. Oh, baby. Oh, yes, yes, yes. We're having a little party.\NIt's so much fun. - So...\N- So. You know what? I was thinking,\Nwould you play me one of your songs? - You're gonna miss your flight.\N- I won't. I'm gonna be in the airport for\Nover an hour, reading... ...wishing you'd played me\None of your songs. One song? Okay, but quickly. Okay. God, I love these old staircases. - Hold this.\N- What, for me? Hey there, buddy. Che. - Would you like some tea?\N- Yeah, sure. Wow. - Is chamomile okay?\N- Yeah. Great. <i>- Merci.\N- Messy?</i> <i>- You think my apartment is messy?\N- No, no. Merci.</i> <i>- Merci beaucoup.\N- Ah, merci.</i> I meant to tell you,\Nyour French has improved a lot. - Really?\N- Yeah. Yeah, you've really\Nmastered the language. All right, all right, what song\Nare you gonna play me? No, I can't. It's too embarrassing.\NIt's been... Whoa. No way. No way. I came up here,\Nyou cannot crap out on me now. One song. Anything will be great. But listen, you're gonna laugh at me. - You think so?\N- Yes. I doubt it. Okay. What do you want to hear? I have... I have three songs in English. One's about my cat... ...one's about my ex-boyfriend...\NWell, ex-ex-boyfriend... ...and there's one about... Well, it's just a little waltz. A waltz? Yeah. - Play the waltz.\N- Right. I haven't played it in a while.\NYou sure? Okay. All right, the waltz. <i>Let me sing you a waltz</i> <i>Out of nowhere, out of my thoughts</i> <i>Let me sing you a waltz</i> <i>About this one-night stand</i> <i>You were, for me, that night</i> <i>Everything I always dreamt of in life</i> <i>But now you're gone</i> <i>You are far-gone</i> <i>All the way to your island of rain</i> <i>It was, for you, just a one-night thing</i> <i>But you were much more to me</i> <i>Just so you know</i> <i>I don't care what they say</i> <i>I know what you meant\NFor me that day</i> <i>I just want another try</i> <i>I just want another night</i> <i>Even if it doesn't seem quite right</i> <i>You meant, for me, much more</i> <i>Than anyone I've met before</i> <i>One single night with you, little Jesse</i> <i>Is worth a thousand with anybody</i> <i>I have no bitterness, my sweet</i> <i>I'll never forget this one-night thing</i> <i>Even tomorrow, in other arms</i> <i>My heart will stay yours until I die</i> <i>Let me sing you a waltz</i> <i>Out of nowhere, out of my blues</i> <i>Let me sing you a waltz</i> <i>About this lovely one-night stand</i> - No, one more! Please, please.\N- No! It was our deal. One... One song. No, no, no. You can have your tea and then... - All right, let me ask you one question.\N- What? Do you just plug that name in\Nfor every guy that comes up here? Yes, of course. What do you think, that I wrote\Nthe song about you? Are you nuts? Is this you? Little cross-eyed Celine? - Yes. That's funny.\N- Cute. - Is that your grandmother?\N- Yeah. Oh, wow. - You want some honey?\N- Yeah, sure. Did you ever see Nina Simone\Nin concert? No, I never did.\NI can't believe she's gone. I know, it's so sad. Thanks. It's hot. I saw her twice in concert. She was so great. That's one of my favorite songs of hers. She was so great. She was so funny in concert too. She would... She would be\Nright in the middle of a song and then... ...you know, stop... ...and walk from the piano all the way\Nto the edge of the stage. Like, really slowly. And she'd start talking to someone\Nin the audience. "Oh, yeah, baby. Oh, yeah. I love you too. " And then she'd walk back.\NTake her time, no hurry, you know. She had that big, cute ass. She would move. And then she would go back to the piano\Nand play some more, you know. And then she would, I don't know... ...just start another song\Nin the middle of another. You know, like,\Nstop again, and be like: "You over there,\Ncan you move that fan. You're cute. Oh, yeah. " Baby, you are gonna miss that plane. I know.
