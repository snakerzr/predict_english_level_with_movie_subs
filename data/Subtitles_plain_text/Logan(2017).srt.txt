Sleepwalking.<br/>Between the ice caps, the pornographers,<br/>poisoned water, mutants... it's all connected. BURT: Hey, Clyde. It's 2029. Why are we still<br/>talking about mutants? Hey, it's me. I'm in the car. Yeah, it was a good trip. Killed it up and down<br/>the fence. BOYS: (CHANTING)<br/>USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! (MAN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY) GABRIELA: Wolverine. I knew it was you. - Oh, fuck.<br/>- Please! I'm in trouble! You're the only one<br/>that could help! (GABRIELA SPEAKING SPANISH) Get the fuck away from me! (GABRIELA CONTINUES<br/>SPEAKING SPANISH) (IN ENGLISH) Please! Logan! Who was that? I don't know, some crazy lady.<br/>Don't worry. (BREATHING HEAVILY) (COUGHING) (DOOR OPENING) As I live and breathe,<br/>the Wolverine. And he's a junkie now. Who the fuck are you? You know, you got some<br/>buckshot in your door. I heard you was in Phoenix. But then, last night,<br/>some friends of mine in Texas HP called... and told me they found three dead cholos<br/>in a pullout on 54. Not unusual, I know. Except one was missing a hand,<br/>another one a leg. So they was thinking... it was either an escaped tiger<br/>or Freddy Krueger. But neither one of them<br/>can drive... one being fictional,<br/>the other one extinct. And since the wheel lugs<br/>they found belonged to a '24 Chrysler... and, well... this is a '24 Chrysler. She found you yet? Gabriela? See... I'm not looking for you,<br/>Wolvie. Well, not really.<br/>I'm looking for someone who's looking for you. She took something of mine<br/>when I wasn't looking. Something for which<br/>I am responsible. Mexican lady. Has her sights on you now. Doesn't ring any bells? I don't know any Gabriela,<br/>so get the fuck out of my car. Oh. You know... I know<br/>what you're hiding, amigo. The old cue ball<br/>south of the border. What do you want? A little co-operation. I'm a fan, by the way. Fuck, fuck! (INDISTINCT ANNOUNCEMENTS<br/>OVER PA) LOGAN: No, Mr. Esperanza, no. I know I said June,<br/>but I need the boat now. Why would that mean<br/>the price go up? (COUGHS) Listen to me. I know you wanted 70... Okay, what if I could<br/>put together $45,000 cash right now? Hello? Hello? Shit. Hey, Sam. Morning. (COUGHS) CHARLES: "I know that virtue<br/>to be in you, Brutus. "As well as I do know<br/>your outward favor. "Well, honor is the subject<br/>of my story." He's having a bad day. LOGAN: They're all bad days. He needed these six hours ago. This is not enough, you know. Won't see us through the week. I'm working on it. Your turn. I've had a rough night. Poor you. In other news,<br/>he told me last night he's communicating<br/>with someone. He's not talking to anybody. Don't be so sure. He's got all these details. I thought that tank was<br/>supposed to act as a barrier. - It's got them cracks in it.<br/>- Just please stop. Bottom left. You're not listening. He's been asking questions<br/>again about why we're here. I think he's trying to<br/>read my mind. That's what these are for. (GROANS) CHARLES:<br/>Eating his curds and whey Then came a big spider<br/>Which sat down beside her And frightened Miss Muffet... (DOOR OPENING) (SIGHS) Friends, I have<br/>good news for you today! It's not about what you do. It's not about your deeds. You can't<br/>live up to God's rules. He knows that you can't.<br/>It's okay, we're imperfect. Make way, sir. I said make way! The new Quesalupa<br/>from Taco Bell! Get it with chicken!<br/>Get it with steak! And with the cheese baked<br/>right in the shell... it's the next big thing! Go now while supplies last. Who are you? You know who I am. You're the man<br/>who puts me to sleep. We both could use some sleep. No! No! (PANTING) What are you doing to me? Charles. Come on, now.<br/>(GRUNTING) (GROANING) (HIGH-PITCHED RINGING) (GRUNTING WEAKLY) (WHIMPERING) (RINGING STOPS) (BOTH GASPING) (GASPING) How long have I been here? (LOGAN COUGHS) CHARLES: What are these? LOGAN:<br/>You remember what they are. The shots mellow the seizures. The pills<br/>keep them from happening. How about you blow on them<br/>to make them safe? Fuck off, Logan. So you remember who I am now. I always know who you are. It's just sometimes<br/>I don't recognize you. Take the pills. You leave me alone<br/>with that fucking albino. He doesn't listen to me. I know a damn speciation<br/>when I see one. A what? Speciation.<br/>New mutant, a young one. There are forces<br/>trying to kill them. - Forces?<br/>- They want help. (GRUNTS) Forces, forces. It's too bad you're not<br/>in that business anymore. They don't want me,<br/>they want you. (SCOFFS) Oh, yes, that's how<br/>fucking stupid they are. They're waiting for you<br/>at the Statue of Liberty. The Statue of Liberty<br/>was a long time ago, Charles, a long time. There are no new mutants.<br/>Understand? Hasn't been a new one born<br/>in 25 years. Not anywhere. You always thought... we were part of God's plan. But maybe... Maybe we were God's mistake. What a disappointment you are. When I found you... you were pursuing a career<br/>as a cage fighter. A warm capper to a life<br/>as an assassin. Hooked on barbiturates. You were an animal. But we took you in. I gave you a family. And they're gone now. Logan. Logan... What did you do? What did you do? Answer me! Why are we here? No one should live like this. Drugged in a fucking tank! - It's for your own good.<br/>- No, it's not! You're waiting for me to die. (CROSSING BELLS RINGING) (GRUNTING) (TRAIN CLACKING) (DOOR OPENS) I don't wanna fight... but there's things<br/>we need to discuss. What things? Well, would it be<br/>considered nagging... if I was to repeat<br/>my previous observation... that the dose is too low<br/>to suppress the seizures? It's what the guy gave me. Wasn't in a position<br/>to make demands. I almost died this morning. - That seizure was...<br/>- It was barely a minute. It felt a lot longer than<br/>a minute. I couldn't breathe. You're less affected. You know<br/>he needs a higher dose. And I know you got more money<br/>squirreled away. That money's<br/>to get us out of here. No, not us. You and him. You're saving<br/>to buy a Sunseeker. "Sun" is the keyword. I hardly see myself cowering<br/>below decks like Nosferatu. Do you? Folding your underpants,<br/>and making him spotted dick. Found this in your pocket. (SNIFFS) Adamantium. If you are planning<br/>to blow your brains out... could you wait till you're<br/>out on the high seas? - I just mopped these floors.<br/>- I don't need this shit. A year ago,<br/>you asked me to help you. And God knows I've tried. But I can't help you, Logan,<br/>not really... if you're not<br/>going to talk to me. I hear you at night.<br/>You're not sleeping. You don't wanna<br/>talk about that. Or the booze you're drinking. Or the pus you're wiping away<br/>from your knuckles. Or the blood<br/>I wash from your clothes. Or the fresh wounds<br/>in your chest. The ones that aren't healing. And I'm pretty sure... you don't wanna talk<br/>about the fact that you can't read the label<br/>on that bottle. It says, "lbuprofen." (MUG SHATTERS) That was my favorite mug. Stay out of my shit. Something's happening to you,<br/>Logan. On the inside you're sick.<br/>I can smell it. (DANCE MUSIC PLAYING) BRIDESMAID: Best night ever! (ALL CHEERING) Hey, driver. WOMAN: I love you. I love you. You're such a doll. Mr. Logan. Oh, Jesus. Please. We need a ride. Not available. Call a cab. My name is Gabriela Lopez. I don't wanna<br/>know your name, lady. There are men after us. - We need to get out of here.<br/>- (LOGAN COUGHS) Go north, cross to Canada. Anyone can do that job. I'll give you $50,000. How did you find me, huh? 'Cause you are fucking up<br/>my life, lady! The people after you,<br/>they're on my ass now! Sightings were posted. - Laura, go inside.<br/>- What sightings? People said someone<br/>who looked like the Wolverine was in El Paso, driving. Said he looked old. (WINDOWPANE SHATTERS) WOMAN: Hey! I told you<br/>to stop it with that ball! - Bad girl!<br/>- No, please. - I told you, bad girl!<br/>- No, please. Mamacita 's gonna<br/>have to pay for that. Stop, please. No. Shit! They're gonna<br/>have to pay for damages. (MUMBLES) And she has cash. I've seen it. You should get your fat ass<br/>back in your office. You'll get your money. Don't let her call anyone,<br/>please. They will find us.<br/>They will kill us. (GABRIELA BREATHING HEAVILY) I am a nurse. Was. In Mexico City. When did that happen? This morning. Near the border. I got away from them, but... ...now they know my car. Look, I gotta go. No, wait. Please. Here. Please, wait! Look. Look. Here, take this.<br/>It's $20,000. Here. Take us to this address. You can have $30,000 more<br/>when we get there. My friends there<br/>will give it to you. They will be waiting. They will give you anything. Where did you get this? My boyfriend. He wants to kill me<br/>and take her. And that's your daughter? Yes. I know<br/>you're still good inside. I know you want to help us. You don't know<br/>anything about me. Please! I promise, there will be<br/>no problems if we leave now. I can't just leave<br/>to North Dakota! - We have to be there Friday.<br/>- Or what? Or we miss our chance<br/>to cross. Please. You have to. Please. Please. - I like those.<br/>- Huh? They make you look younger. Charles, listen. I gotta go away<br/>for a few days, okay? I got a long ride<br/>for some good money... but when I get back,<br/>we're gonna get outta here. We're gonna<br/>drive down to Yelapa. We're gonna<br/>get ourselves a boat. And we're gonna<br/>go live on the ocean. Will you be safe there? Yeah. We'll be safe. Look what Logan got us,<br/>Charles. Be back in a few days. (TRAIN CLACKING) (SIGHS) Shit. (SIRENS WAILING IN DISTANCE) (LOGAN COUGHING) - Logan.<br/>- Yeah? What happened? Did something go wrong? The job was wrong<br/>to begin with. (SNIFFS) Logan! Logan! What? Who does this belong to? Who's that? Thought you were supposed to<br/>see shit coming. I can track mutants. I'm a glorified truffle pig,<br/>not a clairvoyant. Go inside<br/>and keep Charles quiet. Go inside now! You need to turn around,<br/>asshole. This is private property. Yes, it is. In fact, I believe it belongs to a multinational<br/>smelting company... based in Shanghai. Where are you keeping<br/>the old man? Hmm? Is he over there? Or is he there? That'd be smart. I'd like to meet him. I'm told the HSA<br/>classifies his brain as a weapon<br/>of mass destruction now. Damn shame,<br/>what happened back east. He's been dead for a year. I need the girl. What girl? The one that goes along with<br/>that ball you're holding. There's no girl here. I know you went to the motel. Yeah, I was called there. There was no girl.<br/>It was just the woman. Just the woman.<br/>Such as she was. So, you saw Gabriela. But you didn't call me.<br/>That hurts. You didn't shoot<br/>the poor thing, did you? - No, did you?<br/>- I asked you first. - I don't like guns.<br/>- Of course. I wish you'd called me, Logan. Like I asked. See? You're not the only one<br/>that's been enhanced. (GIRL SCREAMS) Logan. Logan! This is Laura. Caliban, come! This is who<br/>I've been telling you about. This is Laura. We've been waiting for you. (SPEAKING SPANISH) Come, come here. It's okay. Come. Laura. It's okay. It's okay. Come. Come. Come. It's okay.<br/>You can stay here, Laura. It's safe. We can look after you here. Come on. Looks like ex-military.<br/>Bounty hunter, maybe? Worse. Is he by himself? Yeah, not for long. You get him back in his ride, take him out to the wash<br/>and dump him. What if he wakes up<br/>before I get there? Text me where you are.<br/>We'll pick you up. (CHARLES SPEAKING SPANISH) Yes. Logan. - Logan.<br/>- Hey. Hey! You'll get it back<br/>after I figure out what you and your mother<br/>have got us into. - No, Logan.<br/>- What? - I think the...<br/>- (LAURA STRAINING) Logan, the woman that you met,<br/>that's not her mother. - So she talks?<br/>- We're communicating. Communicating. Take these now. We have to get out of here.<br/>It's not safe here anymore. And you can't have an attack<br/>out there, you understand? Yes, but this is the mutant<br/>that I told you about. - She needs our help.<br/>- She's not a mutant. - Yes, she is!<br/>- What's her gift, Charles? Eating? Pipe throwing? (RUMBLING) It's okay. (SPEAKING SPANISH) (GRUNTING) Oh, yeah. Take the gun. Dump the body. Text me<br/>when you're on the way back. You have anything else<br/>you need? Food for the kid? (SPITS) You're fucked now, mutie. (RUMBLING) It's okay. (SPEAKING SPANISH) CHARLES: Choo-choo.<br/>LOGAN: It's not a choo-choo. It's okay. Sit down. - We gotta go.<br/>- What? - What's going on? Where?<br/>- Stay here. - Don't move.<br/>- Where are we going? Hey, don't worry.<br/>He will be back for you. Logan, the girl. You've got to<br/>go back for the girl. Logan, what about the girl? Logan. Logan, we mustn't forget<br/>about Laura. She's not our problem. Shit! Ah, shit! (MEN SPEAKING SPANISH) (BREATHING HEAVILY) (MAN SPEAKING SPANISH) Logan. Yeah, I'm thinking. The child. Logan,<br/>we mustn't forget Laura. - Please be quiet.<br/>- Logan. Huh. - Charles Xavier.<br/>- Where's Caliban? America's most wanted<br/>octogenarian. I'm a nonagenarian, actually. (GRUNTS) Ah. Where's Caliban? Why don't you tell me<br/>where the girl is first? Or I could ask Cue Ball.<br/>He seems quite friendly. I told you, she's not here. Where's Caliban, motherfucker? Well, I left him<br/>in the same ditch he was gonna leave me in. - (GROWLING)<br/>- (MEN GRUNTING) (YELLING) (GUNS COCKING) (PANTING) Jesus, Wolverine, seeing you like this<br/>just breaks my damn heart.

Ah! - (YELLING)<br/>- (MAN SCREAMING) Sit back. Bring me the tracker. You. Who the hell are you? Hey! I asked you a question.<br/>Who are you? You know who she is, Logan. No, I don't. Does she remind you<br/>of anybody? I read about you<br/>when I was a kid. I believe you're thinking<br/>of someone else. Hmm. (PANTING) Now, if I'm not mistaken,<br/>you used to work for my team. You were helping round up<br/>all those old mutes. What changed? You got religion? I'm gonna need you to do one more thing<br/>for the good guys... and track one more<br/>special mute for me. I'm not helping you. Of course, you'd say that. But I got a theory that<br/>people don't really change. Beware of the light. Caliban, I bet that's what<br/>your mama told you every day when you was a kid. (CLICKING TONGUE) Beware of the light. (WHIMPERING) (CALIBAN SCREAMING) Now, let's not bring out<br/>the worst in each other. The girl is not worth it,<br/>trust me. She's not a natural fuck-up<br/>like you. She's a business mistake,<br/>a R&D gone bad. There's liability. They can't have things<br/>with patents running around,<br/>hurting people, can they? We need to get her<br/>off the board before she hurts anybody else. Someone you care about, maybe. - (SKIN SIZZLES)<br/>- (GROANING) So, get to sniffin'. My name is Gabriela López. I am a nurse. And for 10 years, I worked for Transigen Research<br/>in Mexico City. Transigen is owned<br/>by an American company. What I am about to show you<br/>is illegal... in the U.S. And Canada. (CHILDREN SINGING) They told us we were part<br/>of a pharmaceutical study. But, of course,<br/>that was a lie. These children<br/>were born in Transigen. They were born here... and have never left. They have never seen<br/>the sun or the ocean... rain or snow... or any of God's creatures. They have no<br/>birth certificates... no names... besides the ones<br/>we have given them. They were raised in<br/>the bellies of Mexican girls. Girls no one can find anymore. Their fathers are<br/>semillas genéticas... special seeds in bottles. (CHILDREN SINGING<br/>IN SPANISH ON VIDEO) - Birthday? No birth.<br/>- DR. RICE: María. We do not dress them up<br/>for Halloween. We do not call them "baby"<br/>or kiss boo-boos. Don't think of them<br/>as children. Think of them as things... with patents and copyrights. Comprende? Si, señor. GABRIELA: They thought<br/>we were too poor and stupid to understand. We're poor, yes... but we are not stupid. TRAINER: Use your powers. (BOY GRUNTING) (YELLING) (RUMBLING) GABRIELA: This is business. They are making soldiers. Killers. (SIGHS) These are babies<br/>ofmutantes... (BEEPS) CHARLES: North Dakota.<br/>LOGAN: Mmm. You took that woman's money. You said you would take<br/>the child there. (RATTLING) What is she? She's your daughter, Logan. Alkali has your genetic code. Not just mine. Logan... I don't want to talk about it. I don't wanna<br/>hear about it anymore. - Logan...<br/>- Just stop. I have to pee. (RATTLING) Last ride. (COIN RATTLES) You're welcome. CHARLES: Stop it.<br/>For God's sake, I can do this myself! LOGAN: Yeah, well,<br/>you're not doing it. Just get on with it. Not with you standing there. Trust me, I'm not lookin'. (COUGHS) (SIGHS) (CASH REGISTER WHIRRING) (CLEARS THROAT) STORE CLERK: Hello. Hi, there! You know you gotta pay<br/>for that, right? (CHIPS CRUNCHING) Hey! Where's your<br/>mommy and daddy, huh? (SIGHS) Come on. That's enough. These, too. (LAURA GROWLING) - Shit!<br/>- Not okay! Sorry. Um, do you sell<br/>phone chargers? Uh... (LAURA GRUNTING) Come on. Get in the car. (VEHICLES PASSING) - (COUGHING)<br/>- (CELLPHONE BUZZING) GABRIELA: As the children<br/>became older... Laura. Laura. ...they became more difficult. They could not be controlled. (GABRIELA SPEAKING SPANISH) The company made their bodies<br/>into weapons. Tried to teach them to kill. But they did not<br/>want to fight. - (GUARD SPEAKING SPANISH)<br/>- (BOY YELLING) A soldier who will not fight<br/>is useless. (SIGHS) Inside this building... they are working on<br/>something new. Something they think is better<br/>than the children. Something they say<br/>is without a soul. MAN: Would you like to hear<br/>my full lab report, Dr. Rice? DR. RICE: You can't get<br/>good sushi here. It's the Mexican equivalent<br/>of Denver, Colorado. (INDISTINCT TALKING) GABRIELA: They must have<br/>been successful. About a week ago, they told us<br/>to shut our program down. (GIRL SCREAMING) They started putting<br/>the children to sleep. (INDISTINCT CLAMORING) (PIERCE LAUGHING) We are going to save<br/>as many children as we can. I read about a place,<br/>up north. A place for mutants. They call it Eden. (GABRIELA SPEAKING SPANISH) (MAN SCREAMING) GABRIELA:<br/>If you are watching this... it means that I am dead. I am not sure if<br/>any other children survived. We were separated. There is no more money. That was a lie. She's not my child. But I love her. You may not love her. But she is your child. Please. I beg you... take her to safety. (SIGHS) (CARS HONKING) (DANCE MUSIC PLAYING<br/>IN DISTANCE) (PEOPLE CHATTERING) Is this where<br/>we're hiding out? LOGAN: We're not hiding out. We're gonna get<br/>a couple of hours' sleep... clean up,<br/>get some new clothes, get a new ride<br/>and get outta here. WOMAN: (ON SPEAKER)<br/>Harrah's Hotel and Casino welcomes you to Oklahoma City. Please keep right<br/>for valet parking. LOGAN: Hey. The fun never stops<br/>at Harrah's Hotel and Casino. Hey, keep it out front,<br/>all right? (UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING) Come on, let's go. (PEOPLE EX CLAIMING) (MACHINES RINGING) Hey, Laura. Let's go. We need clothes. FEMALE VOICE: Going up. No, no, stop. Not a toy. - Uh, no, no, sorry, chair.<br/>- What? Okay. - Push up again.<br/>- Thank you. FEMALE VOICE: Going up. Come here. Stand there.<br/>Just stand there. Logan, it's yours. What? I'm not gonna wear it now. In the room. We'll get<br/>changed in the room. You're a low-down,<br/>lying Yankee. Prove it. (GUNSHOT) (HORSES NEIGHING ON TV) This is a very<br/>famous picture, Laura. It's almost 100 years old. (LOGAN COUGHING HEAVILY) (SINGING ON TV)<br/>In life, in death, oh, Lord Abide with me I first saw this picture at the Essoldo Cinema<br/>in my hometown... when I was your age. ALL: Who art in heaven<br/>Hallowed be thy name Thy kingdom come,<br/>thy will be done Shit. SHANE: (ON TV) I've heard<br/>that you're a low-down, Yankee liar. WILSON: Prove it. (GUNSHOTS) You read these<br/>in your spare time? Oh, yeah, Charles,<br/>we got ourselves an X-Men fan. You do know<br/>they're all bullshit, right? Maybe a quarter of it<br/>happened, and not like this. In the real world, people die. And no self-promoting asshole in a fucking leotard<br/>can stop it. This is ice cream<br/>for bed-wetters. Logan... Her nurse has been feeding her<br/>some grade-A bullshit. I don't think<br/>Laura needs reminding of life's impermanence. Didn't you say something about<br/>finding us a new ride? Two more pills in one hour. Give 'em to him. BOY: (ON TV) Why, Shane? A man has to be<br/>what he is, Joey. Can't break the mold. I tried it<br/>and it didn't work for me. Joey, there's no living<br/>with a killing. There's no going back<br/>from one. Right or wrong, it's a brand. A brand sticks. Now you run on home<br/>to your mother, and tell her<br/>everything's all right. And there aren't any more guns<br/>in the valley. STORE CLERK: Who are you guys? More cops? 'Cause I told the other guys<br/>everything that I... (MAN SCREAMING) MAN: Get up!<br/>In your cage, tracker. You did your job. LOGAN: Fellas. Shit. Knock yourselves out. WOMAN: I'll tell you what.<br/>Eight grand... I'll have her freshly painted<br/>for you, new tires... mounted, balanced,<br/>and complete paperwork. I'll give you 10 as-is, if you can forget<br/>the paperwork. Well, you still need<br/>new tires, man, they're bald. How long will that take? An hour. (COUNTRY MUSIC PLAYING) (SIGHS) Jesus.

Many are noting a similarity to the Westchester incident<br/>over a year ago... that left over 600 injured... and took the lives<br/>of seven mutants, including several<br/>of the X-Men. Knock it off. (DOOR LOCK CLICKING) I said, knock it off! She's a child, Logan. And, point of fact,<br/>she's your... How long has it been<br/>since you took your meds? (EXHALES) Tell me,<br/>how long has it been? I don't know! Two days. You saw<br/>what happened yesterday. If that shit<br/>had gone on any longer, everyone in that casino... I did what I had to do<br/>to save Laura. You didn't do anything. You just freaked out<br/>and had a fucking seizure! I guess you prefer me<br/>pharmaceutically castrated, rambling on like a lunatic. So much easier for you. Easier? Jesus! There is nothing easy<br/>about you, Charles, nothing! Yes, yes, please be<br/>like the rest of the world... blaming someone else<br/>for your boring shit. I know, Pop, I'm such<br/>a giant disappointment. You honestly derive<br/>no sense of purpose... from what we're doing? Okay, what are we doing? Hmm? There is a young mutant<br/>sitting in our car. Yeah, I see that. And where we're taking her,<br/>there are others. Does that mean nothing to you? Yeah, means nothing to me. Especially since<br/>Nurse Gabriela... made all that Eden shit up<br/>with fucking comic books. What are you talking about? Give those to him, will you? Take out two pills<br/>and give them to him. - Logan! Logan!<br/>- Give 'em to him. Now! I wanna see it. (EX CLAIMS) PIERCE: Dr. Rice.<br/>It's under control... (INDISTINCT CHATTER) Motherfucking auto-trucks. Language, Logan. And you're screaming<br/>at a machine. Oh, what? She can gut a man<br/>with her feet, she can't hear<br/>a few naughty words, huh? CHARLES:<br/>She can learn to be better. You mean, better than me? Actually, yes. And, by the way,<br/>Laura's foot claws... are the obvious result<br/>of her gender, you know. LOGAN: Is that a fact? In a pride of lions,<br/>the female... is both hunter and caregiver. LOGAN: Good to know. She uses her front claws<br/>for hunting... and the back claws<br/>defensively. LOGAN: Oh, yeah? Thus, ensuring their survival. - (COUGHS)<br/>- (HORN HONKS) Hey, hey! (HORSES NEIGHING) CHARLES: We should help them. No, we have to keep going.<br/>Someone will come along. Someone has come along. FEMALE AUTOMATED VOICE:<br/>Alert. Alert. Whoa, whoa, whoa. (SHUSHING) Hey, uh, you need a hand? (TRUCK STARTING) Ready? Go! Ah. Good, got it. Come on, let's get home. Laura! Thank you so much<br/>for your help. - I'm Kathryn.<br/>- James. This is my son, Nate. - Hi.<br/>- Hey. That's your daughter? Yeah, that's Laura,<br/>and that's my dad... Chuck. Come on, Laura, let's go. Well, can we show<br/>our appreciation and treat the three of you<br/>to a decent meal? We don't live far from here. - Uh, no, thanks.<br/>- That would be lovely! (HELICOPTER BLADES WHIRRING) (INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER) My name is Dr. Rice. But you can call me Zander<br/>if you like. My colleague tells me you've been<br/>somewhat resistant. He believes you've been dispensing<br/>delayed information... to allow your friends<br/>to stay one step ahead. I'm offering you<br/>the possibility of redemption, Caliban. To protect the world,<br/>and in the process, save your friends. The girl is a rather<br/>small price to pay for that. Unlike you, she's impure. She wasn't made by nature. She's a mistake of my own. I did what I could and they burned me<br/>and beat me. Your colleagues are savages. (CHUCKLES) I agree. The Reavers<br/>were very ineffective. But I'm bringing<br/>new tools to bear. But I still need someone to point us<br/>in the right direction. No, I can't help you. - (PANTING)<br/>- Breathe, breathe. Now, what does he have?<br/>The old man. Alzheimer's? ALS? A degenerative brain disease in the world's most<br/>dangerous brain? What a combo. (HORSE NEIGHING) KATHRYN: Be nice.<br/>Now, you know we got company. CHARLES: That's wonderful. KATHRYN:<br/>Everybody, have a seat. WILL: Nate, sit up. James, why don't you sit<br/>at the end of the table? KATHRYN: You wanna say grace?<br/>Say grace, baby. Uh, thank you, God,<br/>for this food... and for our new friends,<br/>the Howletts. Mmm. They came to our aid. - Amen.<br/>- Amen. WILL: Here we go.<br/>Here you go, Charles. Thank you, sir. LOGAN: Mmm-hmm. Oh, there's plenty more<br/>if she wants. She's fine. Thank you. CHARLES: This is delicious. KATHRYN: Oh, thank you.<br/>CHARLES: It's so good. Where are you all headed? - Uh... Oregon.<br/>- South Dakota. Um... Well, Oregon<br/>and then South Dakota. Vacation? Uh... Yes. Uh, long overdue. We're city folk. Always wanted to take<br/>a road trip, see the country. Um...<br/>And meet the people in it. KATHRYN: That sounds lovely. Been trying to get Will here to take a vacation<br/>for years now. Oh. If we go traipsing<br/>all over the country, who's gonna take care<br/>of this place? KATHRYN:<br/>Exactly. I say, let it go. And live off what? The Lord will provide. WILL: I'm still waiting for<br/>the Lord to provide me - with a new thresher.<br/>- (LAUGHS) KATHRYN: All the same,<br/>I'd love to travel someday. And I bet you will. - I could drop out of school.<br/>- Okay, let's not go that far. I mean, I'll do it. KATHRYN: No. No.<br/>NATE: Why not? You wanna travel,<br/>I wanna travel. KATHRYN: Son. Son. WILL: That sounds good<br/>to you, right? This is the perfect plan. Why would you want to do that,<br/>Nate? Careful, you're speaking to<br/>a man who ran a school... for a lot of years.<br/>Right, Charles? (STAMMERS) Yes, it was a... It was a special needs school.<br/>Um... Uh-huh.<br/>That's a good description. He was there, too. Oh, yeah, no. Um... - I got kicked out a few times.<br/>- (LAUGHS) I wish I could say<br/>you were a good pupil, but the words would choke me. (ALL LAUGHING) (INDISTINCT CHATTER<br/>AND LAUGHTER) (HORSE NEIGHING) Ma'am, I can't thank you<br/>enough for this. Uh, it was great. But we have a long drive<br/>ahead of us, so... But you need to rest,<br/>don't you? LOGAN: Yeah, we'll find<br/>a motel somewhere. The nearest one<br/>is two hours from here and it's not even that nice. We have a perfectly fine<br/>room upstairs for your father<br/>and your daughter and you can sleep in the living<br/>room on the convertible. Kathryn, it's very,<br/>very nice of you, but we really should go. We can leave<br/>early in the morning. Break of dawn, as it were. (LOGAN STAMMERS) Okay, why don't we wash up,<br/>Pop? Okay. Sit. KATHRYN: Um, sweetie,<br/>you want some dessert? Two days on the road, only one meal,<br/>and hardly any sleep. She's 11, I'm fucking 90. Well, that's 101 reasons<br/>to keep moving. I'm not a box of avocados,<br/>Logan. LOGAN: And then what?<br/>We stay the night, then what? Then we take her<br/>to her friends in Eden. And then we buy the Sunseeker. Take the pills. (WATER SPURTING) WILL: Oh, shit! (PIPES CREAKING) - What's going on?<br/>- Nate! Go fill up the tub<br/>before we lose pressure. Honey, check the sink. KATHRYN:<br/>They shut it off again. They are just not going to<br/>let this thing go. Well, you might as well<br/>handle it now. It can wait till the morning.<br/>We just had rain last night. KATHRYN:<br/>We got three houseguests and a sink full of dishes. All right, all right. The pump station<br/>that supplies us is a mile<br/>and a half from here. Sometimes it gets itself<br/>shut off. - By assholes.<br/>- WILL: Hey! No. My son is happy<br/>to go with you. No, no, no, that's fine. The men that do this,<br/>sometimes they can be... - I can go.<br/>- No, you got homework. All right, I'll go. Just, uh,<br/>let me get my dad settled. (STRAINING) All right. WILL: I'm just saying, I don't<br/>care what the lawyer says. KATHRYN: But it's dangerous. WILL: I'm not gonna<br/>hurt our chances. (LOGAN PANTING) Want TV? There's TV here. I'm fine. Okay. Get some rest. You know, Logan... this is what life looks like. A home,<br/>people who love each other. Safe place. You should<br/>take a moment and feel it. Yeah. It's great. Logan. Logan! You still have time. Charles, the world is not<br/>the same as it was. We're taking a risk hanging<br/>around here, you know that. And where we're going, Eden... it doesn't exist. Her nurse got it<br/>from a comic book. You understand? It's not real. It is for Laura. It is for Laura. Get some rest. Canewood Beverage bought up<br/>everything out here, except for us. When we wouldn't sell,<br/>they tried eminent domain... then screwing with our water. Couple of months ago,<br/>somebody poisoned our dogs. LOGAN: So, out on the highway<br/>today, those trucks... WILL: (SIGHS)<br/>Who knows. Maybe. Hey, look at 'em. Look like dinosaurs<br/>with their 20-ton bodies and tiny little brains... shucking their cloned-up<br/>super corn. You know<br/>it tastes like shit, too. Why do people eat it? They don't. They drink it.<br/>Corn syrup. It's in those drinks<br/>that everyone's having... to stay awake, cheer up,<br/>feel strong, sexy, whatever. Used to be a time when<br/>a bad day was just a bad day. LOGAN: Mine still are. (MUSIC PLAYING FAINTLY<br/>THROUGH EARPHONES) Those are for<br/>breakaway roping. Those are for barrel racing... and right here<br/>is for pole bending. They're all second,<br/>third place. I'm not too good at it,<br/>but my dad makes me. Do you want to listen? (MUSIC CONTINUES<br/>THROUGH EARPHONES) Do you like it? Um, here,<br/>you can take it for tonight... and I'll get it back from you<br/>in the morning. (WILL GRUNTS) (GATE SQUEAKING) (WATER SPRAYING) Looks like we're gonna<br/>be here a while. (MUSIC PLAYING<br/>THROUGH EARPHONES) (WILL GRUNTS) Should hold it. Yeah. Till next time. (PANTING) Thanks. Hey, so, uh,<br/>how long has your girl - been like that?<br/>- Huh? Mute. Uh, since the beginning. Mmm. Well, in a lot of ways,<br/>I envy you. They get to be Nate's age, with the nonsense that<br/>comes out of their mouths... Makes you wonder<br/>the whole point of it all. Shit. Don't worry. We won't need it. Stay here. Evening, Mr. Munson. What brings y'all this way? Why don't you ask your boys? Mr. Munson, you understand you're<br/>trespassing right now, right? I have an easement with<br/>the previous owner of your property. Huh. Bullshit. "Previous" being<br/>the operative word. Who's this? Just a guy telling you to get back<br/>in your nice truck. Go play Okie dickhead<br/>somewhere else. Hey, Carl... it looks like Mr. Munson<br/>hired some muscle. Looks that way. He's a friend of mine. A friend with a big mouth. I hear that a lot. JACKSON: Then you probably<br/>hear this, too. (GUN COCKS) More than I'd like. Then you know the drill. I'mma count to three... and you're gonna<br/>start walking away. I got rights to this water. - One.<br/>- I have a lawyer now. Two. (GROANS) - Three.<br/>- Ah. Ah. - (SPITS)<br/>- You all right, boss? (GRUNTS) You know the drill. JACKSON:<br/>Pick up my goddamn hat. Get the hell out of here. - You okay, boss?<br/>- Fuck off. Go! (JACKSON GROANS) (ENGINE STARTS) (COUGHING) (CONTINUES COUGHING) You've had training. Some. (CRICKETS CHIRPING) (CLOCK TICKING) (FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING) CHARLES:<br/>Hey, don't wake her yet. Let her sleep another hour. (SIGHS) You know, Logan... this was, without a doubt... the most perfect night<br/>I've had in a very long time. (VOICE CRACKING)<br/>But I don't deserve it. Do I? I did something. Something unspeakable. I've remembered<br/>what happened in Westchester. This is not the first time<br/>I've hurt people. Until today, I didn't know. You wouldn't tell me. So we just kept on<br/>running away from it. I think I finally<br/>understand you. Logan... (GASPS) (GROWLS) - (LAURA SCREAMS)<br/>- (GRUNTS) - (CONTINUES SCREAMING)<br/>- (GROANING) (NATE GRUNTS) - (CLAWS STABBING)<br/>- (NATE GROANING) He's fantastic. You said you only needed<br/>the girl! I told you I was forced<br/>to bring a new tool to bear. Your friends had every chance. And so did you. KATHRYN: Nate? Put her down. (GUN COCKS) (COUGHING) Honey. KATHRYN:<br/>Stay down there, Will!

It wasn't me. (LAURA SCREAMING) DR. RICE: Here he comes. DRIVER:<br/>I could pick him up, meet him halfway. No, no, no.<br/>Let them come to us. We struggled with the X-23s. We assumed,<br/>because they were children... we could raise them<br/>without a conscience. But you can't nurture rage. You must simply design it... from scratch. (LAURA SCREAMING) Who the fuck is that? Will Munson! - (PANTING)<br/>- (CHARLES GROANING) Just hold on, Charles. JACKSON: Munson, God damn it,<br/>come out here! - (PANTING)<br/>- (CHARLES GROANING FEEBLY) JACKSON: Munson! Come out here now! Come out here now, Munson. There's that asshole. Hello, asshole. Listen, I'm willing<br/>to let bygones be bygones. I don't know what<br/>Munson's paying you... but Canewood can start you out<br/>at five G. A week, that is. You best stay<br/>where you are, pal. I'm the law out here. - (GRUNTS)<br/>- No, no, no. What in high... What? Oh, shit! Shoot him! (MEN SCREAMING) We need to intervene. Well, he only listens<br/>to you, Doctor. (MEN SCREAMING) DR.

I was starting to think<br/>I was gonna have to tell... that nice little girl<br/>out in the waiting room... her daddy's gone. (SIGHS) I'd always hoped... that I'd get the chance<br/>to meet someone like you. There's so few of you left. Nice to meet you, too, Doc. (GROANING) But I really<br/>got to get on my way. No, no, don't do that. What you need is rest,<br/>and treatment. You need to check yourself<br/>in somewhere. - I'll be fine.<br/>- No, you're not! I mean, I know<br/>that you're different... but that doesn't<br/>change the fact that something inside you<br/>is poisoning you. You got to check yourself<br/>into a hospital. Find out what it is! I know what it is. Please, mister, if you don't<br/>want to go to a hospital, maybe I can help you. Maybe I can run some tests. Look, Doc. You seem<br/>like a nice guy, all right? You wanna save a life,<br/>save your own. Forget we were here. (COUGHS) Let's go. (CONTINUES COUGHING) Hey! Hey! You can't just take shit,<br/>you know. (KEYS JINGLING) I don't know<br/>how you got me here... but thank you. De nada. Yeah. You can talk? You can talk? What the fuck? Why in the fuck... What's all this bullshit been for the last<br/>2,000 fucking miles? (YELLING IN SPANISH) What? Shut up. Shut the fuck up! Jonah, Gideon,<br/>Rebecca, Delilah, Rictor. What? Who's that? Who is that? Jonah, Gideon,<br/>Rebecca, Delilah, and Rictor. North Dakota. What? North Dakota, por favor. Shit, okay. Look... No. Por favor. This place. Okay?

Those are the names<br/>of the people who just made this...<br/>(COUGHING) They made this whole thing up. Okay? This whole... It happened once, and they just turned it<br/>into a big, fucking lie! - (CONTINUES SPEAKING SPANISH)<br/>- That's all this is. No! Fuck. (COUGHING) No. I know, I understand. This is a long way. You understand? I am not taking you<br/>to North Dakota. I am fucked up.<br/>And I cannot get you there.

Let's go to<br/>fucking fantasyland. (ENGINE STARTS) MAJOR: We understand<br/>the importance of containment, Dr. Rice. But you can't leave<br/>a war zone behind like you did in Juárez. Well, try to remind yourselves that these are all<br/>little killing machines. Machines who would've happily<br/>disemboweled your family. Not all. I was told you want<br/>these assets off-board, dead or alive. Are you changing my brief? No. All right, then. Save tissue from this one. He's a good tracker<br/>and had a high IQ. Here you go. Hey.

Probably what is<br/>killing me now. Anyway... I got this a long time ago... and I kept it as a reminder<br/>of what I am. Now I keep it to, uh... Actually, uh... I was thinking of<br/>shooting myself with it. Like Charles said. I've hurt people, too. You're gonna have to learn<br/>how to live with that. (GROANS) They were bad people. All the same.

We had to wait.<br/>It was the plan. And everyone had till today<br/>to find their way here. If you keep waiting, Alkali will find you<br/>and they will kill you all. You need to get out! We're leaving tomorrow<br/>before dawn. We're gonna cross the border. It's a safe haven. Same coordinates? WOMAN: (ON RADIO)<br/>Yes, between noon and 5:00.

It's an eight mile hike<br/>through there. And you see that pass? LAURA: Mm-hmm. RICTOR: That's the border. That's where we will be safe. Come inside. Laura told me<br/>all that you did for her. She was lucky to have you. Take it. She says it's yours. That's why you did it, right? Yeah, well... Look, I don't need it.<br/>You do, okay? RICTOR: (CHUCKLES)<br/>Suit yourself. (GIGGLING AND CHATTERING) Your friends, they seem nice. Kind of reminds me... Hey, hey, what's going on? Huh? You're with your pals.<br/>You made it. Where will you go? Nearest bar, for starters. Hey, I got you here.<br/>That's all I signed up for. I even gave back the money. Such a nice man. Hey, I never asked for this! All right?<br/>Charles never asked for this. Caliban never asked for this. And they are six feet<br/>under the ground! Now, I don't know what Charles<br/>put in your head... but I am not whatever it is<br/>you think I am, okay? I only met you,<br/>like, a week ago. You got your Rebecca,<br/>your Delilah... your blah, blah, blah,<br/>whatever. Everything you asked for,<br/>you've got it! And it is better this way.

Allow me to introduce myself. I'm Zander Rice. I believe you knew my father<br/>on the Weapon X Program. Yeah. He's the asshole<br/>who put this poison in me. Yes, he was one of them. I think<br/>I might have killed him. I think you're right. Why don't you<br/>show some respect, mutie? You're lookin' at the man<br/>who wiped out your kind. My friend Donald overstates. He makes it sound more brutal<br/>than intended. The goal was<br/>not to end mutant kind... but to control it. I realized we needn't stop perfecting<br/>what we eat and drink. That we could use<br/>those products to perfect ourselves. To distribute gene therapy discreetly<br/>through everything... from sweet drinks<br/>to breakfast cereals. And it worked. Random mutancy<br/>went the way of polio. We embarked<br/>on our next endeavor. Growing mutants of your own. - Precisely.<br/>- Dangerous times, James. You can't... - (DR.
