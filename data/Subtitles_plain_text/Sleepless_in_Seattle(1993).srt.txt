Shut up? Mum\Nnever said shut up to me. Mum never yelled at me. This conversation is finished.\NWhy can't we go to New York? There is no way that we are going on a plane to meet some woman\Nwho could be a crazy,\Nsick lunatic. Didn't you see Fatal Attraction?\NYou wouldn't let me. Well, I saw it!\NAnd it scared the shit out of me. It scared the shit out of every man in America! I'm not leaving till you say yes. I hate you! I hate you!\NI hate you! That's good!\NYou'll have a lot to tell Oprah how your dad destroyed your life because he had to go off for a\Nweekend special at the Holiday Inn! [KNOCKING] Jonah, Clarise is here and I've got to go. Hey, Jonah. Jonah? All right. Jonah, listen,\NI've got to go. Jonah. Hey, Jonah. Jonah! Jessica, honey.\NYou have tell us where he is. Jonah's daddy is very upset. Jessica, this is your father.\NTell us where he is.\NRight this minute! N-Y.\NSAM: What is that? "No way." That's N-W! New York. He's on\Nhis way to New York. What?\NHow? United, 597.\NJESSICA'S MOTHER: Jessica. When does it leave?\NSeven thirty. [CUCKOO CLOCK CHIMES] [♪♪♪] Here you go.\NHere's a nice pin for you for flying with us.\NThank you. You're welcome.\NCan I take this for you? No. Where to, kid?\NEmpire State Building. Hold on. Empire State Building. Get a little further away\Nfrom the curb next time, mac. There it is. What are you going\Nto do up there? Spit off the top? No, I'm going to meet my new mother. Excuse me. I'm Jonah.\NAre you Annie? No, I'm Cynthia. Excuse me, are you Annie? Great table. Thanks. Is something wrong? Can I get you a drink?\NSome champagne? Fine. Fine. Can we have a bottle of Dom DeLuise. [CHUCKLING] Just kidding.\NIt was a joke. He meant Dom Perignon.\NI got it. Ohh. Beautiful view. Walter...\NThere's something\NI have to tell you. [♪♪♪] Hey! Sorry, I have an emergency. [SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY] SAM:\NMoney, money, money, see? [♪♪♪] So he could be on top of\Nthe Empire State Building now? No. I guess he could be. No. It's not him, Walter. It's me. I can't do this. Look, Annie, I love you.\NBut let's leave that out of this. I don't want to be someone\Nthat you're settling for. I don't want to be someone\Nthat anyone settles for. Marriage is hard enough\Nwithout bringing such low\Nexpectations into it. Isn't it? Walter, I don't deserve you. No, I wouldn't put it that way. But okay. You okay? Yeah. [SIGHS] [GASPS] What?\NLook. [♪♪♪] It's a sign.\NWho needed a sign? Walter, I have to go.

You are my family.\NYou're all I've got. I thought she'd be here.\NI thought she'd come. We're doing okay, aren't we?\NI mean, are we okay? Aren't we all right?\NSo far, have I done\Nanything stupid? No. Have I screwed it up for the both of us? No. [HORNS HONKING] [♪♪♪] Observation deck?\NSorry, ma'am, but it's too late. Oh. No, please.\NI really need to get up there. We're closing up.\NNo more runs tonight. Listen... can I just take a look?\NThere's someone\NI was supposed to meet. He's probably not there,\Nbut if I don't at least look,\NI'll always wonder about it. Cary Grant, right?\NYou know that movie? It's one of my wife's favourites. Maybe when we get home, we'll get a dog. JONAH:\NOkay. SAM:\NWhat do you mean, okay? Wouldn't you like to have a dog?\NJONAH: Sure. I'm sorry, ma'am. Empty. Can I take a minute?\NGo ahead. [♪♪♪] I left it by the telescopes. It's you.\NIt's me. I saw you in the street. Are you Annie?\NYes. You're Annie? This must be yours.\NI'm Jonah. This is my dad.\NHis name is Sam. Hi, Jonah. Sam.
